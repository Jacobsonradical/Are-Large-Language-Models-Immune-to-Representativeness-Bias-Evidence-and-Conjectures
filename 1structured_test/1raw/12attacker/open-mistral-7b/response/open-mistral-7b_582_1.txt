To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male. This means that if the attacker was actually female, the witness would have incorrectly identified the attacker as male.

Given that 85% of the city's population is female, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85. If we assume that the witness's errors are random, then the probability that the witness would mistake a female for a male is the same as the probability that the witness would mistake a male for a female, which is 0.20 (given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the event we are interested in is the event that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender, or the event that the attacker is male and the witness mistakes a female for a male.

The probability of the first event is 0.15 (since 15% of the city's population is male). The probability of the second event is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (since the witness mistakes a female for a male 20% of the time, and there is a 85% chance that the attacker is female).

Since the two events are mutually exclusive (either the attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender, or the attacker is male and the witness mistakes a female for a male), their probabilities add up to the overall probability that the attacker is male and the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32.
