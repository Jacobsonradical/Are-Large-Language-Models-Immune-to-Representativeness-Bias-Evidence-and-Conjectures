To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- p: the probability that the attacker is male
- q: the probability that the attacker is female (p + q = 1)

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and erred 20% of the time, we can represent this as follows:

P(witness correctly identifies male | attacker is male) = 0.8
P(witness incorrectly identifies male | attacker is male) = 0.2

Since the witness's gender judgement is independent of the actual attacker's gender, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony:

P(attacker is male | witness testifies male) = P(witness testifies male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) / P(witness testifies male)

Using the given data, we can calculate the probabilities in Bayes' theorem:

P(witness testifies male | attacker is male) = 0.8
P(attacker is male) = p

The probability P(witness testifies male) is the sum of the probabilities that the witness correctly identifies a male and incorrectly identifies a male as male:

P(witness testifies male) = P(witness correctly identifies male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness incorrectly identifies male | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female)

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female with a probability of 0.2, and the city has 15% male population, we can calculate the probability P(witness incorrectly identifies male | attacker is female):

P(witness incorrectly identifies male | attacker is female) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(witness testifies male):

P(witness testifies male) = 0.8 * p + 0.2 * (1 - p)

Plugging this into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is male | witness testifies male) = (0.8 * p) / [(0.8 * p) + (0.2 * (1 - p))]

Given that 85% of the population in the city is female, we can say that the probability of the attacker being female is:

P(attacker is female) = 0.15

We can use this probability to calculate P(witness incorrectly identifies male | attacker is female):

P(witness incorrectly identifies male | attacker is female) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03

Now, we can calculate the probability P(witness testifies male):

P(witness testifies male) = 0.8 * p + 0.03 * 0.15 = 0.8 * p + 0.0045

Finally, we can calculate the probability P(attacker is male | witness testifies male):

P(attacker is male | witness testifies male) = (0.8 * p) / [(0.8 * p) + (0.0045)]

This is a complex equation that cannot be solved directly for p. However, we can use numerical methods to find an approximate value for p. Given the gender distribution in the city, we would expect the probability of the attacker being male to be around 0.15. But the witness's testimony suggests a higher probability. This discrepancy can be explained by the witness's inaccuracy in identifying gender.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is not possible to provide a precise numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is male. However, based on the given information, it is safe to conclude that the attacker is more likely to be male than female, but the probability is not significantly higher than 0.15, the gender distribution in the city.
