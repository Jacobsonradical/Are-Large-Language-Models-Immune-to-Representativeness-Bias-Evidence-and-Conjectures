To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness was correct in identifying gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. However, the witness made an error in this case, identifying the attacker as male. This means that there is a 20% chance that the witness was incorrect and the attacker is actually female, given the witness's error rate.

On the other hand, the city has an 85% female population and a 15% male population. This means that there is a 15% chance that the attacker is male in the general population.

However, since the witness made an error, we need to adjust our estimate to account for this. The probability that the witness was correct and the attacker is male is the product of the witness's correct identification rate and the actual male population percentage. The probability that the witness was incorrect and the attacker is female is the product of the witness's error rate and the female population percentage.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is:

Probability (Attacker is male) = Probability (Witness was correct) * Probability (Attacker is male given witness was correct) + Probability (Witness was incorrect) * Probability (Attacker is female given witness was incorrect)

Probability (Witness was correct) = 0.8 (witness's correct identification rate)
Probability (Attacker is male given witness was correct) = 0.15 (actual male population percentage)
Probability (Witness was incorrect) = 0.2 (witness's error rate)
Probability (Attacker is female given witness was incorrect) = 0.85 (actual female population percentage)

So, the probability that the attacker is male is:

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.29, or 29%.
