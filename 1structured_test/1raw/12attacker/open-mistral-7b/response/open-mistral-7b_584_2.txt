Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the city's gender distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. The city's gender distribution suggests that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. This is our prior probability, which we can denote as P(Male).

2. The witness's reliability suggests that they correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases. This means that when they identify someone as male, they are correct 80% of the time. We can denote this as P(Male|Witness's statement).

However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(Male|Witness's statement) from the reliability data. We would need to know the base rate of males in the population the witness saw, as well as their own error rate when identifying females. Since we don't have this information, we can't calculate an exact probability.

But we can make an approximate estimate based on the city's gender distribution. If we assume that the gender distribution in the witness's sample is similar to the city's gender distribution, then the witness's statement that the attacker is male means that the attacker is likely to be male.

So, our estimate of P(Male) would be higher than 15%, but lower than 80% (the witness's stated accuracy). Since we don't have exact numbers, we can't provide a precise number between 0 and 1. Instead, we can say that our estimate is somewhere between 15% and 80%.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: between 0.15 and 0.8, please note that this is an approximate estimate based on the assumptions made}
