Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's define our events and probabilities:
- H: The attacker is male
- ~H: The attacker is not male (female)
- E: The witness identified the attacker as male

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is given by P(E|H) = 0.8 and the probability of error is P(E|~H) = 0.2.

The prior probability of the attacker being male is P(H) = n_m / (n_m + n_f), where n_m is the number of males in the population and n_f is the number of females. Given that 85% of the population is female, we can calculate the prior probability as P(H) = 15% = 0.15.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.21 (or 21%). This means that, given the witness's testimony and the gender distribution in the city, we estimate that there is a 21% chance that the attacker is male.
