Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. However, we do not have enough information about the sample group that the witness was tested on to accurately adjust the gender distribution for the witness's test. Therefore, we cannot directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to the city's population to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

However, we can make an approximate estimate by assuming that the witness's ability to identify gender is not significantly influenced by the gender distribution in the population. In this case, the probability that the attacker is male would be the same as the error rate the witness has in identifying gender, which is 20%.

So, the estimate would be: {probability: 0.2}
