To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. According to the given information, 15% of the city's population is male.
2. However, the witness's reliability in gender identification is not perfect. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being male as P (male). The witness's statement that the attacker is male can be seen as evidence for the hypothesis that P(male) = 1. However, we know that the witness is not always correct, so we need to adjust our estimate of P(male) based on the witness's reliability.

Let R be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we have:

R = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker
1 - R = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male attacker (or correctly identifying a female attacker)

Given that the witness reports a male attacker, the actual probability that the attacker is male must lie between R and 1, since the witness could have made a mistake.

Now, let's consider the possibility that the witness made a mistake. If the actual probability that the attacker is male is less than R, then the witness must have incorrectly identified a female attacker as male. In this case, the probability that the witness's statement is true (i.e., the attacker is male) is equal to the probability that the attacker is female and the witness makes a mistake in identifying the gender.

The probability that the attacker is female is 1 - P(male) = 0.15 (given population statistics). The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male is 1 - R. Therefore, the probability that the witness's statement is true given that the attacker is female and the witness makes a mistake is (1 - R) * 0.15.

However, since we know that the actual probability of the attacker being male must be greater than or equal to R, the probability that the attacker is female and the witness makes a mistake is less than (1 - R) * 0.15.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement is greater than R.

Now, let's compute the value of R. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we have:

R = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker
= 0.15 (probability of a male attacker) + 0.85 (probability of a female attacker) * Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male
= 0.15 + 0.85 * (1 - R)

Solving for R, we get:

R â‰ˆ 0.22

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the population statistics, is approximately 0.22.
