Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being male can be estimated as follows:

1. From information "a", we know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. From information "b", we know that the witness has an accuracy of 80% in identifying gender and an error rate of 20%.
3. However, the witness misidentified the attacker as male. This means the witness erred in this specific case.
4. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, the probability of the witness making an error in a single case is 0.20.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually female, given the witness's misidentification, is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.
6. However, this probability is based on the city's gender distribution, which we know does not necessarily apply to the group of people the witness was observing.
7. Without more specific information about the gender distribution of the people the witness observed, we cannot accurately calculate the probability of the attacker being male.

In conclusion, based on the information provided, it is not possible to strictly provide a number between 0 and 1 as the probability estimate of the attacker being male.
