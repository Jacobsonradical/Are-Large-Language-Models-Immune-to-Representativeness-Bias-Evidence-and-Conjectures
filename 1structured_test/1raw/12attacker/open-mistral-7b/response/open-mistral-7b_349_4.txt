Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is male
- ~H: the attacker is not male (so, the attacker is female)
- E: the witness's gender identification

The Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

From the information provided, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female, so the probability of the attacker being male is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (the complementary probability)

Calculating P(H|E) gives us:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
