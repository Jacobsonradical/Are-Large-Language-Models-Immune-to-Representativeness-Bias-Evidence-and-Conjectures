Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and they err 20% of the time. However, the city's population is 85% female and 15% male. This means that if the attacker was randomly chosen from the city's population, they would be more likely to be female.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. If the attacker is male, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the gender is 0.8 (from information "a").
2. If the witness correctly identifies the gender, it means the attacker is indeed male. So, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness correctly identified the gender is 0.8 (probability of correct identification).
3. If the witness incorrectly identifies the gender, it means the attacker is actually female. The probability of this error is 0.2 (from information "a").
4. The probability that the attacker is male given that the witness incorrectly identified the gender is 0 (since in this case, the attacker is actually female).

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male:

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the gender (attacker is male) is 0.8 * P(attacker is male)
The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the gender (attacker is actually female) is 0.2 * (1 - P(attacker is male))

The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is the sum of these two probabilities:

total probability = 0.8 * P(attacker is male) + 0.2 * (1 - P(attacker is male))

We need to solve this equation for P(attacker is male). However, without more specific information, it's not possible to provide an exact numerical value. If we assumed that the witness's observations are independent of the city's demographics, then we could find the probability based on the witness's accuracy alone. But since we know that the city's population is heavily female, it seems unlikely that the witness's observations would be independent of the city's demographics.

Therefore, the best we can do is to say that the probability that the attacker is male is less than 0.8, but we cannot provide a specific number without further information.

{probability: less than 0.8, please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and additional context is required for a more precise answer}
