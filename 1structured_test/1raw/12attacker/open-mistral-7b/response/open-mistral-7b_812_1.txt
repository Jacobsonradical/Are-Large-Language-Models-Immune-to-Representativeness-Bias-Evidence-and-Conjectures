To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this means there's a 0.80 probability that the witness was correct (the attacker is actually male) and a 0.20 probability that the witness was incorrect (the attacker is actually female).

Given that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the actual probability of the attacker being male. If the witness was incorrect, the attacker being female would be the only possibility. The probability of this happening is the probability of drawing a female person from the city's population, which is 0.85.

So, the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is 0.80 (witness's correct identification probability) times 0.15 (actual probability of the attacker being male), plus the probability of the attacker being female given that the witness identified the attacker as male, which is 0.20 (witness's error probability) times 0.85 (actual probability of drawing a female person from the city's population).

This can be calculated as follows:

Probability of attacker being male = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.29, or 29%.
