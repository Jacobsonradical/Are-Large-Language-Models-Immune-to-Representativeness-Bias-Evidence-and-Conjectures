Based on the provided information, we have two sources of evidence: the population statistics and the witness's testimony.

1. From the population statistics, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. This means that the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

2. The witness's testimony suggests that the witness incorrectly identified the gender 20% of the time. However, the witness identified the attacker as male. Since the witness is more likely to incorrectly identify a female as male (given the city's population statistics), it's reasonable to assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as male is more likely to be correct than an incorrect identification.

Let's denote the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male as P(M|W), where M represents the event that the attacker is male and W represents the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We can write this probability as:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)]

where ~M represents the event that the attacker is female.

From the witness's testimony, we know that P(W|M) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80. The prior probability of the attacker being male is P(M) = 0.15. However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(W|~M), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.

Since we can't calculate P(W|~M) and we don't have enough information to make a strict probability estimate, I'll provide a qualitative answer: Given that the witness's ability to judge gender is better than random (80% correct), and considering the city's population statistics, it is more likely that the attacker is male than female, but we cannot provide a precise probability estimate without more information.
