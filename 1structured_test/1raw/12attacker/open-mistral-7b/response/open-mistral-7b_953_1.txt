To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the initial population distribution and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

The population distribution is 85% female and 15% male. However, the witness's reliability is only 80% in correctly identifying gender. This means that for every 100 people the witness encounters, they will correctly identify 80 as their gender and incorrectly identify 20 as the opposite gender.

The witness reported that the attacker is male. Given this information, we can assume that the witness identified a male person as such. However, we must account for the possibility that the witness made an error in their gender identification.

The probability that the witness made an error in this instance is equal to the proportion of times the witness errs in their gender identification, which is 20%.

So, the probability that the attacker is actually female and the witness made an error is 0.2 (the probability of error).

However, we can't simply subtract this probability from 1, because the witness's report that the attacker is male also includes the possibility that the attacker is actually male and the witness correctly identified him/her.

To account for this, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identified him/her. This probability is equal to the proportion of times the witness correctly identifies gender, which is 0.8.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker plus the probability that the witness erroneously identified a female attacker as male, multiplied by the probability that the attacker is actually female.

This can be calculated as: 0.8 (probability of correct identification) + 0.2 (probability of error) * 0.15 (probability of attacker being male in the population)

Calculating this, we get: 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.83, or 83%.
