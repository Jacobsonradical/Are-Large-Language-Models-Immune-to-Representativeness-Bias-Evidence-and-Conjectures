To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. From information provided in point "a", we know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. From point "b", we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a person who is actually female, they will mistakenly identify that person as male 20% of the time. Similarly, when the witness sees a person who is actually male, they will mistakenly identify that person as female 20% of the time.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is male based on the witness's report, we need to consider both the actual probability that the attacker is male and the probability that the witness would mistake a female for a male.

Let's assume that the actual probability that the attacker is male is P(male).

1. When the witness sees a male attacker, they will correctly identify him as male with probability 0.8 (from point b).
2. When the witness sees a female attacker, they will mistakenly identify her as male with probability 0.2 (from point b).

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability that the attacker is female is P(female) = 0.85.

So, the probability that the witness sees a female attacker and mistakenly identifies her as male is P(witness sees female and mistakes gender) = P(female) * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%)

Now we can calculate the probability that the witness identified a male attacker:

P(male | witness's report) = P(witness sees male and correctly identifies) + P(witness sees female and mistakes gender)

P(male | witness's report) = (P(male) * 0.8) + (P(female) * 0.2)

Since we don't have a specific value for P(male), we can't provide an exact probability. However, we can solve this equation for P(male):

P(male) = (P(male | witness's report) - P(female) * 0.2) / 0.8

Given the information provided, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker is male (P(male)) would be somewhere between 0.5 and the actual value, as the witness's report increases the likelihood of the attacker being male but does not guarantee it.
