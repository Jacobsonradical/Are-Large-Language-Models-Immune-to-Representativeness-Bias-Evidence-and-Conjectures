To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

In this case, the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male, and the prior probability is the actual proportion of males in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness mistakes a female for a male

We are given that P(M) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female), P(w|M) = 0.8, and P(w|F) = 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(M|w) = [P(w|M) * P(M)] / [P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the numbers:

P(M|w) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

P(M|w) â‰ˆ 0.26

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 26%.
