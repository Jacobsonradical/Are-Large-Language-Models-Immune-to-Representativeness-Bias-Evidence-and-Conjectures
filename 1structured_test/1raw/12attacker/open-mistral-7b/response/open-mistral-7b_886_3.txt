To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is male (H), and the evidence is the witness's identification (E).

Let P(H) be the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to find. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, given that the attacker is male. This probability is given as 0.8 in the problem statement. P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, given that the attacker is not male. This probability is given as 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (since the witness errs 20% of the time and the population is 85% female).

We also have the total probability of the witness identifying a male, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H), where P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker being female.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Substituting the known values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * P(H) / [(0.8) * P(H) + (0.03) * (1 - P(H))]

Since the total probability of the population being male and female should add up to 1, we have P(H) + (1 - P(H)) = 0.15. Solving for P(H), we get P(H) = 0.143.

Substituting this value back into the Bayes' theorem equation, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.143) / [(0.8) * (0.143) + (0.03) * (0.857)]

Performing the calculation, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.509

So, based on the given evidence, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.509 or 50.9%.
