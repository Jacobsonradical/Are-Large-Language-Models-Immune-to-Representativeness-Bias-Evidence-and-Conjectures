To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

From the information provided, we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time. Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being male as p, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as a male as q = 0.2 (from the information given).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as a male is 1 - q = 0.8. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification is:

P(male | identified as male) = P(attacker is male) * P(witness correctly identifies male) + P(attacker is female) * P(witness incorrectly identifies female as male)

= p * 0.8 + (1 - p) * 0.2

From the first piece of information, we know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, so p = 0.15.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification is:

P(male | identified as male) = 0.15 * 0.8 + (1 - 0.15) * 0.2
= 0.12 + 0.08
= 0.2

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.2 or 20%. This means that, given the witness's identification, there is a 20% chance that the attacker is male and an 80% chance that the attacker is female. However, we should remember that this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's gender identification accuracy is consistent with the given conditions, and it may not reflect the true gender of the attacker.
