To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and that 85% of the population is female, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male (Type I error) and a male as female (Type II error).

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being female as p and the probability of the attacker being male as 1-p. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is p * (1 - 0.8) = 0.05p. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is (1-p) * 0.2 = 0.2(1-p).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability we're interested in is the probability that the attacker is indeed male, given the witness's observation. This is the probability of a Type I error divided by the sum of Type I and Type II errors:

P(attacker is male | witness's observation) = P(Type I error) / (P(Type I error) + P(Type II error)) = 0.05p / (0.05p + 0.2(1-p))

However, without knowing the actual value of p, we cannot provide a specific number. This problem requires more information to make a definite estimation.

Therefore, the estimate in the requested format is: {probability: cannot be provided, as more information is required}
