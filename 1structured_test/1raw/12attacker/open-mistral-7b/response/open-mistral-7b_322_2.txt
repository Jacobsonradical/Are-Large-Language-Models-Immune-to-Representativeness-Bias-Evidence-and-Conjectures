To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a male attacker as female.

Let x be the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a male as female. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, it means that x represents the error rate for male identifications.

Since the gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of encountering a male in the city is 0.15. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is therefore 0.8 - x.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, we can set up the following equation:

0.2 = 0.15 * x

Solving for x, we get x = 0.4

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as male:

0.8 - 0.4 = 0.4

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.4 or 40%.
