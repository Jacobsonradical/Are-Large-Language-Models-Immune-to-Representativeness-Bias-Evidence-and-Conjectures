Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's accuracy and the city's gender distribution.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.
3. Since the witness could not see the attacker's face, we assume that their gender identification is based on other visual cues such as body shape or height.
4. However, without specific information on how these cues are distributed between males and females in the population, we cannot make an exact calculation.
5. Therefore, we can only make an approximate estimate by assuming that the witness's error rate is equally distributed between misidentifying males as females and females as males.
6. In this case, the witness would be incorrect 10% of the time for each gender (20% total error divided by 2).
7. Given that 15% of the population is male, the probability of the witness misidentifying a male as female is 0.15 * 0.10 = 0.015, or 1.5%.
8. Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, we can assume that the actual attacker was male 98.5% of the time (the remaining 100% minus the 1.5% misidentification probability).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.985}.
