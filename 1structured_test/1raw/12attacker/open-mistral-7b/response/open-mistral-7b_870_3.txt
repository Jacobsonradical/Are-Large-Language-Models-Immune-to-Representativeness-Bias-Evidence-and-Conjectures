Given the information provided, the population is 85% female and 15% male. However, we also have a witness who, despite having a lower than perfect accuracy in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M). The witness correctly identified the gender of the attacker 80% of the time, which means P(M) * 0.8 = 0.8 * 0.15 (given that the attacker is actually male). Solving for P(M), we get P(M) ≈ 0.12.

However, the witness also incorrectly identified the gender 20% of the time, which means P(M) * 0.2 = 0.2 * 0.85 (given that the attacker is actually female). Solving for P(M), we get P(M) ≈ 0.17.

Since we don't have enough information to determine which equation is more likely, we cannot provide a single probability estimate. Instead, we can say that based on the given information, the probability of the attacker being male is between 0.12 and 0.17.
