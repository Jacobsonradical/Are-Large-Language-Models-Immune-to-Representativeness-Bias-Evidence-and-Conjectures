Based on the information provided, the witness's error rate in identifying gender is 20%. However, the witness identified the attacker as male. This means there was a misidentification in 20% of the cases only when the actual gender was female. Since 85% of the population is female, we can infer that the attacker was most likely male if the witness misidentified the gender.

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's misidentification, can be calculated as the probability of the witness misidentifying a female as male (error rate for identifying females as males).

The probability of misidentifying a female as male is the error rate (20%) multiplied by the probability of the attacker being female (15%).

So, the probability that the attacker is female given the witness's misidentification is 1 - (error rate for identifying females as males * probability of the attacker being female) = 1 - (0.2 * 0.15) = 0.68

Since we are looking for the probability that the attacker is male, we can calculate it as 1 - the probability that the attacker is female given the witness's misidentification = 1 - 0.68 = 0.32

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
