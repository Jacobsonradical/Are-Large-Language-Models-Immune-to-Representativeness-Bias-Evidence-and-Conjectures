Given the information provided, there are two sources of probability to consider: the population demographics and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

1. The population demographics suggest that 15% of the city's population is male. However, this information is not directly relevant to the attacker's gender, as the victim could not see the attacker's gender.

2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is more relevant. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, but erred in 20% of the cases. However, the witness's error rate is based on a sample of people who are half female and half male. In this case, the witness misidentified a person's gender, and the court determined that the person was actually male. This suggests that the witness's error rate might be lower when it comes to misidentifying male individuals.

Without more specific information on how the witness's error rate applies to misidentifying males, it's difficult to provide a precise estimate. However, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, it seems reasonable to assume that the probability that the attacker is male is higher than 80%, the witness's overall correct identification rate. But without more information, we cannot provide a precise number between 0 and 1.

In summary, {probability: higher than 80%, but a precise number cannot be provided with the given information}
