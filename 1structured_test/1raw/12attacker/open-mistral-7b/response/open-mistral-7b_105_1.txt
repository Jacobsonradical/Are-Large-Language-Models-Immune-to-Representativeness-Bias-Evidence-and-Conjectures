Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have direct information about how this ability applies to the specific night in question. We also know that the city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that the witness's ability to judge gender is equally applicable to the night in question as it is in general. In this case, we can use the Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A) is the prior probability of A, P(B) is the prior probability of B, and P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A.

In our case, A is the attacker being male, B is the witness's identification, and P(A|B) is the probability we are interested in.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is given by the city's population statistics as 15%.

P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness's identification given that the attacker is male, which is 80% based on the witness's ability.

P(B) is the prior probability of the witness's identification, which is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (P(B|A) * P(A)) and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker (P(B|not A) * P(not A)). Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, and the city's population is 85% female, P(B|not A) is 85% * 0.2 = 17%.

Using these values, we can estimate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.2 + 0.15 * 0.85) = 0.1667 or approximately 16.67%

However, this assumption that the witness's ability to judge gender is equally applicable to the night in question as it is in general is a strong one. Without more specific information about the conditions under which the witness made the identification, it's difficult to provide a more accurate estimate. Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.1667, please provide a number between 0 and 1} but with a significant caveat that this estimate is based on an assumption that may not be valid.
