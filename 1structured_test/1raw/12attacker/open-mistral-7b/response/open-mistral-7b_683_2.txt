Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

From the first piece of information, we know that a witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male. However, we don't know the actual gender of the attacker yet.

From the second piece of information, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs in light of new evidence. In this case, our belief is that the attacker is male, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B is equal to the probability of the evidence given the event times the probability of the event divided by the probability of the evidence. In our case, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male.

The probability of the evidence given the event (P(B|A)) is equal to the witness's accuracy in identifying gender, which is 0.8. The probability of the event (P(A)) is equal to the proportion of males in the population, which is 0.15. The probability of the evidence (P(B)) is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the event and its complement (the probability that the attacker is female), which is 0.15 + 0.85 * 0 = 0.15.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.15
          = 0.8

However, this probability is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to identify gender is independent of the gender of the attacker. If the witness systematically underestimates the proportion of males, for example, this could lead to an overestimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

Therefore, the strict estimate in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.8, please note that this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to identify gender is independent of the gender of the attacker, and a more accurate estimate would require more information}
