To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that deals with conditional probabilities and is often used to update beliefs in light of new evidence.

In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male. The prior probability is the probability of the attacker being male in the population.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female (since the population is 85% female and 15% male, P(F) = 0.15)
- P(witness said male | M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker (given by the witness's ability: 0.8)
- P(witness said male | F) as the probability that the witness mistakes a female attacker for a male (the complement of P(witness said male | M): 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)

We want to find P(M | witness said male). According to Bayes' theorem, this is given by:

P(M | witness said male) = [P(witness said male | M) * P(M)] / [P(witness said male | M) * P(M) + P(witness said male | F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M | witness said male) = [0.8 * P(M)] / [0.8 * P(M) + 0.17 * P(F)]

To find P(M), we can use the given information that the population is 85% female and 15% male:

P(M) = 0.15

Now we can calculate P(M | witness said male):

P(M | witness said male) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.15]

P(M | witness said male) â‰ˆ 0.35

So, based on the witness's identification and the given population information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.35 or 35%.
