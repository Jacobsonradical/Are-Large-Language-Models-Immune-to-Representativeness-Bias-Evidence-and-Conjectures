Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a probability theory describing the relationship between prior knowledge and newly acquired data.

Let:
- A be the event that the attacker is male, and its probability is P(A)
- B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male, and its probability is P(B | A) (given that the attacker is male)
- C be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male, and its probability is P(B | ¬A) (given that the attacker is not male)

P(B) is the sum of the two probabilities above: P(B) = P(B | A)P(A) + P(B | ¬A)P(¬A)

Since we know the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:
- P(B | A) = 0.8
- P(B | ¬A) = 0.2

We also know that 85% of the population is female, so P(¬A) = 0.15, and P(A) = 1 - P(¬A) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.68

Since P(B) is the sum of the product of the probabilities, we can rearrange Bayes' theorem to find P(A):
P(A | B) = P(B | A)P(A) / P(B)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.68, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
