To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as P_w_m and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as P_w_f (where P_w_f = 1 - P_w_m).

Given that 80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies a person's gender, we can infer that P_w_m = 0.8. Similarly, the witness errs 20% of the time, so P_w_f = 0.2.

Now we know that 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male. The witness identifies the attacker as male. The probability of this event occurring if the attacker is female is P_w_f * 0.15 (since the witness errs in identifying a female as male 20% of the time).

The probability of this event occurring if the attacker is male is 1 - P_w_f * 0.15 (since the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time).

Since we don't have any additional information about the actual gender of the attacker, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male by considering both cases:

P(attacker is male) = P(witness correctly identifies male attacker) + P(witness incorrectly identifies female attacker as male)

P(witness correctly identifies male attacker) = P(attacker is male) * (1 - P_w_f)
P(witness incorrectly identifies female attacker as male) = P(attacker is female) * P_w_f

Solving the system of equations, we get:

P(attacker is male) = (P(witness correctly identifies male attacker) - P(attacker is female) * P_w_f) / (P(witness correctly identifies male attacker) + P(attacker is female) * P_w_f)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(attacker is male) = ((0.15 * (1 - 0.2)) - (0.85 * 0.2)) / ((0.15 * (1 - 0.2)) + (0.85 * 0.2))

P(attacker is male) = 0.125 / 0.25

So the probability that the attacker is male is 0.5 or 50%.
