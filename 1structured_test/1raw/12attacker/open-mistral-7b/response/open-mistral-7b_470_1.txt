Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's gender is randomly distributed among the population, we can use the witness's error rate as an estimate of the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's gender.

The error rate is 20%, which means that the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time. Since there are two genders, we can assume that the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

However, the witness identified the attacker as male. Since the witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, this suggests that the witness's identification is likely correct. Therefore, we can adjust our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male based on the witness's accuracy.

If we assume that the witness's identification is always correct, the probability that the attacker is male is 1. However, since we cannot assume that the witness is always correct, we should use a more conservative estimate.

Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.

Therefore, our final estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.8, please provide a number between 0 and 1}. This estimate takes into account the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city, as well as the fact that the witness identified the attacker as male.
