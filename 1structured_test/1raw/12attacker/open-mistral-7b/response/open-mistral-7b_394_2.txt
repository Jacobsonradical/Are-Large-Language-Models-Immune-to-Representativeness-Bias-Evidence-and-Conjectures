To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

From the information provided, we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Also, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the gender
- P(err) as the probability that the witness errs in identifying the gender

We know that P(M) + P(F) = 1 (since the attacker must be either male or female)

The probability that the witness correctly identifies the gender of a male attacker is P(M) * P(correct)
The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male attacker as female is P(M) * P(err)

Similarly, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a female attacker is P(F) * P(correct)
The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male is P(F) * P(err)

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write an equation:
P(M) * P(correct) + P(M) * P(err) = 1 (the witness's statement)

We also know that the probability of a female being mistaken for a male is equal to the probability of a male being mistaken for a female because the witness's error rate is the same for both genders. This means that P(err) = P(F) * P(err | F) = P(M) * P(err | M)

Substituting P(err) in the equation, we get:
P(M) * P(correct) + P(M) * P(M) * P(err | M) = 1

Since we know that P(M) * P(err | M) = P(F) * P(err | F), we can rewrite the equation as:
P(M) * P(correct) + P(M) * P(M) * P(F) * P(err | F) = 1

We know that P(F) = 0.15 and P(err | F) = P(M) * P(err | M) = 0.2, so we can solve for P(M) by substituting these values into the equation:

P(M) = (1 - 0.8 * 0.15)/(0.8 * 0.15 + 0.15 * 0.8 * 0.2) = 0.319

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.319 or 31.9%.
