Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population distribution and the witness's identification.

1. From the population distribution (information "a"), we know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male. This means that if the attacker was randomly chosen from the population, they would be male with a probability of 15%.

2. However, we also have information "b" about a witness who was able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness saw the attacker clearly enough to make a reliable judgment, then the witness's identification of the attacker as male increases the probability that the attacker is indeed male.

To calculate this increased probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of an event A given evidence B can be calculated as P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

In this case, event A is the attacker being male, and evidence B is the witness's identification of the attacker as male. We know P(A) from the population distribution (15%) and P(B|A) from the witness's ability to correctly identify gender (80%). We don't have direct information about P(A|B) or P(B), but we can make reasonable assumptions based on the information given.

Assuming that the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is independent of the attacker's gender, we can infer that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B|≠A) = 0.2 (where ≠A represents not male, which includes female and other genders not specified in the information).

We also assume that the witness's ability to make a reliable judgement is high enough that P(B|A) ≈ P(B|B) and P(B|≠A) ≈ P(B|≠B). This means that the witness's identification of a male as male is just as likely as their identification of a male as male, and their identification of a non-male as non-male is just as likely as their identification of a non-male as non-male.

Given these assumptions, we can calculate P(B) as the average of P(B|A) and P(B|≠A): P(B) = 0.5 * (P(B|A) + P(B|≠A)) = 0.5 * (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.6.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate P(A|B) as follows: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.6 ≈ 0.167.

So, based on both the population distribution and the witness's identification, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 16.7%. However, it's important to note that this estimate relies on several assumptions and potential biases in the witness's identification ability. A more accurate estimate would require further information or a more sophisticated analysis.
