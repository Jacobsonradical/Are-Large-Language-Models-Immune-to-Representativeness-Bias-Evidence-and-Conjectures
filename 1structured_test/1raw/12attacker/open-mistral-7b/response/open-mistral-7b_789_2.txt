To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness was found to correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

Given these facts, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker as male (true positive) and a female attacker as male (false positive).

Let's denote the probability of a male attacker as P(male) = 0.15 and the probability of a female attacker as P(female) = 0.85.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as male is:
P(witness correctly identifies male | male attacker) = 0.8

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male (a false positive) is:
P(witness incorrectly identifies female | female attacker) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness saying "male" given that the attacker is actually male:

P(witness says "male") = P(witness correctly identifies male | male attacker) * P(male attacker)
                                  + P(witness incorrectly identifies female | female attacker) * P(female attacker)

P(witness says "male") = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.182

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and gender distribution in the city, is approximately 0.182 or 18.2%.
