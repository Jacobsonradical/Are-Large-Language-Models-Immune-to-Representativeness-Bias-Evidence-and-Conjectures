To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness's error rate.

The population distribution is 85% female and 15% male. However, the witness's statement suggests that they are not perfectly accurate in determining gender, and they mistakenly identify people as male 20% of the time when they are actually female.

Since we don't know if the witness's error was in this case, we should consider both possibilities: the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, and the witness made an error and misidentified a female as male.

If the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, then the attacker is indeed male with a probability of 15% (as per the population distribution).

On the other hand, if the witness made an error, then they mistakenly identified a female as male. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the probability of this happening is 0.20.

However, since 85% of the population is female, the probability of picking a female at random is 0.85. So, the probability of the witness making an error and misidentifying a female as male is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement is the sum of the two possibilities:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.32 or 32%.
