Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

However, there's an inconsistency in the information. The witness's accuracy rate is based on a 50-50 gender split, but in reality, the city's population is not 50-50. This makes it difficult to directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to the actual population.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem is particularly useful when we have prior knowledge (like the city's gender distribution) and new evidence (like the witness's identification).

However, without the ability to directly apply the witness's accuracy rate, I'm unable to provide a strictly numerical estimate using Bayes' theorem. It would require additional information or assumptions to make such a calculation.

In conclusion, I cannot provide a definitive probability estimate based on the given information. It would be best to consult with experts in probability theory or statistics for a more accurate answer.
