To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- p: probability that the attacker is male
- q: probability that the attacker is female (1 - p)
- TP: true positive (witness correctly identifies male attacker)
- FP: false positive (witness incorrectly identifies male when attacker is female)
- TN: true negative (witness correctly identifies female attacker)
- FN: false negative (witness incorrectly identifies female when attacker is male)

Given the witness's ability to judge gender, we know that TP = 0.8p and FP = 0.2q. Since there are equal numbers of males and females, we can assume that q = 0.5.

The probability of a false positive (witness makes a mistake) is given by the product of the true probability of the attacker being female and the witness's error rate for identifying a female as male:

FP = 0.5 * 0.2

Now, we can use the Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

p = (TP / (TP + FP)) * (number of males in the population / total population)
p = (0.8p / (0.8p + 0.2 * 0.5)) * (0.15 / 0.85 + 0.5 * 0.15)

Solving this equation numerically, we find that p â‰ˆ 0.21, or 21%.
