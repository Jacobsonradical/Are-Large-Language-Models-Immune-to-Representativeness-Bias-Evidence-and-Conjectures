Given the two pieces of information, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The population distribution of males and females in the city. From the information provided, we know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.

2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, there's an important distinction to make between the population distribution and the witness's observations. The witness's observations are biased by their error rate, and we don't know whether the witness saw the attacker correctly or made an error.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can calculate the probability that the witness was correct, but this probability is not the same as the probability that the attacker is male in the population.

Unfortunately, without additional information, we cannot accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is male in the population based on the witness's identification and the population distribution. The witness's error rate introduces too much uncertainty.

Therefore, I cannot provide a number between 0 and 1 as the estimate for the probability that the attacker is male.
