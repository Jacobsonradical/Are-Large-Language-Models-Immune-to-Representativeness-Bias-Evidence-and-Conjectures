To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know whether the witness's error was misidentifying a male as female or vice versa, let's assume that the error rate is evenly distributed between the two genders. This means that the witness mistakes a male for a female 10% of the time and a female for a male 10% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given the gender distribution in the city. Since 85% of the population is female, the remaining 15% must be male.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8 or 80%. However, since there are more females than males in the city, the witness is more likely to encounter a female during their daily activities and therefore has a higher chance of mistaking a female for a male.

Let P(m) be the probability that the attacker is male. The probability of the witness identifying a male (P(w|m)) can be calculated as follows:

P(w|m) = P(w and m) / P(m)

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male (P(w and m)) is 0.8 (80%). The probability of the attacker being male (P(m)) is our target value.

To find P(m), we can rearrange the equation:

P(m) = P(w and m) / P(w|m)

We know P(w and m) = 0.8 and P(w|m) from the witness's ability to identify gender. However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(m). We can estimate P(m) by assuming that the witness's mistake rate is evenly distributed between the two genders.

Given this assumption, the probability of the witness mistaking a female for a male (P(w|f)) is also 0.1 (10%). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a female (P(w and f)) is 0.9 or 90%.

The probability of the attacker being female (P(f)) is 1 - P(m) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

The probability of the witness identifying a female (P(w)) is the sum of the probabilities of correct identification and mistake:

P(w) = P(w and f) + P(w and not f)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(w) = 0.9 * 0.85 + 0.1 * 0.15 = 0.765

Now, we can calculate P(m) using the equation for P(w|m):

P(m) = P(w and m) / P(w|m) = 0.8 / 0.765 â‰ˆ 0.1048

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 10.48%. However, this estimate assumes that the witness's mistake rate is evenly distributed between the two genders, which may not be the case in reality. Therefore, this estimate should be interpreted with caution.
