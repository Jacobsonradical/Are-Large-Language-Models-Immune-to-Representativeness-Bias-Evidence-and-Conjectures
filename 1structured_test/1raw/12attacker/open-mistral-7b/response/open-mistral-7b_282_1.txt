To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the expected number of correct gender identifications for the witness. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we would expect them to correctly identify a female as such 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68 times and a male as such 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 times, for a total of 0.68 + 0.12 = 0.80 expected correct identifications.

However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as male. This means that the actual number of correct identifications is one more than our expectation. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness making one additional correct identification beyond their expected number.

Since there are two genders and the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability of making one additional correct identification is the probability of getting two heads in three coin flips, where a head represents a correct identification and a tail represents an error. This can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:

P(2 heads in 3 flips) = C(3, 2) * (0.8)^2 * (0.2)^1 = 0.064

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.064. However, this probability assumes that the witness's gender identification ability is independent and identical in this specific case and in their sample where they had a 80% accuracy. If there are reasons to believe that the witness's ability to judge gender was affected by the specific conditions of the night, this probability may be less reliable.
