To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the population.

1. The witness has an 80% success rate in identifying gender and a 20% error rate.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Let's assume that the gender distribution of the people the witness saw is similar to the city's population distribution (85% female and 15% male). Since the witness properly identified gender 80% of the time, we can calculate the expected number of times the witness correctly identified a male attacker:

Expected number of correct male identifications = Probability of female in population * Error rate of gender identification + Probability of male in population * Success rate of gender identification
                                                              = 0.85 * 0.20 + 0.15 * 0.80
                                                              = 0.17 + 0.12
                                                              = 0.29

The witness incorrectly identified a male as female 20% of the time. Since the witness mistakenly identified a female attacker as male, we can calculate the expected number of times the witness mistakenly identified a male as female:

Expected number of incorrect male identifications = Probability of female in population * Success rate of gender identification + Probability of male in population * Error rate of gender identification
                                                                      = 0.85 * 0.80 + 0.15 * 0.20
                                                                      = 0.68 + 0.03
                                                                      = 0.71

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the actual number of correct male identifications is 1. We can now calculate the probability that the attacker is male:

Probability of attacker being male = Actual number of correct male identifications / Expected number of correct male identifications
                                                   = 1 / 0.29
                                                   â‰ˆ 0.345

The estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
