To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability.

1. We know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. However, the witness made an error in this case, identifying the attacker as male.

Since the witness is wrong more often than they are right (20% vs. 80%), it's more likely that they made an error in this case as well, especially given that they saw the attacker under less than ideal conditions.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being male as p. The witness's statement that the attacker is male can be seen as an error, which happens with probability 0.2.

Given that the population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 = p.

The probability of the witness making an error, given that the attacker is male, is 0.2. This means that the probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness made an error, is the probability of the witness making an error divided by the probability of the attacker being male: p = 0.2 / 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.1333

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.1333 or 13.33%. This estimate is lower than the population percentage of males due to the witness's error.
