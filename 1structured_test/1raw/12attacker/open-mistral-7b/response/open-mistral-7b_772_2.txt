To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being male, and the new evidence is the witness's statement that the attacker appears to be male.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break it down:

1. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male. Since we don't have this information, we can use the city's gender distribution as an approximation. From the second piece of information, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, so the probability of the attacker being male is 15%.

2. P(E|H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male if the attacker is indeed male. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the attacker is male, we're interested in the true positive rate, which is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker. This is 0.8 (or 80%).

3. P(E|~H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male if the attacker is female. Since the attacker is female, we're interested in the false positive rate, which is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male. This is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (or 3%).

4. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender. This is the sum of the true positive rate and the false positive rate, which is 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83 (or 83%).

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.83 â‰ˆ 0.144

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 14.4%.
