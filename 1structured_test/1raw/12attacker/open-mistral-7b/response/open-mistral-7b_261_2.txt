Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the attacker being male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is proportional to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A.

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

The prior probability of the attacker being male (P(A)) is not given, but we can infer it from the population statistics provided in the second piece of information: P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that he/she is male (P(B|A)) is given in the first piece of information: P(B|A) = 0.8.

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that he/she is female (P(B|~A)) is 0.2, since the witness is wrong in 20% of the cases.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the values: P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating the numerator and denominator: P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.1]

Simplifying: P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.22 = 0.545

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.545 or 54.5%.
