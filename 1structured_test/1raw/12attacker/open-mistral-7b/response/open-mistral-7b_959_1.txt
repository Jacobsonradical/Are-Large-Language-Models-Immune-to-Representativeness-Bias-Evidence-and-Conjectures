To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know whether the witness's error was misidentifying a male as female or a female as male, we'll assume that these two types of errors are equally likely (which is a reasonable assumption given that gender is not binary in a strict sense, but for simplicity, we'll work with this assumption).

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can assume that the witness's statement "the attacker is male" is more likely an error than a correct identification, because the probability of a male attacker is lower than the overall male population percentage.

However, we also know that the witness's error rate is 20%. So, the probability that the witness's statement "the attacker is male" is a correct identification is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80, or 80%.

But since the actual probability of a male attacker is lower than the overall male population percentage, we need to adjust the 80% probability obtained from the witness's reliability to account for this.

To do this, we can multiply the 80% probability obtained from the witness's reliability by the actual probability of a male attacker (which is 15%).

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%.
