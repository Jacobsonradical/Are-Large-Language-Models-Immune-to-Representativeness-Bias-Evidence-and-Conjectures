To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to calculate the probability of an event A given some evidence B. In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying anyone as male.

We are given that:
- 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male. So, P(A) = 0.15.
- The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errors in 20% of the cases. So, P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(not B|A) = 0.2.
- Half of the people in the sample are female and half are male. So, we can assume that P(B|not A) = P(B|A) = 0.8.
- P(not B|not A) = 1 - P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.68
P(B) = 0.8

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / 0.8
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.8
P(A|B) = 0.15

So, given the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 15%. This means that there is a 15% chance that the attacker is a male, and an 85% chance that the attacker is a female.
