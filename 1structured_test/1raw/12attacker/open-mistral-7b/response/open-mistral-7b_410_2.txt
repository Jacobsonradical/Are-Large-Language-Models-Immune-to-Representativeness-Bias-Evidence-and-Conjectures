To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the attacker's gender is unknown, we can't be certain that the witness was correct or incorrect in this specific case. However, we can use the witness's performance as a probability distribution.

Let's denote:
- p: the probability that the attacker is male
- q: the probability that the attacker is female (1-p)

The witness identifies a male as male with probability p, and a female as male with probability q*0.2 (erring 20% of the time). The witness identifies a male as female with probability (1-p)*0.2 (erring 20% of the time), and a female as female with probability (1-q).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we have the equation:

0.8p + 0.2q = 1

We also know that 85% of the population is female, so q = 0.15. Solving the equation for p, we get:

p = (1 - 0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2 = 0.6

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.6} or 60%.
