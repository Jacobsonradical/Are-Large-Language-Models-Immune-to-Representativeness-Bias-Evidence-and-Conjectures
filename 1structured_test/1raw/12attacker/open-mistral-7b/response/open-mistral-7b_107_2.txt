To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given this information, we can calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's gender as male, even if the attacker was indeed female. This will give us the probability that the attacker is actually female.

Probability of witness error (given female attacker) = 0.20 (error rate)

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this means that the witness's error must have occurred. So, the probability that the attacker is female is the probability of witness error.

Now, to find the probability that the attacker is male, we subtract the probability that the attacker is female:

Probability of attacker being male = 1 - Probability of attacker being female
                                             = 1 - 0.20
                                             = 0.80

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.80 or 80%.
