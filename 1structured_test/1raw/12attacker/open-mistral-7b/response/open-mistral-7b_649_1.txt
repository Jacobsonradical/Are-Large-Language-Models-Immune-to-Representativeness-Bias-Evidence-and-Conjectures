To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of an error given that the attacker is indeed male.

If 15% of the population is male, then the probability of picking a male from the population at random is 0.15. The witness will correctly identify a male 80% of the time, so the probability of a correct identification is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).

However, we also need to account for the cases where the witness errs and incorrectly identifies a female as male. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of picking a female at random is 0.85. The witness will mistakenly identify a female as male 20% of the time, so the probability of an error is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Since we know that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that this identification is correct is the probability of a correct identification plus the probability of an error. So the total probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (or 29%).

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.29}.
