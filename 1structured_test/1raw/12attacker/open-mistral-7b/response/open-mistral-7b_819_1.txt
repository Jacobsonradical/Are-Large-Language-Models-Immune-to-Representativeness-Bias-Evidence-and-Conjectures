Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is relatively accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male with confidence. However, we don't know the actual gender of the attacker yet.

The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. This means that in 80% of the cases, the witness correctly identifies the gender, and in 20% of the cases, the witness errs.

Given that we don't have any information about the attacker's gender, the probabilities for them being male or female are equal, as the population is 85% female and 15% male. In other words, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.15, and the probability of the attacker being male is 0.85 (since probabilities must sum to 1).

Now, when the witness identifies the attacker as male, it could be a correct identification (given that the attacker is indeed male) or an error (given that the attacker is actually female).

The probability of a correct identification is 0.8 (since the witness is 80% accurate in gender identification). The probability of an error is 0.2 (since the witness is 20% inaccurate).

Given that the attacker's gender is unknown, the probability of the witness's identification being correct is the sum of the probabilities of both correct identification and error, weighted by the actual gender proportions in the population:

Probability of correct identification = 0.8 * 0.15 (since the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15) + 0 (since there's no error in correct identification) = 0.12

However, we've made a mistake in our reasoning. We've assumed that the probability of a correct identification is equal to the probability of the witness's identification being correct. This is not true since the witness's identification could be an error.

Instead, the probability of the witness's identification being correct is equal to the probability of a correct identification by the witness, given that the attacker is actually male. This probability is 0.8 (since the witness is 80% accurate in gender identification).

The probability of the witness's identification being incorrect is then the probability of a correct identification by the witness, given that the attacker is actually female. This probability is 0 (since the witness is always incorrect in gender identification in this case).

Now we can compute the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification:

Probability of attacker being male given witness's identification = Probability of correct identification / (Probability of correct identification + Probability of incorrect identification)

Probability of correct identification = 0.8 * 0.15
Probability of incorrect identification = 0

Probability of attacker being male given witness's identification = 0.12 / 0.12 = 1

However, this result is not reasonable since probabilities should be between 0 and 1. We've made an error in our reasoning, and the actual probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification is likely to be lower than 1.

Unfortunately, with the given information, it's impossible to provide a precise estimate of the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification. We would need more information, such as the base rate fallacy (the prior probability of the attacker being male) or the likelihood ratio (the ratio of the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is male to the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is female).

So, the answer to your question is: {probability: Unable to provide a precise estimate, please consult further information}
