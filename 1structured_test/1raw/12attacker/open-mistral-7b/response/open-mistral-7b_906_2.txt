To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: According to the information provided, 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since we don't have any information about the gender of the majority of people the witness saw, we cannot directly use the population distribution to make an estimate. However, we can use the witness's accuracy to adjust the population distribution.

If the witness saw a person from the city, there's an 85% chance that person is female and a 15% chance that the person is male. But given the witness's accuracy, we need to adjust these probabilities to account for the fact that the witness might have mistakenly identified a female as male or a male as female.

Let x be the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male. Then the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a female as male is 1 - x.

The probability that the witness saw a male and correctly identified him is x * 0.15.

Given that the witness saw a male and correctly identified him, the probability that the attacker is actually male is this probability divided by the probability that the witness saw a male and correctly identified him: x * 0.15 / x = 0.15

The probability that the witness saw a female and mistakenly identified her as male is (1 - x) * 0.85.

Given that the witness saw a female and mistakenly identified her as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is this probability divided by the probability that the witness saw a female and mistakenly identified her as male: (1 - x) * 0.85 / (1 - x) = 0.85

Since the witness said the attacker was male, we should consider both of these probabilities and weigh them based on their likelihood. The probability that the witness saw a female and mistakenly identified her as male is less likely given the witness's accuracy, so we should give more weight to the first probability.

The final estimate is the probability that the witness saw a male and correctly identified him divided by the sum of the probabilities that the witness saw a male and correctly identified him and the probability that the witness saw a female and mistakenly identified her as male: x * 0.15 / (x * 0.15 + (1 - x) * 0.85)

Since we don't have a specific value for x, we cannot provide a numerical estimate. However, given that the witness's accuracy is higher for identifying males, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is likely to be greater than 0.15 but less than 0.85.
