This is a probability problem that involves Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- A: the attacker is male
- ~A: the attacker is not male (i.e., the attacker is female)
- E: the witness identifies the attacker as male

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male if the attacker is male (P(E|A)) is given as 0.8 (80%).
The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male if the attacker is not male (P(E|~A)) is given as 0.2 (20%).

The probability of the attacker being male (P(A)) is given as 0.15 (15% of the city's population is male).
The probability of the attacker not being male (P(~A)) is therefore 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given values:
P(A|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this, we find that P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.207 or 20.7%.

Therefore, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 20.7%.
