To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errors 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness erring (misidentifying the gender) as follows:

1. The witness errs 20% of the time, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying the gender is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

1. The probability of the attacker being male is 0.15, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male is 0.80.
2. The probability of the witness erring and misidentifying the attacker as male is 0.20.
3. Since we don't know whether the witness erred or not, we can't directly use the probabilities calculated above. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement:

P(Attacker is male | Witness statement) = [P(Witness statement | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male)] / [P(Witness statement | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness statement | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female)]

1. Plugging in the values, we get:
   P(Attacker is male | Witness statement) = [(0.80) * (0.15)] / [(0.80) * (0.15) + (0.20) * (0.85)]

After calculating, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement is approximately 0.25.
