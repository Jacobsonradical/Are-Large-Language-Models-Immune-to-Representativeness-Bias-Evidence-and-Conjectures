To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80% (correctly identifying male 80% of the time), and the error rate is 20% (misidentifying gender 20% of the time).

2. In the city, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The witness identified the attacker as male. If the attacker was indeed male, the witness would be correct 80% of the time. The probability of this happening is 0.15 (the proportion of males in the city).

However, there's a chance that the witness made an error and misidentified a female as male. The probability of this happening is 0.85 (the proportion of females in the city) times the error rate of 0.20.

So, the probability that the witness misidentified a female as male is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17.

The total probability of the witness's statement being true (either because the attacker is male or because the witness made an error) is the sum of the two probabilities:

0.15 (probability of a male attacker) + 0.17 (probability of a female attacker misidentified as male) = 0.32

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is the same for both genders. If the error rate is higher for identifying females as males, then the actual probability of a male attacker might be higher. But without that information, we can only provide an estimate based on the given data.
