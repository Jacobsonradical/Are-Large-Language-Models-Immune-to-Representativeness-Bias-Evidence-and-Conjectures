To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and is used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's define our variables:
- H: The attacker is male
- ~H: The attacker is not male (i.e., the attacker is female)
- E: The witness identified the attacker as male

We know the following probabilities:
p(H) = Probability that the attacker is male = Unknown
p(~H) = Probability that the attacker is not male (female) = 1 - p(H)
p(E|H) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male = 0.8
p(E|~H) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male = 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement:

p(H|E) = [p(E|H) * p(H)] / [p(E|H) * p(H) + p(E|~H) * p(~H)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

p(H|E) = [0.8 * p(H)] / [0.8 * p(H) + 0.2 * (1 - p(H))]

Unfortunately, we don't have a value for p(H) in this problem. However, we can rearrange the equation to solve for p(H):

p(H) = [p(H|E) * p(E|H) * (1 - p(H))] / [p(E|~H) * p(~H)]

Using the given information about the population in the city, we can calculate p(~H) as 0.15 (15%). The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's gender is given as 80%, so p(E|H) = 0.8. However, we don't have a direct value for p(E|~H), but we can use the relationship p(E|H) + p(E|~H) = 1. Since p(E|H) = 0.8, p(E|~H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now we can calculate p(H):

p(H) = [p(H|E) * p(E|H) * (1 - p(H))] / [p(E|~H) * p(~H)]
= [p(H|E) * 0.8 * (0.15)] / [0.2 * 0.15]

Since we don't have a value for p(H|E), we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the probability that the attacker is male. However, we can express the probability as a function of p(H|E):

p(H) = [p(H|E) * 0.12] / 0.03

To find the actual probability, you would need to know the value of p(H|E), which depends on the specific circumstances and the witness's ability to identify gender.
