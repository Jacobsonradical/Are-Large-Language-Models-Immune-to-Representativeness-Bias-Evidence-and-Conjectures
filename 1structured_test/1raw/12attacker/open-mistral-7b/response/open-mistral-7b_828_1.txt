To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided about the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- p as the probability that the attacker is male
- q as the probability that the attacker is female
- w as the witness's accuracy in identifying gender

Given that the witness's accuracy is 80% (w = 0.8), we know that they correctly identify the gender in 0.8p cases when the attacker is male and in 0.8q cases when the attacker is female.

The witness also errs in 20% of the cases (w = 0.2), which means they misidentify the gender in 0.2p cases when the attacker is male and in 0.2q cases when the attacker is female.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write an equation based on the probabilities of their correct and incorrect identifications:

0.8p + 0.2q = 1

We also know that the population is 85% female (q = 0.85) and 15% male (p = 0.15).

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 1

Solving for p, we find that the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.15 or 15%.

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
