Given the information provided, we can make an estimation of the probability that the attacker is male.

From the first piece of information, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness misidentified the attacker as male. This means that if the actual gender of the attacker was female, the witness would have mistakenly identified the attacker as male.

From the second piece of information, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. If the attacker is female, the probability of the witness mistaking her for a male would be 15% (the probability of choosing a male from the population).

The probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is male is 20%. Since the witness did make a mistake, it's more likely that they misidentified a female as male than a male.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is female, which is 15%.
