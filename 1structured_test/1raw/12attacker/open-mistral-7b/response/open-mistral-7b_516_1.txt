Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population statistics and the witness's testimony.

1. From the population statistics, we know that 15% of the city's population is male.
2. The witness, however, identified the attacker as male with a 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being male) given evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is male
- E1 as the event that the population statistics indicate a 15% male population
- E2 as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|E1 ∩ E2), the probability that the attacker is male given both pieces of evidence.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|E1 ∩ E2) = [P(E2|A) * P(A)] / [P(E2)]

In this case, we know the following probabilities:

- P(A) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)
- P(E2|A) = 0.8 (the witness's success rate in identifying male attackers)
- P(E1 ∩ E2) = P(E1) * P(E2|A) (because the witness's ability to identify gender is independent of the population statistics)
- P(E1) = 0.85 (from the population statistics)
- P(E2) = P(E1) * P(E2|A) + P(E1) * P(E2|not A) = 0.85 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.85 (since we don't have information about the witness's error rate in identifying female attackers)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|E1 ∩ E2) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.85 ≈ 0.12

So, given the population statistics and the witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 12%.
