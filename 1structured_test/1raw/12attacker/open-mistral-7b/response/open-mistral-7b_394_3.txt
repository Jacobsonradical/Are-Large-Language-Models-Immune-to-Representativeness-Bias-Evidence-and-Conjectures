Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A divided by the probability of B.

Let's define our events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

The prior probability of A (P(A)) is not given, so we need to make an assumption or use some other data. Let's assume that the prior probability of A is equal to the population percentage of males, which is 15% (0.15).

The probability of B given A (P(B|A)) is given as 80%, and the probability of B given not A (P(B|not A)) is given as 20%.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of A given B as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B) is the probability of the witness making a gender identification, which is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A). So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.15 = 0.8

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8, or 80%.
