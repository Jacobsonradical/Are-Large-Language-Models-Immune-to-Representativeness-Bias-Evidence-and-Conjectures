Given the information provided, the population is 85% female and 15% male. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as male with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Since the witness's accuracy is based on a 50-50 gender split, we can assume that their errors are equally distributed between misidentifying males as females and females as males. In other words, the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time.

If the witness said the attacker was male, there are two possibilities:
1. The witness correctly identified a male attacker.
2. The witness mistakenly identified a female attacker as male.

The probability of the first scenario is simply the proportion of males in the population, which is 0.15.

The probability of the second scenario is the witness's error rate for identifying females as males, which is 0.2.

However, since the witness identified the attacker as male, the second scenario is not relevant to our question. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the first scenario: 0.15 (probability of a male attacker given the population statistics) = {probability: 0.15}
