To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the city's gender distribution and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. City's gender distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. Witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male. This means that when the witness was wrong, they mistakenly identified a female as male. Since the city's gender distribution is 85% female, the probability that the witness was wrong due to mistakenly identifying a female is higher than the probability that they were wrong due to mistakenly identifying a male.

To account for this, let's first calculate the probability that the witness was wrong due to mistakenly identifying a female:

1. Probability of witness being wrong due to identifying a female: 20% (witness's error rate) * 85% (female population proportion) = 0.17 (or 17%)

Now, since the witness errs 20% of the time and identifies the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually female is 0.17. But since we know the attacker is not female (because the witness identified them as male), we can subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that the attacker is male:

1. Probability of attacker being male: 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%)

Therefore, based on the given information, it is estimated that the attacker is male with a probability of 83%.
