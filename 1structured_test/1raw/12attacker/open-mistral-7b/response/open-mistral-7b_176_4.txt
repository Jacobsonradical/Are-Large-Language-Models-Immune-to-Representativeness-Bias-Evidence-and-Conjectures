To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's abilities and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, we can assume that their incorrect identifications are equally distributed between gender misidentifications. This means they misidentify females as males 10% of the time and misidentify males as females 10% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the actual attacker is male is the probability that the witness correctly identified a male plus the probability that they falsely identified a female as male.

Probability of correctly identifying a male: 0.8 (80%)
Probability of misidentifying a female as a male: 0.1 (10%)

Now, we can compute the probability of the attacker being male:

{probability: 0.8 + 0.1 * (1 - 0.85) = 0.8 + 0.1 * 0.15 = 0.8 + 0.02 = 0.82}

So, our estimate is that the attacker is male with a probability of approximately 0.82.
