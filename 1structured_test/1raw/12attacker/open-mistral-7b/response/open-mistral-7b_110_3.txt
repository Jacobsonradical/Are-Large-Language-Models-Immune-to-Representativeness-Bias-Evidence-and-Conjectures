The given information suggests that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. However, a witness who is accurate 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time identified the attacker as male. This means that the witness's identification of the attacker as male is likely to be correct more often than not, even if the actual population ratio is skewed towards females.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way of updating our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being male) given new evidence (the witness's identification). The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we know is 15%.

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male. This is given as 80%.

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender. To calculate this, we need to consider both the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (P(B|A)) and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male (1 - P(B|not A)). Since we know the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) is 0.2.

The probability of the witness identifying a female attacker as male is the product of the probability of a female attacker and the probability of the witness erring, which is (1 - P(A)) * 0.2.

Therefore, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.06 = 0.18

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.18 â‰ˆ 0.56

So, given the witness's identification, our estimate is that there is a probability of approximately 56% that the attacker is male. This is higher than the prior probability of 15%, indicating that the witness's identification increases our belief that the attacker is male.
