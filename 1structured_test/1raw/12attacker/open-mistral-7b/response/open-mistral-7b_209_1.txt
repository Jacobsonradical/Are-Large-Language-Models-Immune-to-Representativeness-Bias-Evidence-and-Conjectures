To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is male
- ¬H: the attacker is not male (i.e., the attacker is female)
- E: the witness's statement (the attacker is identified as male)

From the given information, we know the following probabilities:

1. P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being male. Since we don't have enough information to calculate this value directly, we can use the information about the city's population as an approximation. Given that 85% of the population is female, we can deduce that 15% of the population is male. Therefore, P(H) ≈ 0.15.

2. P(¬H): the prior probability of the attacker being female. Since P(H) + P(¬H) = 1, P(¬H) ≈ 0.85.

3. P(E|H): the probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is male. This is given as 0.8 in the question.

4. P(E|¬H): the probability of the witness making an incorrect identification given that the attacker is female. Since the witness makes an incorrect identification in 20% of the cases, P(E|¬H) = 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being male:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H|E) ≈ 0.16

Therefore, based on the witness's statement and the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.16 or 16%.
