Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time.
2. The population is 85% female and 15% male.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a female attacker as male:
1. The probability of drawing a female from the population is 0.85 (given in the information).
2. The probability of the witness erring and identifying a female as male is 0.2 (given in the information).
3. So, the probability of both events happening together (drawing a female and erring) is the product of these two probabilities: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%)

Since we want to find the probability that the attacker is male, we subtract the probability of the witness erring and identifying a female as male from 100%:
1. Probability of attacker being male = 100% - 17% = 83%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.83}
