To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying male attackers)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of an attacker being male in the population)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (irrespective of the hypothesis)

Given that we don't have direct information about the probability of an attacker being male in the population (P(H)), we need to make an assumption or use some estimate based on the available information. In this case, we have the gender distribution in the city (85% female and 15% male), so we can use this as an approximation for P(H).

Now, we can calculate P(E | H) and P(E) from the given information:

- P(E | H) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying male attackers)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H) (total probability of the evidence)
  - P(E | ¬H) = 0.2 (witness's accuracy in identifying female attackers)
  - P(¬H) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being female in the population)

So, P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H | E) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / 0.29 ≈ 0.27

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the evidence, is approximately 0.27 or 27%.
