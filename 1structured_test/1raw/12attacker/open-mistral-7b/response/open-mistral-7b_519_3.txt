Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's gender and a 20% chance of making an error. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there is a 0.8 probability that they were correct in their identification. However, we also know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given some evidence E is P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E), where P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, and P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is male, E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male, P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15), P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (0.8), and P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying any attacker as male (which we can calculate using Bayes' theorem with the prior probability that the attacker is female and the witness's error rate).

P(E) = P(E|not H) * P(not H) + P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.17

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.17 â‰ˆ 0.76

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.76 or 76%.
