To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. Given that the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, let's calculate the expected number of times the witness should correctly identify a male:

Expected number of correct male identifications = Probability of a male * Witness's accuracy rate
                                                                       = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                                       = 0.12

However, due to the witness's errors, we also need to account for the times the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male. The probability of this happening is:

Expected number of false male identifications = Probability of a female * Witness's error rate
                                                                         = 0.85 * 0.2
                                                                         = 0.17

The total number of times the witness identifies someone as male is the sum of the expected number of correct and false identifications:

Total expected number of male identifications = Expected number of correct identifications + Expected number of false identifications
                                                                       = 0.12 + 0.17
                                                                       = 0.29

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can say that the probability of the attacker being male is equal to the ratio of the total expected number of male identifications to the total number of people in the city:

{probability: 0.29 / 1.0 = 0.29}

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
