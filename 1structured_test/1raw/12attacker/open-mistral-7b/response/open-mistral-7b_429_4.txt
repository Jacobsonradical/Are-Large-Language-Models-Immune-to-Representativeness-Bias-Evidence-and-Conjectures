To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

a) The attacker is actually male, and the witness correctly identified the gender.
b) The attacker is female, and the witness mistakenly identified the gender.

The probability of scenario a is the actual proportion of male attackers in the city multiplied by the witness's accuracy in identifying males. The probability of scenario b is the proportion of female attackers in the city multiplied by the witness's error rate in identifying females.

Let P(male) be the probability of the attacker being male, and P(err) be the probability of the witness erring. We have:

P(male) * P(correct) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (the probability of the attacker being male and the witness correctly identifying him)
P(female) * P(err) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (the probability of the attacker being female and the witness mistakenly identifying him)

Since the witness made a gender identification, the total probability of the two scenarios must equal 1:

0.12 + 0.17 = P(male) * 0.8 + P(female) * 0.2

Solving for P(male):

P(male) = (0.12 - 0.17) / (0.8 - 0.2) = 0.05 / 0.6 = 0.0833

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.0833 or 8.33%.
