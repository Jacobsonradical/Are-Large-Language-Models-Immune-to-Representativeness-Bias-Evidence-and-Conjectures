Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, a witness identified the attacker as male.
3. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is male:
P(Witness correct | Attacker is male) = Witness accuracy rate = 0.8

And the probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is female:
P(Witness correct | Attacker is female) = 1 - Witness error rate = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Since the victim could not see the attacker's gender, we can't directly use these probabilities. Instead, we need to calculate the probability of the witness making the correct identification (identifying the attacker as male) given only the population statistics.

Let P(Male) be the probability that the attacker is male and P(Female) be the probability that the attacker is female.

Then, according to Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification:

P(Witness correct) = P(Male) * P(Witness correct | Attacker is male) + P(Female) * P(Witness correct | Attacker is female)

P(Witness correct) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.64 + 0.68 = 1.32

However, the probability of a correct identification should be between 0 and 1. This means that the witness's statement is inconsistent with the population statistics. The witness's identification of the attacker as male is not likely to be correct, given the city's demographics.

In conclusion, based on the population statistics and the witness's ability to identify gender, it is unlikely that the attacker is male. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a specific probability estimate.
