Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the gender distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying genders.

1. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, the witness's identification of the attacker as male contradicts the 85% female population of the city. To account for this contradiction, we need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in their identification.

Given the witness's error rate of 20%, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female as male is 20%. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability that the attacker is female given the witness's identification is 1 - 20% = 0.8.

On the other hand, the probability that the witness correctly identified a male as male is 80%. Since 15% of the population is male, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

Since the witness's identification is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the attacker is male, we should use the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15, as our final estimate.

Therefore, your estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is: {probability: 0.15}
