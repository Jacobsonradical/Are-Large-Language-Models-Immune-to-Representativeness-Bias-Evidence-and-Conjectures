The given information can be broken down into two parts: the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. Population distribution: The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.
2. Witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

The witness mistakenly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, and a male as female 20% of the time (since the error rate is symmetrical). Therefore, the witness identifies a male as female only 10% of the time (half of the 20% error rate).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability that the witness correctly identified a male and not a false positive (a female mistakenly identified as male).

The probability of a false positive is 10% (as calculated above), and the probability of a true positive is the probability of selecting a male from the population, which is 15%.

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the true positive probability divided by the sum of the true and false positive probabilities:

{probability: 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.10) = 0.6}

The attacker's probability of being male is approximately 0.6 or 60%.
