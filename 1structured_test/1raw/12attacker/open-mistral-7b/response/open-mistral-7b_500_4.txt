To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the conflicting pieces of information provided.

1. According to the first piece of information, 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The second piece of information states that a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender correctly identified the attacker as male.

Since the witness's gender identification accuracy is independent of the city's gender distribution, we can assume that the witness's accuracy is the same for both genders. However, the witness's mistaken identification is more informative about the attacker's gender because it contradicts the city's gender distribution.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is male:

1. The probability of a random person being male in the city is 0.15.
2. The witness incorrectly identifies a male as female 20% of the time.
3. So, the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a male as female is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is female:

1. The probability of a random person being female in the city is 0.85.
2. The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time.
3. So, the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a female as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the probability of this event given that the attacker is male, which is 0.03, or 3%. However, the witness's incorrect identification is more likely to occur if the attacker is female because there are more females in the city, so we need to account for this bias.

We can calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female by dividing the probability of the witness making a mistake by the sum of the probabilities of the witness making a mistake for both genders:

1. The sum of the probabilities of the witness making a mistake for both genders is 0.03 + 0.17 = 0.20.
2. So, the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female is 0.03 / 0.20 = 0.15, or 15%.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, we can conclude that the probability that the attacker is female is 85%, and the probability that the attacker is male is 15%. However, since the witness's incorrect identification is more likely to occur if the attacker is female, we can say with more confidence that the attacker is female.

In summary, while the probability of the attacker being male is 15%, the conflicting information suggests that it is more likely that the attacker is female. Therefore, our estimated probability that the attacker is male is lower than the city's gender distribution, but we cannot provide a precise number between 0 and 1 because of the witness's bias.

{probability: less than 0.15, but more than 0, we cannot provide a precise number}
