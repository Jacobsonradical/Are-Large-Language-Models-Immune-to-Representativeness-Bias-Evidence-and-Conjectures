To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make some assumptions.

Assumption 1: The witness's gender judgment accuracy is independent of the actual gender of the attacker. This means that the 80% success rate and 20% error rate apply to both male and female attackers.

Assumption 2: The witness's observations of the attacker were not biased towards one gender. This means that the witness's errors are also evenly distributed between incorrectly identifying a male as female and a female as male.

Given these assumptions, we can calculate the probability that the witness identified the attacker as male by considering the witness's error rate. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the probability of being incorrect when the attacker is actually male is also 20%.

However, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. If the witness's error rate is evenly distributed, then more errors should occur when the witness is incorrectly identifying a female as male than the other way around (since female attacks are more common).

So, the actual probability of the witness's error when the attacker is male is likely higher than 20%. To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the prior probability of the attacker being male (15%) and the likelihood of the witness's error given that the attacker is male (the actual error rate, which is higher than 20%).

Unfortunately, we do not have enough information to calculate this exact probability. We would need more information about the distribution of errors for each gender to make a more accurate estimate.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot give a precise probability estimate, but I can say that the probability of the attacker being male is likely higher than 15% (the prior probability) but lower than 50% (since the witness identified the attacker as male).

{probability: a number between 15% and 50%, exact value cannot be determined with the given information}
