To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Given the information provided, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

1. Prior probability of the attacker being male: P(Male) = 15% = 0.15
2. Probability of the witness identifying a male as male: P(Male|Male_Identified) = 0.8 (from the given information)
3. Probability of the witness identifying a female as male: P(Female|Male_Identified) = 0.2 (from the given information)
4. Number of females in the population: N_F = 0.85 * total population = 0.85 * 100 = 85
5. Number of males in the population: N_M = 0.15 * total population = 0.15 * 100 = 15
6. Probability of the witness identifying a random person as male: P(Male_Identified) = P(Male|Male_Identified) * P(Male) + P(Female|Male_Identified) * P(Female)
   P(Male_Identified) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.164

Now we can calculate P(Male|Male_Identified) using Bayes' theorem:

P(Male|Male_Identified) = [P(Male_Identified|Male) * P(Male)] / P(Male_Identified)

Substituting the calculated values:

P(Male|Male_Identified) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.164 â‰ˆ 0.486

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 48.6%.
