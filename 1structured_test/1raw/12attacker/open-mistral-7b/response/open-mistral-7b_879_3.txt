Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. According to the first piece of information, the probability of an attacker being female is 0.85 (85%), and the probability of an attacker being male is 0.15 (15%).

2. However, we have a second piece of information that a witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying a person's gender, identified the attacker as male. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, this means that when the witness sees a person who is actually female, they will mistakenly identify that person as male 20% of the time.

3. In this case, we don't know the exact number of times the witness saw the attacker and identified them as male, but we do know that the witness was correct 80% of the time. This suggests that the number of times the witness saw a male and correctly identified them as such is probably higher than the number of times the witness saw a female and mistakenly identified them as male.

4. Therefore, while the probability of an attacker being male in the general population is 15%, the probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, is likely to be higher.

5. Without more specific information, it's not possible to provide an exact number for this probability. However, we can infer that it must be higher than 15% because the witness's correct identification suggests that the attacker was more likely to be male than female, given their error rate.

So, the best estimate we can give, given the limitations of the information provided, is that the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is likely to be greater than 0.15 (15%). However, without more specific information, it's not possible to provide a precise number.

{probability: greater than 0.15, but an exact number cannot be provided}
