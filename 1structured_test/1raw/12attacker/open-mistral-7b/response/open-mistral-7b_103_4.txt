To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the initial population distribution and the witness's error rate.

1. The population distribution is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

a) The attacker is actually male, and the witness correctly identified the gender.
b) The attacker is female, and the witness made an error in their identification.

Let's calculate the probabilities for these two scenarios:

a) Probability of scenario a: 15% (probability of the attacker being male in the general population)

b) Probability of scenario b: 85% (probability of the attacker being female in the general population) * 0.20 (probability of the witness erring in their gender identification) = 0.17 (17%)

The combined probability of the witness being correct (scenario a) or incorrect but still identifying a female attacker as male (scenario b) is the sum of probabilities a and b: 15% + 0.17 = 0.175 or 17.5%.

However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness was 100% correct in their identification, which would mean that the attacker is indeed male. This scenario has a probability of 0.20 (witness's error rate) * 0 = 0.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probabilities of scenarios a and the error-corrected scenario b: 0.175 + 0 = 0.175 or 17.5%.
