Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our initial belief (prior) in light of new evidence (likelihood). In this case, the prior is our initial belief that the attacker is male or female, and the likelihood is the witness's observation.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's observation)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies a male as male)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is male)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability that the witness identifies someone as male)

Given that the witness is 80% accurate in identifying gender, P(B|A) = 0.8.
Given that the population is 85% female and 15% male, P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male).
Given that the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 = 0.12 * 1.25 = 0.15625

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 15.625%. This means that, given the witness's observation and the population demographics, there is about a 15.625% chance that the attacker is male.
