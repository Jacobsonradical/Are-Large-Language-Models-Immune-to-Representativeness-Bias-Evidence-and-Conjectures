To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- p as the witness's probability of correctly identifying a male (0.8)
- q as the witness's probability of incorrectly identifying a male (1 - p = 0.2)
- r as the proportion of males in the city (15%)

The witness identified the attacker as male. Given the provided information, we know that the witness was correct with probability p or incorrect with probability q.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of a random person being female is 0.85. Since the witness made an identification, the probability that the identified person is indeed a female in the city is 0.85 * (1 - P(M)) = 0.85 * P(F).

Given the witness's accuracy, we can express the probability that the witness identified a male in a city with a high proportion of female population as:

P(M) = (p * R) / (p * R + q * (1 - R))

where R = 0.15 is the probability of a random person being male in the city.

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(M) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
