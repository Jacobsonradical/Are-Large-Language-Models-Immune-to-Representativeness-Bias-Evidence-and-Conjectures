Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

1. From information "a", we know that the witness has an error rate of 20% in identifying gender. This means that when the actual gender is male, the witness will incorrectly identify it as female 20% of the time.

2. However, we also know from information "b" that the proportion of males in the population is 15%. This means that in 85% of the cases, the actual gender is female.

3. Now, when the witness identifies someone as male, there are two possibilities: either they are correct, or they are making an error (misidentifying a female as male). The probability of the first event is the true probability of the attacker being male. The probability of the second event is the error rate of the witness when identifying males.

4. Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time when identifying males, the probability of them being correct is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

5. However, we need to account for the fact that in 85% of the cases, the actual gender is female. When the witness identifies someone as male, they are actually correct only in 15% of these cases (the proportion of males). So, the probability of the witness being correct when they identify someone as male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

6. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness being correct divided by the total probability of their identification being correct or incorrect: 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.88 * 0.2) = 0.12 / 0.208 â‰ˆ 0.57 (57%).

Final answer: {probability: 0.57}
