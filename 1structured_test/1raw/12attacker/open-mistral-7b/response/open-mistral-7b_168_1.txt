The given information includes two pieces of data: the gender distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender. However, the witness's incorrect identification of the attacker's gender is not provided.

Without this crucial piece of information, it is impossible to accurately calculate the probability that the attacker is male. The witness's error rate is key to accounting for any potential misidentification.

Therefore, the answer should be:
{probability: Unable to calculate, please provide the witness's error rate in identifying gender}
