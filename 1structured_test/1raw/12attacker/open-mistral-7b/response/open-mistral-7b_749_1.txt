Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%. However, the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male. This means that if we randomly select a person from the city, the probability of that person being male is 0.15 (15%).

Now, let's consider the witness's testimony. The witness identified the attacker as male, but we know that the witness makes errors 20% of the time. This means that there's a 20% chance that the witness is mistaken and the attacker is actually female.

Given these two probabilities, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male, considering both the witness's accuracy and the city's gender distribution.

Let's denote P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male. We can write this as:

P(M) = P(Witness is correct and attacker is male) + P(Witness is mistaken and attacker is male)

The first term on the right side is the probability that the witness is correct and the attacker is male. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, and the probability of a random person being male is 0.15, we can calculate this term as:

P(Witness is correct and attacker is male) = 0.8 * 0.15

The second term on the right side is the probability that the witness is mistaken and the attacker is still male. Since the witness is mistaken 20% of the time and the probability of a random person being male is 0.15, we can calculate this term as:

P(Witness is mistaken and attacker is male) = 0.2 * 0.15

Now we can calculate the overall probability:

P(M) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.24 + 0.03 = 0.27

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.27 or 27%.
