The probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Let's break down the terms:
- H: The attacker is male
- E: The witness identified the attacker as male
- P(H): Prior probability of the attacker being male, based on the city's demographics (85% female, 15% male) = 0.15
- P(E|H): Likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male, given that the attacker is male (from the witness's statement, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time) = 0.8
- P(E|~H): Likelihood of the witness identifying a female as male, given that the attacker is not male (since the witness errs 20% of the time, this would be the same probability, 0.2)
- P(E): The overall probability of the witness making the observed statement (E)

To calculate P(E), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is male (E|H) and where the attacker is not male (E|~H), and their respective probabilities, and sum them up:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
    = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * (1 - 0.15))
    = 0.12 + 0.03
    = 0.15

Now we can calculate the posterior probability, P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.15
       = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 or 80%.
