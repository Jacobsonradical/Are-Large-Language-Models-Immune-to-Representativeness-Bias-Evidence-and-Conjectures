To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness's statement).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (witness statement)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate P(E|H), the probability of the witness stating the attacker is male given that the attacker is male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(H), the prior probability of the attacker being male. Since we don't have any prior information about the attacker, we can assume that the attacker is as likely to be male as female, or P(H) = 0.5.

Now, let's calculate P(E), the probability of the witness stating that the attacker is male. Since 15% of the population is male, P(E) = 0.15.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E) by plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.15 = 0.66667 â‰ˆ 0.67

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.67. This means that, given the witness's statement and our assumptions, we believe there is a 67% chance that the attacker is male.
