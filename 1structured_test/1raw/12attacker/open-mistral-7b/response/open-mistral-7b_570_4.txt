Given the information provided, there are two sources of probability involved: the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, there's a crucial information gap in this scenario. We don't know if the witness's 80% accuracy rate applies to identifying attackers in the dark or if it only applies to daylight situations. Without this information, we can't quantify how much the witness's error rate might increase in the dark.

Given that we don't have enough information to compute a reliable estimate, I'm unable to provide a probability percentage at this time. It would be best to collect more data or clarify the witness's accuracy in nighttime situations.
