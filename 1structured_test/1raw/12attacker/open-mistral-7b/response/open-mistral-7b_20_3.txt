To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can consider the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time.
2. 85% of the population in the city is female.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

A) The attacker is actually male.
B) The witness made an error and incorrectly identified a female as male.

The probability of scenario A is the proportion of males in the city, which is 15%. The probability of scenario B is the error rate of the witness for identifying males, which is 20%.

Since we want to find the probability of the attacker being male (scenario A), we can calculate this by subtracting the probability of the witness making an error (scenario B) from 1:

{probability: 0.85}

Final answer: The estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.85.
