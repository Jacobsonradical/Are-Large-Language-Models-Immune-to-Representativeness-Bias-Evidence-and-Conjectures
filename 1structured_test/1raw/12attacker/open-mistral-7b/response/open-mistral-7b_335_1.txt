Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break down the problem:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

The witness's error rate is 20%, so when they say "male", they are actually incorrect 20% of the time. This means they are correct 80% of the time.

However, we need to consider that the city has a gender ratio of 85% female to 15% male. If the witness is just guessing, they would be more likely to guess "female" due to the city's population demographics.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness guessing correctly given the city's gender ratio:

The probability of the witness guessing "male" is 15% (the percentage of males in the city).

Given that the witness is 80% accurate, the probability of them correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, we cannot ignore the possibility that the witness is actually correct, given their high accuracy rate. The witness's statement that the attacker is male adds some evidence to the attacker being male.

To incorporate this evidence, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness Statement) = [P(Witness Statement | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male)] / [P(Witness Statement)]

Given the information, P(Witness Statement | Attacker is Male) = 0.8, P(Attacker is Male) = 0.15, and we'll assume P(Witness Statement) = P(Attacker is Male) + P(Witness Statement | Attacker is Female) * P(Attacker is Female), where P(Witness Statement | Attacker is Female) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male, which is the complementary error rate to 0.8, or 0.2.

With these values, you can calculate the probability that the attacker is male using Bayes' theorem. However, it's important to note that without knowing the exact probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male, we cannot provide an exact probability for the attacker being male.

As a conservative estimate, we can use the 12% probability calculated earlier (P(Attacker is Male | Witness Statement) = 0.12) as our answer, but it's important to note that this is a simplification and may not accurately reflect the true probability.
