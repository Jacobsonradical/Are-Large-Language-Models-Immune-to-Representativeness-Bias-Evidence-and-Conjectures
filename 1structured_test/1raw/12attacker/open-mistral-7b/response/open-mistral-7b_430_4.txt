To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the true probability that the attacker is male as p, and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as a male as q = 0.2 (from information b).

Given the witness's statement that the attacker is male, we can formulate two possible scenarios:

1) The attacker is actually male (p). The witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender with probability 1 - q = 0.8.

2) The attacker is actually female (1 - p). The witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as male with probability q = 0.2.

From the information given, we know that the probability of scenario 1 happening is equal to the probability of scenario 2 happening. So we can set up the equation:

p * (1 - q) = (1 - p) * q

Now we have a single equation with two unknowns, p and q. However, we only need to find the probability p. Solving this equation requires more information or making an assumption about q.

Since we do not have additional information, we can make an assumption that the witness's error rate is the same for males and females (i.e., q = 0.2 is the probability of mistaking a male for a female, and also the probability of mistaking a female for a male).

With this assumption, we can simplify the equation to:

p = (1 - q) / 2 = 0.8 / 2 = 0.4

However, the information given suggests that the majority of the city's population is female (p > 0.5). Assuming the witness's error rate is the same for males and females may not accurately reflect reality. Therefore, it is essential to consider the city's gender distribution while making an estimate.

Considering the city's gender distribution and the witness's error rate, it seems reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker is male to be less than 0.5.

{probability: 0.4, please note that this estimate is sensitive to the assumption of the witness's equal error rate}
