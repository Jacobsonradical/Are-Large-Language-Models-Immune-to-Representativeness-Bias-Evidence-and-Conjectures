Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, we also have a witness who, under similar conditions, correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male.

Let's consider two scenarios:

Scenario A: The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender. In this case, the attacker is actually male.
Scenario B: The witness made an error. In this case, the attacker is actually female, but the witness mistook them for male.

Since we only have the witness's word that the attacker is male, we can't directly use the population statistics to estimate the probability. Instead, we need to consider the possibility of the witness's error.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability of them making an error (i.e., misidentifying a female as male) is 20%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, and there's a 20% chance they made an error, there's a 20% chance that the attacker is actually female.

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 1 - 20% = 0.8 or 80%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.8}
