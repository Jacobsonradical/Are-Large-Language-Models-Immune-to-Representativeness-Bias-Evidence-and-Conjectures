Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population distribution and the witness's observations. The population distribution suggests that 85% of the city's population is female, while the witness, who is not perfect, identifies genders with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

The witness's identification of the attacker as male gives us an additional piece of information. However, we cannot directly use this information without considering the possibility of a misidentification. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, there is a 20% chance that the witness's identification of the attacker as male is incorrect.

If we assume that the witness is correct, then the attacker is indeed male, and the probability of this event is the proportion of males in the population, which is 15%. However, if we consider the possibility of a misidentification, we should also consider the probability that the witness is incorrect and the attacker is actually female.

The probability of a misidentification is 20%, and the probability of the witness being correct is 80%. So, the probability of the witness being correct and the attacker being male is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

Therefore, considering both the population distribution and the witness's ability to identify genders, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 12%.
