To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

Given that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male, the attacker's gender is a random event. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as male introduces an element of uncertainty.

The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80%, meaning they will correctly identify a person's gender 8 out of 10 times. But since we don't know if the witness's mistake was misidentifying a male as female or vice versa, we can't directly apply this percentage to our situation.

To account for this uncertainty, we should consider both possibilities: the witness correctly identified a male attacker and the witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male.

Let's denote the probability of a male attacker as P(M), and the probability of a female attacker as P(F). We know that P(M) + P(F) = 1, since there are only two possibilities.

The witness correctly identified a male attacker with a probability of P(M). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is 1 - P(F).

The total probability of the witness identifying an attacker as male is:

P(Witness says male) = P(M) + (1 - P(F)) * 0.20

Given that the witness said the attacker was male, we can set up an equation:

0.85 = P(Witness says male)

Substituting P(Witness says male) into the equation, we get:

0.85 = P(M) + (1 - P(F)) * 0.20

To solve for P(M), we need to make an assumption about the distribution of errors when the witness misidentifies a female as male. If we assume that the witness makes an equal number of errors in both directions (i.e., misidentifying males as females and females as males), then we can set:

1 - P(F) = 0.20

Now we can substitute this into our main equation:

0.85 = P(M) + (1 - P(F)) * 0.20
0.85 = P(M) + 0.20 * 0.20
0.85 = P(M) + 0.04

So,

P(M) = 0.81

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.81 or 81%.
