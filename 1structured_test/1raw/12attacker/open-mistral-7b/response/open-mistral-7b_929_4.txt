To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Given the information at hand, we can break it down as follows:

1. P(E | H) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, which is given as 0.8 (80%) in the question.
2. P(E | ~H) is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, which is given as 0.2 (20%) in the question, where ~H represents the opposite of H, i.e., the attacker being female.
3. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we are trying to find.
4. P(E) is the probability of the witness's identification, which is the sum of P(E | H) and P(E | ~H).

Using the given information, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ~H) * P(~H)
P(E) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H))

However, we do not have the value of P(H) yet. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this value:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H) = [P(E | H) * P(H | E)] / P(E)

Now we can substitute this expression for P(H) into the equation for P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * [P(E | H) * P(H | E)] / P(E) + 0.2 * [P(E | ~H) * P(H | ~E)] / P(E)

But we do not have the value of P(H | ~E) yet. We can assume that P(H | ~E) = P(~H | E) (the principle of conditional symmetry), which means that the witness makes the same error rate for identifying males as females. Given that the witness makes errors 20% of the time, this means P(~H | E) = 0.2, and therefore P(H | ~E) = 0.8.

Now we can write the equation for P(E) again:

P(E) = 0.8 * [P(E | H) * P(H | E)] / P(E) + 0.2 * [0.8 * P(E | ~H) * P(~H | ~E)] / P(E)

Solving this equation for P(E) would require additional information, but we can use it to find P(H):

P(H) = [P(E | H) * P(H | E)] / P(E)

However, we cannot calculate P(H) exactly without knowing P(E). Instead, we can use the given prior probability of the population being male, which is 15% (given in part b of the question), as an approximation for P(H).

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, based on the given information and assuming the principle of conditional symmetry, is approximately 15%.
