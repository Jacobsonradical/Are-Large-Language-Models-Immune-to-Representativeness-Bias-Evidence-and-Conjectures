To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness incorrectly identifies a person's gender 20% of the time.
2. Gender distribution in the city: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male as male (true positive) and a female as male (false positive):

1. True positive: Probability of a male being present and the witness correctly identifying him as male = 0.15 (probability of a male) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12
2. False positive: Probability of a female being present and the witness incorrectly identifying her as male = 0.85 (probability of a female) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male as female (false negative) and a female as female (true negative):

1. False negative: Probability of a male being present and the witness incorrectly identifying him as female = 0.15 (probability of a male) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.03
2. True negative: Probability of a female being present and the witness correctly identifying her as female = 0.85 (probability of a female) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.68

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the probability of a male being the attacker given the witness's statement. This is the probability of a false positive (the witness incorrectly identified a female as male) plus the probability of a true positive (the witness correctly identified a male as male):

Estimated probability that the attacker is male = 0.17 (false positive) + 0.12 (true positive) = 0.29

{probability: 0.29}
