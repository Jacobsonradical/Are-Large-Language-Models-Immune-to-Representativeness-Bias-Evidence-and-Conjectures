To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an informed decision.

From the first piece of information, we know that the witness had an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender and a 20% error rate. However, since we don't know the exact gender of the attacker, we cannot directly use this information.

The second piece of information tells us that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This proportion might not be representative of the people the witness saw that night, but it's the best information we have to make an educated guess.

Given that the witness was able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time, it's reasonable to assume that, if the attacker was a male, the witness would have identified them as such with a 0.8 probability.

However, the witness also made errors 20% of the time. If the attacker was actually female, and the witness still identified them as male, that would be an error. Given that 85% of the population is female, it's more likely that the witness would make an error by identifying a female as male than by incorrectly identifying a male as female.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is likely lower than 0.8, but higher than 0.15 (the probability of a random person being male in the city). To calculate an exact probability, we would need more specific information, such as the exact proportion of males among the people the witness saw that night.

However, without such information, a rough estimate could be to assume that the error rate from the witness's ability to identify gender is added to the population's gender proportion. In this case, 0.2 (the error rate) added to 0.15 (the population's male proportion) gives us 0.35, or 35%. This is a very rough estimate and should not be taken as definitive.

In conclusion, based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male is likely between 0.15 and 0.35, but a more precise estimate would require additional information.

{probability: 0.35, please note that this is a rough estimate and should not be taken as definitive}
