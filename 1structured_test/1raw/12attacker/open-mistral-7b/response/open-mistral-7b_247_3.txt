To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. Population distribution: According to the given information, 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. Witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the error rate is not specified as biased towards one gender or the other.

Given that we don't have enough information to determine if the witness's error rate is biased, we cannot directly adjust the population distribution. Therefore, we will use the raw population proportions to calculate an initial estimate and then adjust it based on the witness's accuracy.

Initial estimate:
Since the attacker's gender was not directly observed, we should consider both possibilities equally likely. The attacker could be male with a probability of 15% (based on the population distribution) or female with a probability of 85%.

Adjusted estimate:
However, the witness identified the attacker as male. If we assume the witness's error rate is random, their identification increases the probability that the attacker is male by the factor of their accuracy. In this case, the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender 80% of the time.

So, the adjusted probability that the attacker is male is 15% (initial estimate) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12 or 12%.

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
