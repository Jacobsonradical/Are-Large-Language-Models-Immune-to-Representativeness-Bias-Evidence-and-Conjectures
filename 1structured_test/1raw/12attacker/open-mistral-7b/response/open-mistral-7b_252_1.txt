Given the two pieces of information, we have a base probability of the attacker being male based on the city's population and a probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender.

1. The base probability of the attacker being male is 15% (from information "a").
2. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 (from information "b").
3. However, the witness also incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time (also from information "b").
4. Since we don't know the gender of the attacker, we can assume that the witness's erroneous identification of females as males would cancel out the correct identification of males by the witness. In other words, the witness's identification of the attacker as male does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually male.
5. Therefore, the base probability of the attacker being male remains unchanged at 15%.

The probability that the attacker is male is: {probability: 0.15}

In conclusion, despite the witness's statement, the probability that the attacker is male remains at 15%, which is the same as the male population percentage in the city. The witness's identification of the attacker as male does not change this probability, given the information provided.
