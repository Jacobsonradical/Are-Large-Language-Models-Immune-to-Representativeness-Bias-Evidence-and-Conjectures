To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know the exact gender of the attacker, we can treat the witness's errors as equally likely to be either misidentifying a female as male or a male as female.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the gender distribution in this case is approximately 0.85 female and 0.15 male.

Let's assume that the witness errs in identifying the attacker's gender. If the actual gender of the attacker is female, the witness would mistakenly identify the attacker as male 20% of the time. This means that the attacker is actually female 80% of the time when the witness errs.

On the other hand, if the actual gender of the attacker is male, the witness would mistakenly identify the attacker as female 20% of the time. This means that the attacker is actually male 80% of the time when the witness errs.

Since the witness's errors are equally likely to be either misidentifying a female as male or a male as female, we can weight the two possibilities based on the actual gender distribution in the population.

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's error, is the probability of the witness erring and the attacker being male, which is:

0.20 * 0.15 = 0.03 or 3%

However, we need to consider the fact that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is:

0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%

So, based on the witness's ability to judge gender and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 12%.
