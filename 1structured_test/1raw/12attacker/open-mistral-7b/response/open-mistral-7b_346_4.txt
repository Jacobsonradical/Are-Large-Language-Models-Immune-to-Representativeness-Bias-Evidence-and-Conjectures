Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the city's population demographics and the witness's ability to identify gender.

1. The city's demographics suggest that 15% of the population is male. However, this information alone does not account for the witness's error rate or the possibility that the witness might have misidentified the attacker's gender.

2. The witness incorrectly identified a person's gender 20% of the time. This means that they correctly identified gender 80% of the time. Given that they identified the attacker as male, there is an 80% chance that they are correct and a 20% chance that they are incorrect.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both sources of evidence. We can assume that the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is independent of the city's demographics. In other words, the witness's accuracy rate is a constant, regardless of the gender ratio in the population.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, and they are correct 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (or 80%).
