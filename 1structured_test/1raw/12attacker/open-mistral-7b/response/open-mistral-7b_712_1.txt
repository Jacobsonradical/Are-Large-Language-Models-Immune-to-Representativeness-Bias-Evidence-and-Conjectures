Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the city's population demographics and the witness's ability to accurately identify gender.

1. According to the city's demographics, 15% of the population is male. This is our baseline probability if we had no other information.

2. The witness's ability to identify gender is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. This means that in 80% of cases, the witness correctly identifies a person's gender, and in 20% of cases, the witness makes an error.

However, we need to account for the fact that the witness made an error in this case. If the witness identified the attacker as male, it means that the witness was incorrect 20% of the time when they should have identified a female.

So, the probability that the attacker is actually female, given the witness's mistake, is 1 - the probability the witness makes an error when identifying a female. This is equivalent to 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now, since the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability that the attacker is female in the city's population is 0.85.

Given that the witness made an error and identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability of the witness making an error times the probability of the attacker being male in the population. This is equivalent to 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's mistake, is 0.03.

However, we need to account for the initial 15% probability that the attacker is male in the city's population. The witness's mistake increases this probability, but it does not eliminate it. So, the final probability that the attacker is male is the probability of the attacker being male in the city's population plus the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's mistake.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 + 0.03 = 0.18 or 18%.
