To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the city's gender distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male, as stated in the first piece of information. However, the witness's identification is not perfectly reliable. In 20% of their cases, they mistake a person's gender.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possibilities:
1. The witness correctly identified a male attacker.
2. The witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male.

Since the city's gender distribution is 85% female, the probability of the second scenario is 0.85 (the probability of drawing a female) * 0.20 (the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male).

So, the probability of the first scenario, which is the attacker being male, is 1 - the probability of the second scenario.

{probability: 1 - 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.85 * 0.80 = 0.68, or 68%}

However, the witness's statement implies that they are more confident in their gender identification than their 80% accuracy rate might suggest. They identified the attacker as male, not just "probably male." This additional information suggests that they are more certain about their gender identification in this case than in their general sample.

Given this additional information, it seems reasonable to assume that the witness's confidence level in this case is higher than their general accuracy rate of 80%. Let's assume their confidence level is 90%.

Since the city's gender distribution is 85% female, the probability of the second scenario, where the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male, is now lower. It's 0.85 * 0.10 = 0.085.

The probability of the first scenario, which is the attacker being male, is now 1 - the probability of the second scenario.

{probability: 1 - 0.085 = 0.915, or 91.5%}

Considering both the city's gender distribution and the witness's confidence level, the estimated probability of the attacker being male is 91.5%.
