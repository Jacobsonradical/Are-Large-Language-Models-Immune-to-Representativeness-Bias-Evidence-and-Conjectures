To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the actual gender distribution in the city and the witness's error rate in identifying genders.

1. The actual gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time.

When the witness makes an error, they misidentify a person's gender. Since we don't know the gender of the attacker, we cannot assume that the witness's error was always in the direction of misidentifying a female as male. Therefore, we must consider both types of errors (misidentifying a male as female and misidentifying a female as male) equally likely.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). The probability that the witness misidentifies a male as female is 20% * P(male), and the probability that the witness misidentifies a female as male is 20% * (1 - P(male)).

The witness's statement suggests that they identified the attacker as male. This means that the probability of their misidentifying a female as male (20% * (1 - P(male))) is less than the probability of their correctly identifying the attacker as male (P(male)).

Therefore, we can write an inequality:

20% * (1 - P(male)) < P(male)

To solve this inequality, we can rearrange it to get:

P(male) > 0.8

This result suggests that the actual probability of the attacker being male is greater than 80% (or 0.8), given the witness's statement and the city's gender distribution. However, the given information does not allow us to provide a precise numerical estimate.

So, the answer in the requested dictionary format is:
{probability: > 0.8, please note that the exact probability cannot be determined from the given information}
