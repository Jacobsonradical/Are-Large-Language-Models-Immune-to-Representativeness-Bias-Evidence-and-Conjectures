To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an educated guess. The two pieces of information we have are:

a) The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.
b) A witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender erred in identifying the attacker as male.

Since we cannot discount the possibility of the witness's error, we should consider the actual probability of the attacker being male and the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being male based on the city's population:

P(male) = 0.15

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness misidentifying a female as male:

P(witness_error) = 0.20 (provided in information b)

Since there is a higher percentage of females in the population, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male is the more likely scenario. To find this probability, we can calculate the probability of choosing a female and having the witness misidentify her as male:

P(witness_error | female) = P(witness_error) * P(female) / (P(female) + P(male))

P(female) = 0.85 (from information a)

P(witness_error | female) = 0.20 * 0.85 / (0.85 + 0.15) = 0.16

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being female and the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male:

P(correct_identification | female) = 1 - P(witness_error | female) = 0.84

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being female based on this information:

P(female | witness_male) = P(female) * P(correct_identification | female) / (P(male) * P(witness_error) + P(female) * P(correct_identification | female))

P(female | witness_male) = 0.85 * 0.84 / (0.15 * 0.20 + 0.85 * 0.84) = 0.70

Since P(female | witness_male) is greater than 0.5, it suggests that the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify a female as male than to correctly identify a male. Given this information, it is less probable that the attacker is male, contrary to the witness's statement.

However, it is essential to remember that this is an estimate based on the available information and assumptions. The actual probability may be different due to factors not considered, such as the witness's individual biases, lighting conditions, or the victim's description of the attacker.

In summary, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.16, please note that this is an estimate and may be subject to error due to unconsidered factors}
