Given the information provided, the population is 85% female and 15% male. However, a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender erred in identifying the attacker as male. This means that the witness misidentified a female as male 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, and there's a 20% chance that the witness's misidentification is due to a female being mistakenly identified as male, we can subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that the attacker is indeed male.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6}

The attacker has a 60% probability of being male based on the witness's account. However, it's important to note that this estimate is dependent on the accuracy of the witness's gender identification and does not take into account other potential evidence or factors.
