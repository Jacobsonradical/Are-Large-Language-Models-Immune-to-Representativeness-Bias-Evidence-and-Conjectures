To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the population.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and considering that the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female (a false negative) and incorrectly identifying a female as male (a false positive).

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male) and the probability of the witness misidentifying a male as female as P(misidentify|male).

Given that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, we can calculate P(misidentify|male) as follows:

P(misidentify|male) = 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time)

Now, let's denote the probability of the witness misidentifying a female as male as P(misidentify|female). Since the witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time, we can calculate P(misidentify|female) as follows:

P(misidentify|female) = 0.2 * (1/0.8) = 0.25 (since the witness needs to be wrong twice in a row to misidentify a female as male)

Now, since the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the expected probability of the witness misidentifying a male as a female (P(misidentify|male) * P(male)) and the expected probability of the witness misidentifying a female as a male (P(misidentify|female) * P(female)).

The probability of the witness making a mistake (P(mistake)) is the sum of the expected probabilities of these two cases:

P(mistake) = P(misidentify|male) * P(male) + P(misidentify|female) * P(female)

P(mistake) = 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.25 * 0.85 = 0.21

We know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time (P(mistake) = 0.2), so the probability of the witness being correct is 1 - P(mistake) = 0.79.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male (P(male)) is the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male.

P(male) = P(correct|male) = (1 - P(mistake|male))

P(mistake|male) = P(misidentify|male) = 0.2

So, P(male) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8.
