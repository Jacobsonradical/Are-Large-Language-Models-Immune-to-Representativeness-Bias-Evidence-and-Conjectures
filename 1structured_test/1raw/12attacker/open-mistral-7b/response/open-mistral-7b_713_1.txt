To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. From the population distribution (information "a"), we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's reliability, as stated in information "b", is 80% correct and 20% incorrect in identifying gender.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, it's not enough to simply rely on the population distribution since the witness's identification might not be accurate. To account for the witness's error rate, we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct under the assumption that the attacker is indeed male, and then compare this probability with the probability of the witness's identification being correct under the assumption that the attacker is female.

Let P(m) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(f) be the probability that the attacker is female. The witness correctly identified the attacker as male if and only if the attacker is male. So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male, is P(m).

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male, is 1 - P(m).

Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, we can write the equation:

(1 - P(m)) = 0.2

Now let's consider the case where the attacker is female. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male is P(f) * error rate, which is P(f) * 0.2.

Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we can write the equation:

P(m) = 0.8 * P(f)

Now we have two equations with two variables:

1. (1 - P(m)) = 0.2
2. P(m) = 0.8 * P(f)

We can solve the second equation for P(f):

P(f) = P(m) / 0.8

Now substitute this expression for P(f) into the first equation:

(1 - P(m)) = 0.2
(1 - P(m) / 0.8) = 0.2

Now we can solve for P(m):

P(m) = 0.8 * 0.2 + 0.8 = 0.64

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
