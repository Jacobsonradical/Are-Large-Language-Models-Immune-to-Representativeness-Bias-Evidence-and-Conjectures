Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male as follows:

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. In a city where 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can assume that the probability of encountering a male person is 0.15 (15%).
3. However, due to the witness's error rate, we need to adjust this probability. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, we can expect that 20% of the times the witness identifies a male as such, it might actually be a female.
4. This means that the true probability of encountering a male person, considering the witness's errors, is lower than 0.15.
5. To find this probability, we can subtract the expected number of times the witness errs and identifies a female as male from the actual probability of encountering a male person.

Let's calculate this:

1. The expected number of times the witness errs is 0.15 (probability of a male) * 0.20 (error rate) = 0.03 (3%)
2. The true probability of encountering a male person, considering errors, is 0.15 - 0.03 = 0.12 (12%)

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
