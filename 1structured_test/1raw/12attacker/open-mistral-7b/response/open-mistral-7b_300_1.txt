To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The gender distribution in the city: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Since we don't have enough information to determine if the witness's error rate is different for males and females, we will assume that the error rate is the same for both genders (20%). This assumption is based on the lack of evidence to the contrary.

Let P(m) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(f) be the probability that the attacker is female. Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write the following equation:

P(m) * 0.8 + P(f) * 0.2 = 1 (witness's correct identification rate)

Since 85% of the population is female, P(f) = 0.15. To find P(m), we can solve the equation for P(m):

P(m) = (1 - P(f)) / 0.8 = 0.85 / 0.8 = 1.0625

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, the witness's identification likely contained an error. Let's assume that the witness erred in this case, and the actual attacker is female. In that case, the witness's statement would be incorrect, but we would still need to adjust our estimate for the gender distribution in the city.

If we assume that the witness's error rate is 20%, then the actual probability that the attacker is male is:

P(m) = (1 - 0.15) * 0.2 / 0.2 = 0.85

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker is male is 0.85, given the information provided.
