To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

From the population distribution, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. However, since the witness's identification was incorrect 20% of the time, we cannot simply rely on the population distribution to make an estimate.

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, so we can use this information to adjust our estimate. If we randomly select a person from the city and the witness correctly identifies their gender, it's likely that this person is indeed from the identified gender.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker is the product of the attacker being male and the witness correctly identifying a male, which is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

Similarly, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male is the product of the attacker being female and the witness incorrectly identifying a female, which is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the total probability of this event is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(male) = P(witness correctly identifies male) + P(witness incorrectly identifies female)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.29, or 29%.
