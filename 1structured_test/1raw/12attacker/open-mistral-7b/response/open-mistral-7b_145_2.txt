Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population statistics and the witness's testimony.

1. As per the population statistics (source a), 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. This means that the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

2. However, we also have the witness's testimony (source b) which identified the attacker as male with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate. This means that if the witness were to make a guess based on their gender perception, they would correctly identify the attacker's gender as male 80% of the time.

Given that we don't have any direct evidence to contradict the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our initial probability estimate based on the witness's testimony. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B can be calculated as P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male, P(A) is the initial probability of the attacker being male (0.15), P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male (0.8), and P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying anyone as male (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.6).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the updated probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony: P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.6) = 0.12.

So, after accounting for the witness's testimony, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12 or 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the given assumptions and may not fully account for all possible factors or uncertainties.
