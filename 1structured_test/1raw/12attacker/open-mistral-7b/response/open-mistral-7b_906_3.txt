Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

The witness's accuracy in identifying gender means that in a fair sample, they would incorrectly identify a female as male 20% of the time. However, in this case, they identified the attacker as male. Since the population is heavily female (85%), it's more likely that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually female.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. The probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male is 0.8 (80%).
2. The probability of the witness being wrong given that the attacker is male is 0.2 (20%).
3. The probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is female is 0 (since the witness never identified a female as male).
4. The probability of the witness being wrong given that the attacker is female is 1 (since the witness always errs and identifies a female as male in this scenario).

Given that the population is heavily female, it's more likely that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually female. So, we can use the probability of the witness being wrong given that the attacker is female to estimate the probability of the attacker being male.

The probability of the attacker being male = Probability of witness being wrong given that the attacker is female = 1

However, we should consider the bias of the witness in identifying genders. Given that the witness is only 80% accurate, we should adjust the probability to account for this.

Let's say the actual probability of the attacker being male is P. Then the probability of the witness being wrong given that the attacker is male is P * (1 - 0.8) = 0.2P.

Given that the population is 85% female, the probability of a random person being female is 0.85. Since the witness is only 80% accurate, the probability of the witness identifying a random person as male is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

So, the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is female is 1 - 0.12 = 0.88.

We can set up an equation: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.2P, and 0.88 = 1 - 0.2P. Solving this system of equations, we get P = 0.069 (approximately 6.9%).

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 6.9%. However, this estimation is based on several assumptions and may not be fully accurate.
