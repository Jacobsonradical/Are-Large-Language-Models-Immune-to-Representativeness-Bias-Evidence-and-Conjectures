Given the information provided, we have two pieces of evidence:

1. The population statistics, which suggest that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male.
2. The witness's ability to identify gender, which is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.

However, the witness's error rate is not specific to misidentifying the attacker's gender as female when the attacker is actually male. We don't have enough information to determine the error rate of misidentifying a male attacker as female.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to strictly provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. Our analysis is limited to the population statistics and the witness's general ability to identify gender, which does not directly apply to the specific case of the attack.
