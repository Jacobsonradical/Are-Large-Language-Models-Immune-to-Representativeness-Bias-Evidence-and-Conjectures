Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's calculate the probability of the attacker being female first and then subtract it from 1 to find the probability of the attacker being male.

The probability of the attacker being female, based on the city's gender distribution, is:
{probability: 0.85}

Now, we can find the probability of the attacker being male by subtracting this value from 1:

{probability: 1 - 0.85 = 0.15}

The estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 or 15%.
