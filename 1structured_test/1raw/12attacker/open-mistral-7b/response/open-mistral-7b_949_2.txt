To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as male, even if the attacker is actually female.

Let's denote the probability of the witness erring as e and the probability of the attacker being male as m. We know that e = 0.2 (erring rate), and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 1 - e = 0.8 (correct rate).

Since there are more females in the city, the probability of a random person being female is 0.85. The probability of a random person being male is therefore 0.15.

The witness will err and identify a female as male with probability e * 0.85 (probability of a female * error rate). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is (1 - e) * 0.15 (probability of a male * correct rate).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male and the probability of the witness erring and identifying a female as male:

m = (1 - e) * 0.15 + e * 0.85

Substituting e = 0.2:

m = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)
m = 0.12 + 0.17
m = 0.29

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%.
