Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can help us estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

1. The population statistics: We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, the witness's assessment is not based on the city's population statistics but on their own ability to judge gender. Therefore, we cannot directly apply the city's population statistics to the witness's error rate.

Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and their error rate. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is proportional to the probability of B given A times the prior probability of A. In our case, event A is that the attacker is male, and event B is the witness's statement that the attacker is male.

Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female. According to the witness, P(B|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a male 80% of the time), and P(B|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified a female as male 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find P(M|B) as follows:

P(M|B) = P(B|M) * P(M) / [P(B|M) * P(M) + P(B|F) * P(F)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(M|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.13

The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 13%. Please note that this estimate is based on the witness's error rate, which may not accurately represent the city's population statistics. Therefore, this estimate should be treated with caution.
