To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can consider two scenarios:

1. The witness's observation is accurate.
2. The witness's observation is inaccurate.

Scenario 1: The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender as male. In this case, the attacker is indeed male, as the witness reported. Since we know that 15% of the city's population is male, this scenario corresponds to a 15% probability.

Scenario 2: The witness incorrectly identified the attacker's gender. In this case, the attacker is actually female, despite the witness's report. Since 85% of the city's population is female, this scenario corresponds to an 85% probability.

However, we should take into account the witness's ability to accurately identify gender. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness reported the attacker as male, this means that the scenario 2 (witness's error) is more likely if the actual gender of the attacker is female.

So, the probability of the witness's error given that the attacker is female is 20%. Therefore, the probability of the witness's correct observation given that the attacker is female is 1 - 20% = 80%.

Given that the attacker is actually female, the probability of the witness reporting the attacker as male is 0.8 (80%).

Now, since the probability of the witness reporting the attacker as male is 0.8, and the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85, we can find the probability of both events happening (witness's report and attacker being female) by multiplying these probabilities:

P(witness's report and attacker is female) = P(witness's report | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female) = 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68

The probability of the witness's report and attacker being male is the complement of this, as the two probabilities add up to 1:

P(witness's report and attacker is male) = 1 - 0.68 = 0.32

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.32.

In summary:
{probability: 0.32}
