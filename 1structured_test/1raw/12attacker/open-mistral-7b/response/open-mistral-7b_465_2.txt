To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

In this case, our events are:
1. H0: The attacker is female.
2. H1: The attacker is male.

We have two pieces of information:
1. P(H0): Prior probability of the attacker being female in the population. This can be estimated using the city's demographic data. From information b, P(H0) = 0.85.
2. P(H1): Prior probability of the attacker being male in the population. This is the complement of P(H0), so P(H1) = 1 - P(H0) = 0.15.
3. P(w|H0): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female. From information a, P(w|H0) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time).
4. P(w|H1): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. From information a, P(w|H1) = 1 - P(w|H0) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's observation:

P(H1|w) = P(w|H1) * P(H1) / [P(w|H0) * P(H0) + P(w|H1) * P(H1)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(H1|w) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.2 * 0.85) + (0.8 * 0.15)]

Calculating this gives us an estimate of 0.45 or 45% that the attacker is male. However, since the witness's error rate is 20%, it's possible that the attacker's gender was misidentified. To account for this, we might want to consider a smaller probability for the attacker being male, such as 36% (0.4 * 0.9) to account for the possibility of the witness's error.

So, in the strict dictionary format:
