To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given and the reliability of the witness's gender identification.

1. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male.

Since the attacker's gender is unknown, we can assume two scenarios: the attacker is male (true positive) and the attacker is female (false positive). We want to find the probability of the first scenario, which is the attacker being male.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, this means that when the attacker is indeed female, the witness will mistakenly identify her as male 20% of the time. This error rate can be considered as the probability of a false positive.

We know that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male. However, without knowing the actual gender of the attacker, we can't be sure if this was a true positive or a false positive. To account for both possibilities, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male (P(M|E)) given the evidence (E) of the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states: P(M|E) = [P(E|M) * P(M)] / [P(E|M) * P(M) + P(E|~M) * P(~M)]

Where:
- P(M) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (15% in this case)
- P(~M) is the prior probability of the attacker being female (85% in this case)
- P(E|M) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker
- P(E|~M) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male

The likelihoods P(E|M) and P(E|~M) can be calculated by using the witness's performance rate. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(E|M) = 0.8 and P(E|~M) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male as follows:

P(M|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 12%.
