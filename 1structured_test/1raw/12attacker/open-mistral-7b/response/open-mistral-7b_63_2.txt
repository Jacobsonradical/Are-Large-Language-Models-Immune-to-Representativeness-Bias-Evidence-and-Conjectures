Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the population.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, meaning they misidentify 20% of the time. Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, and the witness's errors are distributed evenly between genders, the witness's errors in identifying gender would be spread out as follows:

- 20% of the time, the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)
- 20% of the time, the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female (0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03)

The witness's correct identification of gender is then:

- 80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies a female as female (0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68)
- 80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies a male as male (0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12)

To find the probability that the attacker is male, we add the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male:

(0.12) + (0.03) = 0.15

The probability that the attacker is male is estimated to be 15%.

{probability: 0.15}
