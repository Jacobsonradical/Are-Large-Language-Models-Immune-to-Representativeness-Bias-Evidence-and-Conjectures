Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, our prior belief (before the witness's statement) is that the attacker could be either male or female, given the city's gender distribution (85% female and 15% male). The new evidence is the witness's statement identifying the attacker as male.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male, which is what we want to estimate.
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female.
- P(W|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker.
- P(W|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male.

Given the information in the first piece of data, we can calculate P(W|M) as 0.8 and P(W|F) as 0.2, as the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Given the information in the second piece of data, we can calculate P(M) as 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female) and P(F) as 0.85 (since 15% of the population is male).

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Solving this equation, we get:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.19

So, given the witness's statement and the city's gender distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 19%.
