To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness's observation).

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is male
- β: the prior probability of H, which is given as 15% (0.15)
- E: the witness's observation
- π(E|H): the probability of E given H, which is the witness's accuracy in identifying males, 80% (0.8)
- π(E|~H): the probability of E given not-H (the attacker being female), which is the witness's error rate in identifying males, 20% (0.2)
- π(~H): the prior probability of not-H, which is given as 85% (0.85)

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of H given E is:

P(H|E) = π(E|H) * β / (π(E|H) * β + π(E|~H) * (1 - β))

Substituting the given values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 / 0.172 = 0.701

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.701 or 70.1%.
