To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's error rate in gender identification and the gender distribution in the population.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the witness's error was in favor of identifying the attacker as male or female, we can assume that the error rate is equally distributed between the two genders. This means that the witness misidentifies males as females 10% of the time and females as males 10% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of encountering a female person is 0.85. If the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, the probability that the actual attacker is male becomes higher.

The probability of the witness identifying a female as male is 0.1 (10% error rate). So, the probability of the actual attacker being male given this error is 0.85 (probability of encountering a female) * 0.1 (error rate).

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male as male, which is correct: 0.15 (probability of encountering a male) * 0.8 (correct identification rate).

Since we don't know if the witness's statement is correct or not, we should consider both probabilities and find the average. The probability of the attacker being male is the sum of these two probabilities divided by 2:

(0.85 * 0.1 + 0.15 * 0.8) / 2 = 0.158 or 15.8%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 15.8%.
