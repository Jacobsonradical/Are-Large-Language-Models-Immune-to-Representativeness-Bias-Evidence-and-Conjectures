Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population demographics and the witness's gender identification accuracy.

1. From the population demographics (information "a"), we know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.

2. From the witness's gender identification accuracy (information "b"), we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's error rate is higher for misidentifying females as males or males as females.

Since we don't have enough information to consider the gender identification error rate, we can only rely on the population demographics. Therefore, based on the population statistics, the attacker is estimated to be male with a probability of 15%.
