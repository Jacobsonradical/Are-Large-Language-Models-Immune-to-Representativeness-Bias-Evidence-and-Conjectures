Given the two pieces of information provided:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness, who is assumed to be an unbiased observer, correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, the witness's statement that the attacker was male contradicts the statistical probability of the attacker being male in the city's population. To account for this contradiction, we need to consider the possibility of the witness making an error in their gender identification.

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, and we cannot rule out the possibility that the witness made an error in this case, we should consider the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a female attacker as male.

The probability of the witness making an error in this case is equal to the proportion of females in the city, which is 0.85. Using this probability, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male as follows:

1. Probability of the witness making an error and identifying a female as male = 0.85 (probability of a female attacker)
2. Probability of the witness telling the truth and identifying a male as male = 0.15 (probability of a male attacker)

To account for both possibilities, we should add the probabilities:

Probability of the attacker being male = Probability of the witness making an error and identifying a female as male + Probability of the witness telling the truth and identifying a male as male

Probability of the attacker being male = 0.85 + 0.15 = 0.95

However, considering the witness's statement contradicts the statistical probability of the attacker being male in the city's population, it seems more reasonable to assign a lower probability to this event. Given the limited information, a more conservative estimate would be to assign the probability of the attacker being male closer to the probability of a female attacker.

Given these considerations, the probability that the attacker is male, based on the available information, is estimated to be between 0.15 and 0.85. A more conservative estimate would be closer to 0.15.
