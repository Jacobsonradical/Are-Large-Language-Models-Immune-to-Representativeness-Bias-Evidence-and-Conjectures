To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. From the information given, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness misidentifying a female attacker as a male and a male attacker as a female:

1. Probability of a female attacker: 0.85
2. Probability of the witness misidentifying a female attacker as male: 0.2 (error rate)
   Probability of the witness correctly identifying a female attacker as female: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8
3. Probability of a male attacker: 0.15
4. Probability of the witness misidentifying a male attacker as female: 0.2 (error rate)
   Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as male: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we're interested in calculating the probability of a male attacker given the witness's identification. The probability of a male attacker and the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
