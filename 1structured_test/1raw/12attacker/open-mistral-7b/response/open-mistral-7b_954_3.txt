Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have direct information about how this ability applies to the specific situation of the attack.

The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. This information could potentially be used in a Bayesian approach to update our prior belief, but it's important to note that the attacker's gender could still be different from the city's demographic.

Without a way to account for the witness's ability in this specific situation, it's not possible to provide a precise probability estimate. Therefore, I cannot strictly provide a number between 0 and 1 in the requested format.

However, if we were to make an assumption that the witness's ability to judge gender is applicable to this specific situation, then we could potentially estimate the probability based on the witness's success rate. In this case, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's identification alone would be 0.8 (80%). However, this is a simplification and may not accurately reflect the real-world situation.
