Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given some new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula is: P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is male) given the evidence (witness's identification).
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time when the person was male.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis before seeing the evidence. This is the proportion of males in the population. Given that 85% of the population is female, 15% is male.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which we can ignore because we're interested in P(H | E).

So, the calculation would look like this:

P(attacker is male | witness's identification) = P(witness's identification | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) / P(witness's identification)

P(witness's identification | attacker is male) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time when the person was male)
P(attacker is male) = 0.15 (the proportion of males in the population)
P(witness's identification) = P(witness's identification | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness's identification | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female)
P(witness's identification | attacker is female) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified gender 20% of the time when the person was female)
P(attacker is female) = 0.85 (the proportion of females in the population)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%. This estimate is lower than the 15% proportion of males in the population because the witness's ability to accurately identify gender is less than perfect.
