To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the population.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male). The probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as male when in fact the attacker is female is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male when the attacker is indeed male is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the likelihood of this event happening if the attacker is male is 0.12, and the likelihood of this event happening if the attacker is female is 0.17.

The Bayes' theorem formula for updating probabilities based on new evidence is:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / [P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | not A) * P(not A)]

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the attacker being male),
- P(B) is the probability of observing B (the witness identifying the attacker as male),
- P(A | B) is the probability of A given B (the updated probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement),
- P(B | A) is the likelihood of observing B given A (the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male),
- P(B | not A) is the likelihood of observing B given not A (the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female).

In our case:
- P(A) = P(male) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male, given the city's gender distribution)
- P(B) = P(witness identifies attacker as male) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.3 (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given the true gender distribution)
- P(B | A) = 0.12
- P(B | not A) = 0.17

Using the Bayes' theorem formula, we can calculate the updated probability P(A | B):

P(A | B) = (0.12 * 0.15) / [(0.12 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]

P(A | B) ≈ 0.15 / 0.22

P(A | B) ≈ 0.682

Therefore, given the witness's statement that the attacker is male, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 68.2%.
