Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the prior probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the prior probability (a) is the proportion of males in the city, which is 15%. The new evidence (b) is the witness's judgment of the attacker's gender, which was male.

The witness's judgment is not perfect, so we need to account for their error rate. They correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of the event A (attacker being male) given the evidence B (witness's judgment) is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker, which is 0.8 (80%). P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male, which is 0.2 (20%).

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15%). P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (85%).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.35 (35%).

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.35}
