To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given and make an adjustment for the witness's error rate.

First, let's recall that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This means that the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

However, the witness's statement suggests that there was an error in gender identification. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this must be one of the 80% of correct identifications.

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is equal to the probability of the witness making a correct identification times the probability of the attacker being male in the population:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, our estimate is that there is a 12% probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided.
