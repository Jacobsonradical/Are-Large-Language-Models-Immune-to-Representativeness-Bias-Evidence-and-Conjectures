Given the two pieces of information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The population distribution of males and females in the city, which is 15% male and 85% female.
2. The accuracy of the witness in identifying gender, which is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, the second piece of information introduces a complication. Even though the population is biased towards females, the witness's error rate is higher for male individuals than for females. This means that the witness is more likely to misidentify a male as female than a female as male.

Given this information, it would be inaccurate to simply multiply the population percentage of males by the witness's accuracy rate. Instead, we need to consider the probability of the witness's error.

Let's assume that the attacker's gender is actually male (since the witness identified the attacker as male). The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male is 0.8 (80%). The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as female is 0.2 (20%).

However, since the population is biased towards females, it is more likely that the actual attacker is female. In this case, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male is higher. Let's call this probability p.

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

1. The total probability should equal 1, so 0.8 (correct male identification) + 0.2 (incorrect male identification) = 1 - p (incorrect female identification)
2. Since the population is biased towards females, p should be larger than 0.2 (incorrect male identification in general population).

Unfortunately, without more specific information about the witness's error rate for identifying males in a female-dominated population, it's not possible to provide a precise estimate for p and, consequently, for the probability that the attacker is male. The information given does not allow us to calculate a probability between 0 and 1.

{probability: unavailable, please provide more specific information about the witness's error rate in a female-dominated population}
