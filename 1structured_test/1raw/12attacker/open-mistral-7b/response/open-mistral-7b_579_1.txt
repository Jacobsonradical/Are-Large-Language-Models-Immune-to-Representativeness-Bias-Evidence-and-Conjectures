To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we cannot know for certain if the witness was correct or made an error. However, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error in this specific case under the assumption that the attacker is actually female.

The probability of the witness erring when the attacker is female is 20%.

Since the gender distribution in the city is 85% female, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85.

So, the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is actually female is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

Therefore, the probability that the witness was correct (the attacker is male) is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 or 83%.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to identify gender is the same in all situations, which might not be the case. In reality, the witness might be more accurate when observing people in good lighting or at close range. Since the attack occurred at night and from behind, the witness's ability to identify the attacker's gender might have been lower than in the sample of people they were tested on.

Taking this into account, it seems reasonable to reduce the estimated probability that the attacker is male. But without more specific information, it's difficult to quantify this reduction accurately.

In conclusion, based on the provided information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.83, please provide a number between 0 and 1}, but this estimate should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of the witness's ability to identify gender in the specific situation of the attack.
