Based on the information provided, let's reason through this problem:
1. We know that the witness's accuracy in determining gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time.
2. The population composition is 85% female and 15% male.
3. The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, which means they erred in their judgment.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness making an error given the population composition:
1. The probability of the attacker being female is 0.85 (85%).
2. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.2 (20%).
3. Given that the witness made an error, the attacker must be female, so the probability of an error given a female attacker is 0.2.
4. On the other hand, the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15%).
5. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as male is 1 (100%), as they did not make an error in this case.
6. Given that the witness made an error, the attacker must be male, so the probability of an error given a male attacker is 1.
7. However, we only know that the witness made an error, so we need to weight these probabilities based on the actual frequencies of female and male attackers in the population.
8. The probability of a female attacker is 0.85, so the probability of making an error given a female attacker is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
9. The probability of a male attacker is 0.15, so the probability of making an error given a male attacker is 1 * 0.15 = 0.15.
10. The total probability of the witness making an error is the weighted sum of these two probabilities: 0.17 * 0.85 + 0.15 * 0.15 = 0.1435.
11. Since the witness made an error, the actual probability of the attacker being male is the probability of an error divided by the total probability of error: 0.15 / 0.1435 â‰ˆ 0.1047.

Final answer: {probability: 0.1047} The probability that the attacker is male is approximately 10.47%.
