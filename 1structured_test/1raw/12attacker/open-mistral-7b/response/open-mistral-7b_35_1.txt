To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(Male).

From the information provided, we know that the witness correctly identifies gender with a probability of 0.8 and errs with a probability of 0.2. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write an equation based on Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Witness's identification) = P(Witness's identification | Male) * P(Male) / [P(Witness's identification | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness's identification | Not Male) * P(Not Male)]

From the first piece of information, we know that P(Witness's identification | Male) = 0.8 and P(Witness's identification | Not Male) = 0.2.

From the second piece of information, we know that P(Male) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female) and P(Not Male) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(Male | Witness's identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(Male | Witness's identification) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12 or 12%. This estimate is lower than the 15% male population in the city due to the witness's error rate in gender identification.
