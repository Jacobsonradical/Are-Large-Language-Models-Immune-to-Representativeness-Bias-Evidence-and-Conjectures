To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness's gender identification is reliable 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. However, the witness made an error in this particular case, identifying the attacker as male. This suggests that the attacker is actually more likely to be female, given the city's gender distribution.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). According to the information provided, P(male) = 1 - P(female).

Given that 85% of the city's population is female, we can estimate P(female) as 0.85. Therefore, P(male) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

However, the witness made an error, so we need to adjust this probability based on the witness's reliability. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, there's a 20% chance that the witness made an error in this particular case, even if the actual probability is 0.15.

Therefore, the adjusted probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's error, would be:

{probability: 0.15 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

So, our estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's error, is 0.12 or 12%.
