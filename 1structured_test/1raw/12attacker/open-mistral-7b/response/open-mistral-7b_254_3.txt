To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- p (proportion of males in the population) = 15% (from information b)
- q (proportion of females in the population) = 1 - p = 85% (from information b)
- e (error rate of the witness) = 20% (from information a)

The witness's gender classification is a binomial trial. If we assume that the witness's gender classification is independent of the actual gender of the attacker, then the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker as male is p * (1 - e) and the probability of the witness identifying a female attacker as male is q * e.

The probability of the witness identifying an attacker as male, regardless of the actual gender, is the sum of these two probabilities.

So, the probability of the attacker being male is:

{probability: p * (1 - e) + q * e * probability_of_attack_being_female_given_witness_identification_as_male}

Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to compute the probability of an attack being female given witness identification as male. So, we'll only provide an estimate based on the first part of the equation:

{probability: p * (1 - e) = 0.15 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.135, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This estimate assumes that the probability of an attack being female given witness identification as male is 0.

However, this is a simplifying assumption, and in reality, the error rate of the witness might be influenced by the gender of the attacker. Accounting for this additional uncertainty would require a more complex analysis, which is beyond the scope of this response.
