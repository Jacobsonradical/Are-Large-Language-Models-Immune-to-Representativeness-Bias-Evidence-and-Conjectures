The given information suggests that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. However, a witness, who is not always accurate in identifying gender, reported that the attacker was male. Let's call the probability that the witness is correct when identifying a male as P_m, and the probability that the witness is incorrect as P_f (for identifying a female as male).

We know that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, so P_f = 0.2. Since the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, we can find the probability that the witness is correct when identifying a male as P_m = 15 / (15 + 85) * (1 - 0.2) = 0.12.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the product of the probability that the witness is correct and the probability that the attacker is male in the population. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.12}
