Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and our evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (the witness's identification)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness correctly identified a male attacker 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability of the attacker being male before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis)

We are given the prior probability of the attacker being male as being 15% (since 15% of the population is male), and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as 80%. However, we do not have enough information to calculate the probability of the evidence (P(E)) directly.

Instead, we can use the fact that the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time to calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake when the attacker is male. This is equivalent to the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female.

Let P(not H | E) be the probability of the witness making a mistake when the attacker is male. Then, by the principle of complementary probabilities, P(not H | E) = 1 - P(H | E) = 0.2 (since the witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time).

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female 20% of the time, and the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate P(E | not H) as the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is female. This is equivalent to the probability of the witness correctly identifying a female as male.

Let P(E | not H) be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a female as male. Then, P(E | not H) = P(not H) * P(E | not H) = 0.85 * P(female | E), where P(female | E) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male.

Since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, we can assume that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is also 20%. Therefore, P(E | not H) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Now we can calculate P(E) using the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | not H) * P(not H)
P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85
P(E) ≈ 0.21

Finally, we can calculate P(H | E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H | E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.21 ≈ 0.571

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 57.1%.
