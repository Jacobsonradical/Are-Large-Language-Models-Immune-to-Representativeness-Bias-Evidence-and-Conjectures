To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If the population is 85% female and 15% male, and the witness identifies a person as male, we can assume that there is a 15% chance that the witness is correct (the person is actually male) and an 85% chance that the witness is wrong (the person is actually female).

Let P(male) be the probability that the attacker is male. Then, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male is P(male) * 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is male and the witness is correct).

If the witness identifies a person as male, we can also assume that there is an 85% chance that the witness is wrong (the person is actually female). In this case, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is female).

The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male is P(female) * 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is female and the witness is wrong).

The witness incorrectly identifies a person as male 20% of the time. Therefore, we can write an equation:

0.2 = P(male) * 0.15 + P(female) * 0.85

Since P(male) + P(female) = 1 (the attacker is either male or female), we can rewrite the equation as:

0.2 = 0.15 * P(male) + 0.85 * (1 - P(male))

Solving for P(male), we get:

P(male) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85 * 0.8) â‰ˆ 0.11

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.11 or 11%.
