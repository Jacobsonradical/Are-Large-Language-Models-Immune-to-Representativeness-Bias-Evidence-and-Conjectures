To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

In our case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is male, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Given the information provided:
- P(E|H) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is given as 0.8 (or 80%)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male. We don't have this information directly, but we can estimate it using the city's population statistics: P(H) = 0.15 (the proportion of males in the city)
- P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is given as 0.2 (or 20%)
- P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker being female. Again, we can estimate this using the city's population statistics: P(~H) = 0.85 (the proportion of females in the city)

Since we don't have the value of P(E), we can rewrite the formula to express P(H|E) as a ratio:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the numerator and denominator, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12 or 12%. This is quite different from the witness's identification, indicating that the witness may have made an error or that the witness's ability to judge gender is not as accurate as suggested.
