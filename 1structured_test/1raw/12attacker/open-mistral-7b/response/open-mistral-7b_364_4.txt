Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. The general population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

However, we should note that the witness's identification might be influenced by bias or error. If we assume that the witness's mistake rate is evenly distributed between identifying a female as male and a male as female, then the witness's statement means that the attacker was misidentified as male 20% of the time when the attacker was actually female.

Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of the witness's statement being correct given that the attacker is male is 100%, and the probability of the witness's statement being incorrect given that the attacker is male is 0%.

On the other hand, the probability of the witness's statement being correct given that the attacker is female is 20% (the error rate), and the probability of the witness's statement being incorrect given that the attacker is female is 80%.

Since we cannot see the attacker's gender, we should consider both scenarios and their respective probabilities. The probability of the attacker being male (P(M)) is the sum of the probabilities of the witness's statement being correct given that the attacker is male (P(M|witness's statement is correct)) and the probabilities of the witness's statement being incorrect given that the attacker is female (P(M|witness's statement is incorrect)).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

P(M|witness's statement is correct) = 1
P(M|witness's statement is incorrect) = P(F) * P(witness's statement is incorrect | F) / (P(F) * P(witness's statement is incorrect | F) + P(M) * P(witness's statement is incorrect | M))

Where P(F) is the probability of the attacker being female and P(M) is the probability of the attacker being male.

Substituting the given values:

P(M|witness's statement is incorrect) = 0.85 * 0.2 / (0.85 * 0.2 + 0.15 * 1) ≈ 0.062

So, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's statement, is:

P(M) = P(M|witness's statement is correct) * P(witness's statement is correct) + P(M|witness's statement is incorrect) * P(witness's statement is incorrect)
P(M) ≈ 1 * 0.2 + 0.062 * 0.8 = 0.272

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.272 or 27.2%. This estimate takes into account both the general population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.
