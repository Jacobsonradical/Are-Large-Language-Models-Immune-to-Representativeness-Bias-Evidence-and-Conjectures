To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness identified the attacker as male but has an error rate of 20% in gender identification.

Let's break it down:

a) If the attacker were female, the probability of the witness misidentifying the gender would be 20%.
b) Given that the attacker is indeed male, there's no chance of misidentification.

So, the probability of the witness misidentifying a male attacker as female is 0, while the probability of misidentifying a female attacker as male is 20%.

Since we don't have enough information to determine if the attacker is actually female, we must consider the possibility of the witness being wrong.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

P(Male | Witness) = [P(Witness | Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Witness | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness | Female) * P(Female)]

Plugging in the values:

P(Male | Witness) = [0 * 0.15] / [0 * 0.15 + 1 * 0.85] = 0.15 / 0.85 = 0.1764705882352941

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 17.65%.
