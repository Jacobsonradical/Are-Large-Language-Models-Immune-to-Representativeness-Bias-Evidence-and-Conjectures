Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition is 85% female and 15% male.

However, it's important to note that the witness's ability to identify gender and the population composition do not directly relate to the attacker's gender, as the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's gender.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's error rate and the population composition. Since the witness made an error 20% of the time, we can assume that some of the times the witness identified the attacker as male, they were mistaken.

Let's assume the total number of people the witness observed is X. Since 80% of the time the witness correctly identified gender, we can assume that X * 0.8 are correct identifications, and X * 0.2 are errors. However, among the errors, some could be misidentifications of females as males.

Since the population composition is 85% female and 15% male, we know that X * 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12X are actual male individuals. Let's denote the number of these actual male individuals misidentified as Xm.

Given that the witness made errors 20% of the time, we can write an equation: X * 0.2 = Xm + Xf, where Xf is the number of female individuals misidentified as males.

Since Xm and Xf are the errors, they should be equal in number (assuming the witness does not have a bias towards misidentifying one gender over the other). Therefore, Xm = Xf.

Given that X * 0.15 = Xm, we can write another equation: Xf = X * 0.05.

Now, we can rewrite the first equation as Xm = X * 0.2 - X * 0.05.

Since Xm = Xf, we have X * 0.15 = X * 0.2 - X * 0.05.

Solving this equation, we get Xm = X * 0.1.

However, this problem is underspecified, and we cannot determine the exact number of X. Therefore, we cannot compute a precise probability.

In conclusion, based on the given information, it's impossible to determine the exact probability that the attacker is male. The best we can do is to say that the probability is greater than 0.1 (the proportion of actual male individuals in the population misidentified as male by the witness) but less than 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male individual). This answer is not in the required format, but I hope it helps you understand the problem better.
