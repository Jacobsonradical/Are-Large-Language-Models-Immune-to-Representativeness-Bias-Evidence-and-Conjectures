Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness has an 80% success rate in identifying gender, with a 20% error rate.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Attacker) = [P(Attacker | Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Attacker | Male) * P(Male) + P(Attacker | Female) * P(Female)]

In our case:
1. P(Attacker | Male) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, this means that when the witness identifies someone as male, the actual gender is male 80% of the time. So, P(Attacker | Male) = 0.8
2. P(Attacker | Female) is the probability that the attacker is female given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, this means that when the witness identifies someone as male, the actual gender is female 20% of the time. So, P(Attacker | Female) = 0.2 / 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.0175
3. P(Male) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 15% (0.15) based on the city's gender distribution.
4. P(Female) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 85% (0.85) based on the city's gender distribution.

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male:

P(Male | Attacker) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.0175 * 0.85)) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
