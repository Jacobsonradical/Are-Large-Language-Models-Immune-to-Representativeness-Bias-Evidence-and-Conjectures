Given the information provided, we can break this down into two parts:

1. The population distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender: 80% of the time.

However, there's an additional factor to consider: the witness's error rate. If the witness identifies a person as male 80% of the time, then they must be incorrect 20% of the time, meaning they identify a person as female when they are actually male.

The witness saw the attacker and identified them as male. But since we know that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, it's possible that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually female.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being female as P(F) and the probability of the attacker being male as P(M). We're trying to find P(M).

Given the population distribution, we know that P(F) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15.

When the witness saw the attacker, they identified them as male. So, if the attacker is actually female (P(F)), then the witness made an error. The probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is female is the error rate, 0.20. So, P(Witness identifies as male | Attacker is female) = 0.20.

Since the witness didn't identify the attacker as female, this means that P(Witness identifies as male | Attacker is male) must be 1.00 (the witness didn't make an error in this case).

We can write this out as a probability equation:

P(Witness identifies as male) = P(Witness identifies as male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness identifies as male | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female)

Substituting the known values:

0.80 = (1.00 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)

Solving for P(M):

P(M) = (0.80 - 0.20 * 0.85) / 1.00
P(M) â‰ˆ 0.115

So, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 11.5%.
