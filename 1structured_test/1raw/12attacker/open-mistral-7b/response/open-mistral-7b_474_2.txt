To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The attacker's gender is unknown, but the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we must consider both the possibility that the witness correctly identified a male attacker and the possibility that the witness made an error by misidentifying a female attacker as male.

Let's denote:
- p: the probability that the attacker is male
- q: the probability that the attacker is female
- w: the witness's accuracy in gender identification

We know that p + q = 1 (since the gender distribution in the population is given), and w * p + (1 - w) * q is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is either male or female.

The witness identified the attacker as male, so we have the equation:
w * p + (1 - w) * q = 0.8

To solve for p, we can rearrange the equation and express q in terms of p:
q = (1 - 0.8) / (1 - w) * p

Since we know that q = 1 - p, we can substitute q in the equation:
(1 - 0.8) / (1 - w) * p = 1 - p

Solve for p:
p = 1 / (1 + (1 - 0.8) / (1 - w))

Now, we need to plug in the values for w and the gender distribution in the city:

w = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to correctly identify gender)
p = 1 / (1 + (1 - 0.8) / (1 - 0.8))
p = 0.5

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is male is 0.5 or 50%.
