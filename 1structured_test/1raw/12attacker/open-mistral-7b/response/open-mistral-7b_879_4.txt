To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the city's gender distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. City's gender distribution: We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. Witness's accuracy in gender identification: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. In other words, there is a 0.8 probability of correct identification and a 0.2 probability of error.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we need to consider two scenarios:

a) The attacker is indeed male. In this case, the witness was correct. The probability of this scenario is 0.15 (the proportion of males in the city).

b) The attacker is female, but the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male. The probability of this scenario is 0.85 (the proportion of females in the city) times 0.2 (the probability of a witness error).

The total probability of the two scenarios is the sum of their probabilities:

P(Attacker is male) = P(Witness was correct) + P(Witness was incorrect but identified attacker as male)
P(Attacker is male) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.2
P(Attacker is male) = 0.15 + 0.17
P(Attacker is male) = 0.32

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 32%.
