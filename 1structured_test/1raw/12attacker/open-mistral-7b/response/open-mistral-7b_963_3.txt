Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as male, but their reliability in gender identification is only 80% accurate. They make mistakes 20% of the time.
3. Since we don't have any other information about the gender of the attacker, the only reasonable assumption we can make is that the gender distribution of the attackers in the city is the same as the gender distribution of the city's population.
4. Therefore, the probability of the witness's identification being correct (the attacker is male) is equal to the witness's success rate in gender identification, which is 80%.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.8} or 80%.
