Given the two pieces of information, we can make an estimate based on the reliability of the witness and the population statistics.

1. The population statistics give us that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, but they also make errors 20% of the time.
3. However, we know that the witness misidentified the attacker as male.

Since the population is heavily skewed towards female (85%), it's more likely that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker as male instead of correctly identifying a male attacker.

Let's denote:
- P(F) as the probability of a female attacker
- P(M) as the probability of a male attacker
- p as the witness's probability of correctly identifying a male attacker
- q as the witness's probability of incorrectly identifying a male attacker (1 - p)

The witness's statement gives us the following equation: q = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male)

However, the witness's ability to identify gender correctly is not given for only male individuals, but for the whole population. To account for this, we can adjust the probabilities based on the gender ratio in the city. So, we can assume that the witness's probability of correctly identifying a male is higher than 0.15 (since there are fewer males in the population), and their probability of incorrectly identifying a female as a male is lower than 0.85 (since there are more females in the population).

Let's assume that p > 0.15 and q < 0.85. Given that the witness misidentified the attacker as male, we have q > 0.1 (since the attacker must be male if the witness is correct).

Given these assumptions, it's more likely that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker as male (i.e., the attacker is female), as this would explain the low probability of a male attacker given the population statistics.

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is male should be lower than 0.15, but we cannot provide an exact number without further information.

{probability: less than 0.15, please note that this is an estimate based on the provided information and assumptions}
