To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given and apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's gender identification.

Let's denote:
- P(male) as the prior probability of the attacker being male
- P(female) as the prior probability of the attacker being female
- P(witness said male | male) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(witness said male | female) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male

From the information provided:
- P(male) + P(female) = 1 (the total probability of the attacker being either male or female)
- The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so P(witness said male | male) = 0.8
- The witness errs 20% of the time, so P(witness said male | female) = 0.2
- 85% of the population is female, so P(female) = 0.85

We don't have enough information to directly calculate P(male). However, we can use Bayes' theorem to find an estimate:

P(male | witness said male) = [P(witness said male | male) * P(male)] / [P(witness said male | male) * P(male) + P(witness said male | female) * P(female)]

Substituting the known values:

P(male | witness said male) = [0.8 * P(male)] / [0.8 * P(male) + 0.2 * 0.85]

Unfortunately, we still don't have enough information to calculate a specific value for P(male), as we need to know P(male) to complete the equation. However, we can provide some insights based on the information given:

- The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is slightly higher for males (80%) than for females (20% identified as male), which could suggest that the prior probability of the attacker being male is higher than 0.15 (the population percentage of males).
- Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief (P(male)) based on the new evidence (the witness's gender identification). The updated belief, P(male | witness said male), will be higher than P(male) if the witness's accuracy in identifying gender is better for males than for females, as is the case here.

In conclusion, based on the information provided, we cannot provide a specific numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is male, but we can infer that it is likely to be higher than 0.15.
