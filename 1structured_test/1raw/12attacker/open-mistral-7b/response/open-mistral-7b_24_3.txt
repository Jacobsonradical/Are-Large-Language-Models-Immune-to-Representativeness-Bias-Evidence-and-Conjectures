Given the information provided, there are two main sources of evidence: the population statistics and the witness's testimony.

1. Population statistics: The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. This information alone suggests that the attacker is likely female, as the majority of the population is female. However, this is not definitive since the attack occurred at night and the victim could not see the attacker's gender.

2. Witness testimony: The witness, who is not specified as having exceptional abilities in gender identification, correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time in similar conditions. In this case, the witness identified the attacker as male.

Since the population statistics suggest a female attacker but the witness testified to a male attacker, we must consider both pieces of evidence. The question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, so we will use the witness's testimony as our main source of evidence.

However, we must also account for the possibility of the witness's error. Given that the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, there is a 20% chance that the witness made an error in this case and the attacker is actually female.

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker) times (1 - 0.2) (the probability that the witness did not make an error in this case), which equals 0.64.

Therefore, {probability: 0.64} is our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the provided information.
