To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is female, we can assume that the witness errs in identifying females as males 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

However, we know that the witness identified the attacker as male. But we don't know whether the witness was correct or not, as the victim could not see the attacker's gender.

Given that the city has an 85% female population, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being male is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Since we don't know whether the witness was correct or not, we cannot use this information to adjust these probabilities. Therefore, the best estimate we can give for the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15, which is the actual male population percentage in the city.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.15}

This answer assumes that the witness's gender identification is not biased towards one gender or the other, and that the attacker's gender is not influenced by any other factors not mentioned in the information provided. If these assumptions are not valid, the probability estimate may need to be adjusted.
