To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. From the population distribution (information "a"), we know that 15% of the city's population is male.

2. However, we also have information "b" about the witness's ability to judge gender. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:
   a) The witness correctly identified a male attacker (80% chance).
   b) The witness erroneously identified a female as male (20% chance).

3. If scenario b) is true, it means that the actual attacker is female. In this case, the attacker being male has a probability of 0 (since there is no male attacker in this scenario).

4. Therefore, the overall probability that the attacker is male is the sum of the probabilities in scenario a) and the complementary probability of scenario b):
   {probability: 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker) + (1 - 0.2) * 0 (the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a female as male given that she actually identified a female attacker) = 0.8}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 80%.
