Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

From the information provided, we have:

- P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time when the person is male)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | not H) * P(not H)
  P(E | not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the gender 20% of the time when the person is female)
  P(not H) = 0.85 (the population is 85% female)

So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification:

P(H | E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.18 = 0.6111 (approximately 61.11%)

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability of the attacker being male is approximately 0.6111 (or 61.11%).
