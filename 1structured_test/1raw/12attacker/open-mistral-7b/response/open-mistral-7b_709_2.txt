To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence (the witness's statement).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence, which is the witness's statement

We are given two pieces of prior information:
1. The population demographics, which tells us P(H) = 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being male in the population)
2. The witness's reliability, which tells us that P(E|H) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker) and P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male)

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(E), which is the probability of the witness making the statement, regardless of the attacker's gender. This is because we don't have the total number of people the witness identified or the total number of times the witness made a correct or incorrect identification.

Therefore, we cannot provide a strict probability estimate based on the given information. But we can still qualitatively say that the witness's statement increases the likelihood of the attacker being male, given the demographics of the city.
