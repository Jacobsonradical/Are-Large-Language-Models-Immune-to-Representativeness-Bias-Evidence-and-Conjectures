To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's reliability in identifying gender is 80% (correctly identified) and 20% (incorrectly identified).

2. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

3. Since we don't have information about how many times the witness has identified a person's gender, we'll assume a single identification for simplicity.

4. Given the witness's reliability, there is a 80% chance that a correctly identified person is male, and a 20% chance that a correctly identified person is female.

5. However, since the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, there is a higher probability of encountering a female person than a male person.

6. To account for this, we can multiply the witness's correct identification probability for a male by the actual probability of encountering a male in the city and do the same for female.

7. For a male: 0.80 (witness's correct identification probability for male) * 0.15 (actual probability of encountering a male in the city) = 0.12

8. For a female: 0.20 (witness's correct identification probability for female) * 0.85 (actual probability of encountering a female in the city) = 0.17

9. The witness identified the attacker as male, so we are interested in the probability that the attacker is actually male given this identification.

10. The probability that the witness identified a male given that the attacker is indeed a male is 0.12.

11. The probability that the witness identified a female given that the attacker is actually a female is 0.17.

12. Since the witness identified a male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability of the witness identifying a male given that the attacker is indeed a male (0.12) divided by the sum of the probabilities that the witness identifies a male given that the attacker is actually a male and the probabilities that the witness identifies a female given that the attacker is actually a female (0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29).

13. The estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
