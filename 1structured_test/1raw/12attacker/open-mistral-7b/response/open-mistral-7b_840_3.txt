To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have specific information about the gender of the attacker, we should consider both the correct identification of a male attacker and the erroneous identification of a female attacker as evidence for the attacker being male.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 (80%). The probability of the witness erroneously identifying a female attacker as male is 0.15 * 0.2 (given that 15% of the population is male and the witness errs 20% of the time).

The total probability that the witness would identify an attacker as male, considering both correct and incorrect identifications, is the sum of these two probabilities:

Probability = 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.83 (83%).
