Given the information provided, we can approach this problem by calculating the prior probability of the attacker being male (since we know 85% of the population is female and 15% is male), and then adjusting this probability based on the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

Prior probability of the attacker being male: 0.15 (15%)

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 0.8 (80%), and they err 0.2 (20%) of the time. This means that when the witness is mistaken, they are more likely to identify a male as female (since there are more females in the population). To account for this, we can adjust the witness's correct identification rate for males downward.

Let's assume that, on average, the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female 50% of the time when they make an error. This means that when the witness thinks they've identified a male, there's a 50% chance it's actually a female and a 50% chance it's a male.

If the witness identifies the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is 0.5 (since the witness is likely wrong 50% of the time when they identify a male).

Given this, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is:

0.5 (probability that the witness is correct) * 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being male) + 0.5 (probability that the witness is mistaken and still identifying a male) * 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being male) * 0.5 (probability that the witness is mistaken and identifying a male who is actually a male)

Calculating this gives us:

0.075 + 0.0075 = 0.0825

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.0825 or 8.25%.
