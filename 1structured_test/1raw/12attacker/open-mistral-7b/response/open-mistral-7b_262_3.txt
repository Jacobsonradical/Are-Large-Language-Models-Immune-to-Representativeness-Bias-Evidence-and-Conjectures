Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider. The first piece of information (a) tells us that the witness, who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, identified the attacker as male. The second piece of information (b) tells us that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.

Since the witness's ability to identify gender is not perfect, and we don't know if the witness made an error in this particular case, we cannot take the witness's statement at face value. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the population statistics.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence E is equal to the probability of the evidence E given the event A, multiplied by the prior probability of the event A, divided by the probability of the evidence E:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / P(E)

In our case, A is the event that the attacker is male, E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male, and P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is male (which we want to find).

P(E|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker, which we know is 0.8 (80%).
P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which we want to find.
P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, which is the sum of P(E|A) and P(E|not A), where P(E|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, P(E|not A) = 0.2 (20%).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * P(A)] / [0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))]

Since we don't know P(A), we cannot provide a specific numerical value for P(A|E). However, we can rearrange the equation to solve for P(A) in terms of P(A|E):

P(A) = [P(A|E) * P(E)] / 0.8

Substituting the known values, we get:

P(A) = (P(A|E) * 0.8) / 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the population statistics, is proportional to P(A|E), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability that the attacker is male is also around 80%.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.8, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
