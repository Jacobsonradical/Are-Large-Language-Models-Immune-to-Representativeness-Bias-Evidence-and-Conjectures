To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's errors are more likely to be in favor of identifying males as females or vice versa. Let's assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the errors are equally distributed. This means that the witness mistakes a male for a female 10% of the time and a female for a male 10% of the time.

Given that the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of the witness seeing a male is 0.15 (15%). If the witness correctly identifies this male, the probability that the attacker is male is 1 (since the witness confirmed it). If the witness mistakenly identifies a female as a male, the probability of the attacker being male is still non-zero, but less than 1.

The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as a male is 0.10 (10%). Since the attacker is actually female in this case, the probability of the attacker being male, given this mistake, is 0 (since the witness's mistake means they can't provide any information about the attacker's gender).

So, the probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male plus the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as a male times the probability of the attacker being male given that mistake.

Using the given probabilities, this can be calculated as:

0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a male) + 0.10 * 0 (probability of the attacker being male given a mistake) = 0.8

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (or 80%). However, as mentioned earlier, this assumption of equal error distribution might not be accurate, and a more detailed analysis considering the specific error distribution could provide a more precise estimate.
