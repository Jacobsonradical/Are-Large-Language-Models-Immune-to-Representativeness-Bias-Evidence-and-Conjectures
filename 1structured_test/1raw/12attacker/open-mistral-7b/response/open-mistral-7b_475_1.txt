To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability.

1. According to the population statistics, 15% of the city's population is male.
2. However, the witness's reliability in identifying gender is only 80% accurate, meaning they err 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there's a 20% chance that they made an error. This means there's a 20% chance that the attacker is actually female, despite the witness's identification.
4. So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness being correct plus the probability of the witness being wrong and the attacker being male.
5. The probability of the witness being correct is 80%, and the probability of the witness being wrong and the attacker being male is the probability of the attacker being male in the population times the probability of the witness being wrong.
6. Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.
7. The probability of the witness being wrong and the attacker being male is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.
8. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83 or 83%.

So, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.83 (83%).
