Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B is given by P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A) is the prior probability of event A, P(B) is the probability of evidence B, and P(B|A) is the likelihood of evidence B given event A.

In this case, event A is the attacker being male, and evidence B is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we don't have direct information about. However, since we know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can estimate that P(A) = 0.15 (the probability of drawing a male from the population).

2. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, given that they are actually male. This is given to be 0.8 in the information.

3. P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, given that they are actually female. From the information, we know that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.2 (the probability of drawing a false positive).

4. P(A|B) is the probability we are interested in, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
      = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
      = 0.12 / 0.21
      = 0.5714

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.5714 or 57.14%.
