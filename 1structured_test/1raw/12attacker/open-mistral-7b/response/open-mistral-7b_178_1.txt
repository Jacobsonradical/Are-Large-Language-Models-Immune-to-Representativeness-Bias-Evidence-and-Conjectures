To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given and make some assumptions.

The first piece of information is that the city's population is 85% female and 15% male. This suggests that if we randomly choose a person from the city, they have a 15% chance of being male.

The second piece of information is that a witness, who is generally accurate in identifying gender, misidentified the attacker's gender 20% of the time. However, we don't know if this misidentification rate applies to situations where the witness cannot see the person clearly, like in the nighttime attack.

Given this uncertainty, it's not straightforward to update the initial probability based on the witness's testimony. We could assume that the witness's error rate remains the same, which would mean the actual probability of the attacker being male is higher than the initial 15%, but we don't have enough evidence to quantify this increase.

Therefore, while it's likely that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate based on the information given.
