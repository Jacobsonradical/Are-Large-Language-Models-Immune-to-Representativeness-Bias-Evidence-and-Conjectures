Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male (our target probability)
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female (1 - P(M))
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male (note that this should be low due to the witness's high accuracy)

The Bayes' theorem formula is:

P(M|w) = P(w|M) * P(M) / [P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)]

From the information provided, P(M) = 0.15, P(F) = 0.85, P(w|M) = 0.8, and P(w|F) = 0 (assuming the witness never mistakes a female for a male).

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(M|w) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.12 + 0 = 0.12

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12, or 12%. However, due to the witness's low accuracy in identifying gender at night, the actual probability might be higher, but the information provided does not allow us to estimate it accurately.
