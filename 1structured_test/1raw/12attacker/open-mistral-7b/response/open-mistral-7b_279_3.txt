Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

However, we don't have direct information about the gender distribution in the group the witness was observing. To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can make an assumption that the gender distribution in the group observed by the witness is similar to the city's population.

Given this assumption, we can calculate the probability of a false positive (witness identifying a female as male) and a false negative (witness identifying a male as female) to better understand the witness's testimony:

False positive probability (witness identifies a female as male) = 0.2 (error rate) * 0.85 (female proportion) = 0.17
False negative probability (witness identifies a male as female) = 0.2 (error rate) * 0.15 (male proportion) = 0.03

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we're interested in the probability that the attacker is actually male, given their gender identification by the witness. This probability is the complement of the false positive probability:

Probability of attacker being male = 1 - false positive probability = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.83.
