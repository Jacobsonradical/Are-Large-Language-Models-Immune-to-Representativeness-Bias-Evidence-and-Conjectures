To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the prior probability of the attacker being male as:

{probability: 0.15}

Now, let's consider the witness's reliability. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of this happening if the attacker is actually male is the witness's success rate:

{probability: 0.8}

However, the witness could also have made a mistake and identified a female attacker as male. The probability of this happening is the witness's error rate:

{probability: 0.2}

Since we don't know the actual gender of the attacker, we should consider both scenarios and their probabilities. The total probability of the witness identifying a male attacker (either correctly or by mistake) is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2}

Calculating the values, we get:

{probability: 0.12 + 0.17}

{probability: 0.29}

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%.
