Given the information provided, the population is 85% female and 15% male. However, a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender and errs 20% of the time identified the attacker as male. This means that the witness's identification of the attacker as male is likely to be correct more often than not, even if the population is heavily female.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male).

We know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If the population is 85% female and 15% male, then the probability of a random person being female is 0.85 and the probability of a random person being male is 0.15.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is actually male. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(male | witnessed as male) = P(witnessed as male | male) * P(male) / [P(witnessed as male | male) * P(male) + P(witnessed as male | not male) * P(not male)]

We know that P(witnessed as male | male) = 0.8 and P(witnessed as male | not male) = 0.2. To find P(male) and P(not male), we can use the given population distribution:

P(male) = 0.15
P(not male) = 0.85

Using these values in Bayes' theorem, we find:

P(male | witnessed as male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
