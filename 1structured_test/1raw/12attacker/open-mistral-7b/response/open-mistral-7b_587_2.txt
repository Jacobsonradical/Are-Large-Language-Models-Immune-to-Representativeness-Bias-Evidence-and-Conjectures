To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.

2. The gender distribution in the city: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Given these two pieces of information, we can calculate the probability that the witness misidentified a female as a male (Type I error) and misidentified a male as a female (Type II error).

Let F be the probability that the attacker is female and M be the probability that the attacker is male. We know that F = 0.85 and M = 0.15.

The probability that the witness identifies a female as a male is F * (1 - 0.8) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17, which is the probability of a Type I error.

The probability that the witness identifies a male as a female is M * 0.2 = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03, which is the probability of a Type II error.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies the gender is F * 0.8 + M * 0.2 = 0.85 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.68.

However, since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the probability that the witness correctly identified a male, which is M * 0.2 = 0.15.

The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the witnessed probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15.
