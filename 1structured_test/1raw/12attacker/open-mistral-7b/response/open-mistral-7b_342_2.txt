Given the information provided, we have two sources of information about the attacker's gender: the city's gender distribution and the witness's ability to accurately identify genders.

1. The city's gender distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's ability to identify genders: They correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

Let's break down the probability:

- There's a 15% chance that the attacker is male (information from the city's gender distribution).
- However, since the witness is not perfect, they might mistakenly identify a female as male or a male as female.

If we assume that the witness's error rate is random, we can calculate the probability that they would misidentify a female as male:

- Given that half the population is female, the witness would encounter a female 50% of the time.
- They incorrectly identify females as males 20% of the time.
- So, the probability that the witness mistakes a female for a male is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 (10%).

Now, if the witness identifies someone as male, we can't be 100% sure that it's the actual gender of the attacker. There's a chance that the witness made a mistake. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability:

- P(Male|Witness_Male) = P(Witness_Male|Male) * P(Male) / [P(Witness_Male|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness_Male|Female) * P(Female)]

Let's calculate the probabilities:

- P(Witness_Male|Male) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(Witness_Male|Female) = 0.1 (the witness mistakenly identifies females as males 10% of the time)
- P(Male) = 0.15
- P(Female) = 0.85

By substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

- P(Male|Witness_Male) ≈ 0.1 * (0.8) / [0.1 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85] ≈ 0.1 * 0.8 / 0.15 ≈ 0.533 (53.3%)

So, given the witness's ability to identify genders and the city's gender distribution, we estimate that there's a 53.3% chance that the attacker is male. Keep in mind that this is an estimation and depends on the assumptions made about the witness's error rate and the attacker's gender distribution.
