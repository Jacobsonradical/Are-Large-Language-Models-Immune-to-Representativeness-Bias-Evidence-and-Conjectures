To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement and the city's gender distribution.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (witness statement and city's gender distribution)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

1. P(E | H): This is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male. From the information provided, we know that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, P(E | H) = 0.8.

2. P(H): This is the prior probability of the hypothesis. Since we have no information about the gender of the attacker before the witness statement, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being male is the same as the proportion of males in the city. Since 15% of the population is male, P(H) = 0.15.

3. P(E): This is the probability of the evidence. Since the witness statement and the city's gender distribution are independent, we can calculate this by multiplying the probabilities of each part of the evidence. The probability of the witness statement being true is P(E | H) = 0.8, and the probability of the city's gender distribution is P(H) = 0.15. So, P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) = 0.12.

4. P(H | E): This is what we want to find. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate it as: P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.12) = 0.667

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.667 (or 66.7%). This means that, given the evidence and assuming the witness's accuracy is representative, there is a 66.7% chance that the attacker is male.
