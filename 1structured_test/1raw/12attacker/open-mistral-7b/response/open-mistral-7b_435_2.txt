To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and the reliability of the witness's gender identification.

Let's denote the actual gender of the attacker as A (male or female), and the witness's identification as W (male or female). We have two pieces of information:

1) The population ratio of males to females is 15% to 85%. So, P(A=male) = 0.15 and P(A=female) = 0.85.

2) The witness misidentifies gender 20% of the time, and correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. So, if A=male, P(W=male|A=male) = 0.8, and if A=female, P(W=male|A=female) = 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed male given this identification (conditional probability):

P(A=male|W=male) = P(W=male|A=male) * P(A=male) / [P(W=male|A=male) * P(A=male) + P(W=male|A=female) * P(A=female)]

Plugging in the numbers:

P(A=male|W=male) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculate the expression to get:

P(A=male|W=male) â‰ˆ 0.21

So, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 21%.
