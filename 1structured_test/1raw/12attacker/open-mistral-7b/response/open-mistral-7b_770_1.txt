To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

From the provided information, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. However, a witness reported seeing a male attacker. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they make an error 20% of the time.

Given that we cannot directly apply the witness's error rate to this situation, let's consider the scenario where the witness's gender identification is perfect (100% accurate). In this case, if the attacker was indeed male, the witness would correctly identify the attacker as such.

On the other hand, if the attacker was female, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as male due to their 20% error rate. Since the city's population is predominantly female (85%), the probability of the attacker being female in this perfect scenario would be higher than the actual 15% male population proportion.

To find this probability, we can calculate the expected value (probability-weighted sum) of the witness's error rate and the perfect scenario's estimated probability of the attacker being female:

Expected probability of attacker being female = (1 - 15%) * 0 + 15% * (1 - 0.8) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03

Since the witness reported a male attacker, the actual probability of the attacker being male is 1 minus the expected probability of the attacker being female:

Probability of attacker being male = 1 - 0.03 = 0.97

However, since we cannot assume the witness's gender identification is perfect, we need to account for their 20% error rate. To do this, we can multiply the probability of the attacker being male in the perfect scenario by the witness's accuracy in gender identification:

Adjusted probability of attacker being male = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

In summary, based on the provided information and considering the witness's gender identification reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12, or 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is subject to the assumptions and limitations of the given information.
