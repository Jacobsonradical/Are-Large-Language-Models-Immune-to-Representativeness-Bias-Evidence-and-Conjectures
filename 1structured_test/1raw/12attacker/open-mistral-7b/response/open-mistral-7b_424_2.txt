To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume that the witness saw the attacker and their gender was indeed male (M). The probability of this happening is 0.15 (the probability of drawing a male from the population).

If the witness correctly identifies the gender, then the probability is 0.8. If the witness errs, they will incorrectly identify a female as male, which happens 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the probability of drawing a female from the population and being incorrectly identified as male by the witness).

So, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, and the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female as male is 0.17.

The total probability that the witness identified a male (M) is therefore 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

However, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is actually male, not just the probability that the witness identified them as such. The probability that the attacker is male is the same as the probability of drawing a male from the population, which is 0.15.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.15}.
