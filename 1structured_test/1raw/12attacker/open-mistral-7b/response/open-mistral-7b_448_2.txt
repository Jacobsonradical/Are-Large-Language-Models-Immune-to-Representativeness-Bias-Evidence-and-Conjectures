To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and is used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male (H), and the evidence is the witness's statement (E). The prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)) is the probability of the attacker being male before considering the evidence, and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male.

The probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (P(E|~H)) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female. The posterior probability of the hypothesis (P(H|E)) is what we are trying to find.

From the given information, we have:

1. P(H) = Probability of the attacker being male = Unknown
2. P(~H) = Probability of the attacker being female = 1 - P(H)
3. P(E|H) = Probability of witness correctly identifying a male = 0.8
4. P(E|~H) = Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a male = 0.2

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

We don't have the value of P(H), so we can't provide an exact number. However, we do have information about the gender distribution in the city (b). Since the witness's error rate is independent of the gender distribution in the city, we can assume that the prior probability of the attacker being male is approximately equal to the gender distribution in the city.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can estimate P(H) as 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 12%. It's important to note that this is an estimate and that the actual probability might be different. The accuracy of this estimate depends on the assumption that the prior probability is equal to the gender distribution in the city.
