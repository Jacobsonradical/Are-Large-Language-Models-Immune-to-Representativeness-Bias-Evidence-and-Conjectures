Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population statistics suggest that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male.
2. The witness's ability to determine gender accurately is 80%, but they also make mistakes 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male, but the victim could not see the attacker's gender.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's gender, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker's gender is not known with certainty. However, the witness's identification adds some additional information.

If the witness's identification is accurate, then the attacker is male. If the witness's identification is incorrect, then the attacker could be either male or female, as the witness's error rate is 20%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed male by considering both the probability of the witness's identification being correct and the population statistics.

If the witness's identification is correct, the probability that the attacker is male is 1 (since the witness confirmed it). If the witness's identification is incorrect, the probability that the attacker is male is the probability of the witness making an error times the probability that the attacker is actually male in the population.

The probability of the witness making an error is 0.2, and the probability that the attacker is male in the population is 0.15 (from the population statistics). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given an incorrect witness identification is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Since the witness's identification was actually made, the overall probability that the attacker is male is the probability of the witness's identification being correct plus the probability of the witness's identification being incorrect times the probability that the attacker is male given an incorrect identification.

The probability of the witness's identification being correct is 0.8, and the probability that the attacker is male given an incorrect identification is 0.03. Therefore, the overall probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * 0.03 = 0.83.

In summary, given the population statistics and the witness's identification, we estimate that the probability that the attacker is male is 0.83.
