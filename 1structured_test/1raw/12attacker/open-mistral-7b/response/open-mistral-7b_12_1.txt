Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time.
2. The attacker's gender was not observed directly by the victim, but was determined by a witness who was 80% accurate.
3. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's gender identification.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male

We are given:
- P(w|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(F) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
- P(M) + P(F) = 1

The goal is to find P(M).

We know that P(M) * P(w|M) = P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)

Substituting the known values, we get:

P(M) * 0.8 = 0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * 0.15

Solving for P(M):

0.8 * P(M) = 0.8 * P(M) + 0.03

0.8 * P(M) = 0.03

P(M) = 0.03 / 0.8

After simplifying, we get P(M) = 0.0375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.0375 or 3.75%. This is a very low probability, given the large female population in the city. However, it's important to note that this estimation relies on the assumption that the witness's ability to judge gender is independent of the actual gender of the person, which may not always be the case.
