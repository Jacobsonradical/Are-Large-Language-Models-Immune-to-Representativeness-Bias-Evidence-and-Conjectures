Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. However, we need to account for the fact that 85% of the population in the city is female, which means there are more females for the witness to mistake for males.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as p. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is p, and the probability of the witness erring and identifying a female as male is 0.15*p (since there is a 15% chance of encountering a male).

The probability of the witness erring and identifying a male as female is 0.15*(1-p) (since there is a 15% chance of encountering a male and a 85% chance of encountering a female).

The witness identified the attacker as male, so the probability of this event happening is p + 0.15*p = 1.15p.

The probability of this event happening by chance (the witness erring and identifying a female as male) is 0.15*(1-p).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write an equation: p + 0.15*p = 0.8 * (1 - 0.15*p) + 0.2 * 0.15*p

Simplifying the equation, we get: 1.15p = 0.65 - 0.0225p

Solving for p, we get: p = 0.5714

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.5714 or 57.14%.
