To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is male.
- E: The evidence that a witness identified the attacker as male.
- P(H): Prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to find.
- P(E|H): Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- P(E|~H): Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male.
- P(~H): Prior probability of the attacker not being male.

From the information provided, we can calculate the following probabilities:

1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (Given that the attacker is male, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time.)
2. P(E|~H) = 0.2 (Given that the attacker is not male, the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time.)
3. P(H) + P(~H) = 1 (The probability of the attacker being male and not being male must add up to 1.)

From the third piece of information provided, we can calculate P(~H):

4. P(~H) = 1 - P(H)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(H):

P(H) = [P(E|H) * P(~H)] / [P(E|H) * P(~H) + P(E|~H) * P(H)]

Substituting the calculated values:

P(H) = [0.8 * (1 - P(H))] / [0.8 * (1 - P(H)) + 0.2 * P(H)]

Unfortunately, we do not have enough information to directly calculate P(~H), so we cannot calculate P(H) directly. However, we can make an assumption about P(~H) and then calculate P(H).

Since 85% of the population is female, a reasonable assumption would be that P(~H) is close to 0.15. Let's use P(~H) = 0.15 as our assumption.

If P(~H) = 0.15, then P(H) = 0.47

Therefore, under the assumption that P(~H) = 0.15, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.47. This means that, given the witness's ability to judge gender and the gender distribution in the city, the attacker is estimated to be male 47% of the time.
