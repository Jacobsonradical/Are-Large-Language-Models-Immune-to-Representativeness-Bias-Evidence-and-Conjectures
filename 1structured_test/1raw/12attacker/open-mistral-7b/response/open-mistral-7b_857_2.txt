To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, which allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

First, we need to calculate the prior probability P(H), which is the probability that the attacker is male before considering the evidence. Given that we don't have any prior information, we can assume that P(H) = P(not H) = 0.5 (since 0.5 of the population is male and 0.5 is female).

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis P(E|H). The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.

Similarly, we need to calculate the likelihood of the evidence given the opposite hypothesis P(E|not H). Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(E|not H) = 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]

Now, let's calculate the denominator:

[0.8 * 0.5] + [0.2 * 0.5] = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

So, P(H|E) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8, or 80%.
