To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory, which allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's gender judgment, and the event of interest is whether the attacker is male or female.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

In this context:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male
- ~A: The attacker is female

From the information provided, we have the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = Probability that the attacker is male. This is the probability we want to estimate.
2. P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = Probability that the attacker is female.
3. P(B|A) = The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male is 0.8 or 80%.
4. P(B|~A) = The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 or 3%.
5. P(B) = The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male can be calculated as the sum of P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.03 * P(~A)

Given that 85% of the population in the city is female, P(~A) = 0.85. We can then solve for P(A) using Bayes' theorem and the calculated value for P(B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * P(A)] / [0.8 * P(A) + 0.03 * 0.85]

To find the estimated probability P(A|B), we need to solve this equation for P(A). Unfortunately, without additional information, we cannot provide a numerical value for P(A|B). However, we can say that given the witness's gender judgment and the gender distribution in the city, the attacker is more likely to be male than female, but the exact probability cannot be determined based on this information alone.
