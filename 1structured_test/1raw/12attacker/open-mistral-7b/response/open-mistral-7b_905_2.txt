Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as male with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is female as P(F) and the probability that the attacker is male as P(M).

From the witness's statements, we know that when they observe a random person from the city, they misidentify the gender 20% of the time. This means that when they see a female, they incorrectly identify her as male 20% of the time, and when they see a male, they incorrectly identify him as female 20% of the time.

Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of the witness observing a female is 0.85, and the probability of observing a male is 0.15.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness misidentifies a female as a male: P(Witness misidentifies F as M) = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

Similarly, the probability that the witness misidentifies a male as a female: P(Witness misidentifies M as F) = 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we know that either the attacker is indeed male (P(M)), or the witness misidentified a female as male (P(Witness misidentifies F as M)).

So, we have the following equation: P(M) + P(Witness misidentifies F as M) = 1

Substituting the values we calculated, we get: P(M) + 0.17 = 1

Solving for P(M), we find that the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.83 (83%), assuming that the witness's ability to judge gender is consistent with their reported accuracy.
