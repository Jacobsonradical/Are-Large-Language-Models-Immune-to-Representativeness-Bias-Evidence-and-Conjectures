Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The population distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness, who is not perfect in identifying gender, mistakenly identified as male 20% of the time when the actual gender was female.

The witness identified the attacker as male, which means they either correctly identified a male attacker or mistakenly identified a female attacker as male.

Let's denote the probability of a male attacker as M and the probability of a female attacker as F. We know that M + F = 1 (since there are only two possible genders).

The witness's statement that the attacker is male gives us the equation M â‰¥ 0.5 (since the population is majority female).

The statement about the witness's accuracy gives us the equation M = 0.2 * F + 0.8 * M (because the witness mistakes female for male 20% of the time).

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by (1 - 0.2) to get:

M = 0.6 * F + 0.8 * M

Rearranging terms, we get:

0.4 * M = 0.6 * F

Since M + F = 1, we can substitute F = 1 - M into the equation:

0.4 * M = 0.6 * (1 - M)

Solving for M, we get:

M = 0.4 / 0.8 = 0.5

However, since M must be greater than or equal to 0.5 (given the population distribution), the minimum possible value for M is 0.5.

Therefore, based on the given information, the minimum probability that the attacker is male is 0.5.
