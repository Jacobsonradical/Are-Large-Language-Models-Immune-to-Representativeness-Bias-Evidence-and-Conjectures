To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the witness's error resulted in misidentifying a male as female or vice versa, we can assume that the error rate is equal for both genders (as the witness's error rate is given as a percentage, not biased towards one gender).

Given this, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8 (80%). Since 15% of the population is male, the probability of the attacker being male is the product of the witness's accuracy and the percentage of males in the population.

So, the probability of the attacker being male is:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%}

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 12%.
