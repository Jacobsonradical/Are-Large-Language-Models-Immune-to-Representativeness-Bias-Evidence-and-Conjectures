To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness's ability to accurately identify gender.

1. The general population distribution: In the city, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's ability to accurately identify gender: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

a) The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender. In this case, the attacker is indeed male.

b) The witness made an error in identifying the attacker's gender. In this case, the attacker is actually female (since the city has a higher percentage of females).

Now, let's calculate the probabilities for both scenarios:

a) Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender (male): Given that 15% of the population is male, the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker is 15%.

b) Probability of the witness making an error and the attacker being female: Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male is 20% (witness's error rate). Since we know that the witness identified the attacker as male, this scenario implies that the attacker is actually female.

Now we can compute the overall probability of the attacker being male, considering both scenarios:

{probability: 0.15 (15%), since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male in 15% of the cases}
