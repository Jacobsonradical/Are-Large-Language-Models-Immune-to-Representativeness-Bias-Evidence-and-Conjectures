To answer this question, we need to consider two factors: the gender distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying genders.

1. The gender distribution in the city: We know that 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's accuracy in identifying genders: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness errs in two ways: misidentifying a male as female and misidentifying a female as male. Since the gender distribution is 85:15, we would expect more errors in misidentifying males as females than the other way around, given that there are more females in the city.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can consider this a correct identification if the attacker is actually male or an error if the attacker is female. To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the initial gender distribution and the witness's error rate.

Let's assume that the actual gender of the attacker is X (either male or female), and the witness's identification is Y (either male or female as well). We want to find P(X=male|Y=male), where m is the event "the attacker is male."

Given that the gender distribution is 85:15, we can assume that the probability of a random person being female is 0.85 and the probability of a random person being male is 0.15. We know that the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

So, if the attacker is male (X=male), the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male (Y=male) is P(Y=male|X=male) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time).

However, if the attacker is female (X=female), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male (Y=male) is P(Y=male|X=female) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (since the witness errs in identifying a female as male 3% of the time, and there are 15% females in the city).

Since we don't have any information about the actual gender of the attacker, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:

P(X=male|Y=male) = P(Y=male|X=male) * P(X=male) / (P(Y=male|X=male) * P(X=male) + P(Y=male|X=female) * P(X=female))

Plugging in the probabilities:

P(X=male|Y=male) = (0.8) * (0.15) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.03) * (0.85)) = 0.1224

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 12.24%. However, since the witness's identification is not perfect and there is a significant gender imbalance in the city, this probability is likely lower than the actual gender distribution. The true probability may be closer to the 15% male distribution in the city.
