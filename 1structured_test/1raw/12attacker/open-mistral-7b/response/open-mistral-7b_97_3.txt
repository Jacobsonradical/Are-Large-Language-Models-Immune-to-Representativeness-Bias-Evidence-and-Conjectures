To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as p and the probability of the attacker being female as 1-p.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we can assume that the witness's error rate (mistaking a female for a male or vice versa) is 20%. This means that when the witness sees a male, they mistakenly identify him as female only 20% of the time, and when they see a female, they mistakenly identify her as male 20% of the time.

The witness identifies the attacker as male, so we can represent this event as "Witness sees a male and correctly identifies him" or "Witness sees a male and mistakes a female for a male." Let's denote these two events as A and B, respectively.

The probability of event A (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male) is p. The probability of event B (the witness mistakes a female for a male) is 0.2 * (1-p) = 0.2 - 0.2p.

Since the witness identifies the attacker as male, we can write:

p + 0.2 - 0.2p = 0.8

Solving for p, we get:

p = 0.6

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.6 or 60%.
