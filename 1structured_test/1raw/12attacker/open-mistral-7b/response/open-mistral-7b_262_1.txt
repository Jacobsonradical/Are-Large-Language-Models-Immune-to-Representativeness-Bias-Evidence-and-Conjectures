To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and is used to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case, A is the event "the attacker is male" and B is the evidence "the witness identified the attacker as male".

From the information provided, we have:
1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to find.
2. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is given as 0.8 (80%).
3. P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which we can find by subtracting the probability of correctly identifying a male from 1 (since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time). So, P(B|~A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20%).
4. P(A) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(~A) * P(B|~A) = [P(A) * 0.8] + [(1-P(A)) * 0.2]

We know that the population is 85% female and 15% male, so the prior probability of the attacker being male is P(A) = 0.15 (15%).

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

0.15 * 0.8 + (1-0.15) * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.06 = 0.18

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the evidence, is 0.18 or 18%.
