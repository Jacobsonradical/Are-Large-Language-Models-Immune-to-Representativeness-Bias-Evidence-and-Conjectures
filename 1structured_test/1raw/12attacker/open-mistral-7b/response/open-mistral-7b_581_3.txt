Given the information provided, let's assume that the gender of the attacker is a random event with two possible outcomes: male or female. The witness's ability to correctly identify the gender of a person is not 100%, but rather 80% for this specific witness.

The probability of the witness making a mistake (erring) in identifying the gender is therefore 20%. However, we don't know if the witness made a mistake in this particular case or not, as we only know that the witness identified the attacker as male.

The second piece of information states that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This could potentially influence the likelihood of the attacker being male, but we cannot use this information directly to estimate the probability that the attacker is male, because the witness's report is not influenced by the population distribution.

Therefore, without knowing if the witness made a mistake or not, we cannot provide a strict estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. The witness's statement alone provides a 80% probability that the attacker is male, but without more information, we cannot say for certain if the witness was correct or not.

Answer: {probability: cannot be determined based on the given information}
