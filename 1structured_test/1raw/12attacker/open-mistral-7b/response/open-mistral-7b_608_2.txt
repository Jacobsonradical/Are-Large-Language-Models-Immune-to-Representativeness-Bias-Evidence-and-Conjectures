Given the information provided, the population ratio of males to females is 15% to 85%. However, we also have information about the witness's ability to correctly identify gender. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as male. If we assume that the witness's mistakes are equally likely to err in identifying a male as a female, then the probability that the witness is correct in identifying a male is equal to the witness's success rate (80%).

However, we need to account for the fact that the population is heavily female (85%). If the witness is incorrect, it is more likely that they have mistaken a female for a male than the other way around, given the population ratio.

Therefore, to calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's success rate and the population ratio. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(M).

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(M):

P(M) = P(Witness said male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) / P(Witness said male)

We are given P(Witness said male | Attacker is male) = 0.8
P(Attacker is male) = 0.15 (from the population ratio)

To find P(Witness said male), we need to consider both the correct identifications and the errors. The probability of the witness saying "male" when the attacker is male is 0.8. The probability of the witness saying "male" when the attacker is female is 0.2 * 0.8 (since the witness errs 20% of the time and is more likely to err in identifying a female as a male).

So, P(Witness said male) = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.8 + 0.16 = 0.96

Now, we can calculate P(M):

P(M) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.96 = 0.12

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 12%.
