Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. Since we don't have any specific information about the attacker's gender, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being male or female is equal (50% each).

When the witness makes a judgment, they are incorrect 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker is actually female, the witness will mistakenly identify them as male 20% of the time. Conversely, if the attacker is male, the witness will mistakenly identify them as female 20% of the time.

The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, which means that when the attacker is actually male, the witness correctly identifies them as male 80% of the time. So, the probability that the attacker is male given a correct identification by the witness is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, the information we have also tells us that the witness errs 20% of the time. When the attacker is actually male, this means that the witness mistakenly identifies them as female 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given an incorrect identification by the witness is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

Given that the witness has identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is the probability of the attacker being male given a correct identification by the witness, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.8}.
