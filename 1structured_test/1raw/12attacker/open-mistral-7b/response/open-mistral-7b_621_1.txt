To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory dealing with conditional probability and is expressed as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case,
- A is the event that the attacker is male,
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
- P(A) (the prior probability) is the proportion of males in the population, which is 15% (0.15).
- P(B|A) (the likelihood) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is 0.8 (from information "a").
- P(B|~A) (the error probability) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 0.2 (from information "a").
- P(~A) (the complementary probability) is the proportion of females in the population, which is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.
- P(B) (the marginal probability) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as male, which can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.619

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.619 or 61.9%.
