Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case, event A is the attacker being male, and evidence B is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

1. We are given that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male).
2. We are also given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker) and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).
3. The total probability of the witness's identification, P(B), is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A): P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.34 or 34%.
