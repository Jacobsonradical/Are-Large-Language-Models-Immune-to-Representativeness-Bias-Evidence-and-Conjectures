Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the reliability of the witness and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. However, we don't know if the witness's error rate is biased towards misidentifying females as males or males as females.
4. Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, it's not possible to determine if this was a correct identification or an error.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot make a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. The witness's identification alone does not provide enough information to take into account the city's gender distribution or the witness's error rate.
