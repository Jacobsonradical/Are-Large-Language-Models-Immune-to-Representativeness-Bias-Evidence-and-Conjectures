Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's error rate.

If the attacker is actually female, the witness would mistakenly identify them as male 20% of the time. Since the population is 85% female, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85.

The probability of the attacker being male is then the complement of the probability of the attacker being female, which is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

However, the witness identified the attacker as male, so we need to account for this. The witness's identification is correct if the attacker is actually male and incorrect if the attacker is female. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and there is a 15% chance that the attacker is male, the probability that the witness's identification is correct given that the attacker is male is 0.80.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the probability that the witness's identification is correct times the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's correct identification: 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Therefore, based on the witness's identification and their error rate, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12, or 12%.
