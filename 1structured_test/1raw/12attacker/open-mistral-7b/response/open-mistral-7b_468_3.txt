To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given and apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is male.
- E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the information given, we have:
P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male)
P(~H) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female)

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is given by:
P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12 or 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes the witness's ability to judge gender is independent of the attacker's identity, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios.
