To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we first need to understand the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time.
2. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possibilities:

a) The attacker is actually male. In this case, the probability of the witness's correct identification is 0.8 (80%).
b) The attacker is actually female. In this case, the probability of the witness's incorrect identification is 0.2 (20%).

Since we only have the information that the witness identified the attacker as male, we cannot directly use the probability of the attacker being female (b). Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male (a) given the witness's identification:

P(A = male | W) = P(W | A = male) * P(A = male) / [P(W | A = male) * P(A = male) + P(W | A = female) * P(A = female)]

where:
- P(A = male) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (15%),
- P(W | A = male) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (0.8),
- P(W | A = female) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male (0.2), and
- P(W) is the probability of the witness's identification (the witness identified the attacker as male).

Calculating the probability P(W) by Bayes' theorem again:

P(W) = P(W | A = male) * P(A = male) + P(W | A = female) * P(A = female)

Substituting the given values:

P(W) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)

Now we can calculate the probability P(A = male | W):

P(A = male | W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

The estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.26 or 26%.
