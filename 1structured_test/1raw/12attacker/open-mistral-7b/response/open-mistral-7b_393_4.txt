To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. We know that 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80% for males and 20% for females when the conditions are similar to the night of the attack.

Let's assume that the attacker's true gender is X (either male or female). The probability of the witness identifying X as male is P(M|X), and the probability of the witness identifying X as female is P(F|X).

We have two pieces of information:

a) P(M) = 0.15 (probability of a male in the population)
b) The witness correctly identifies genders as follows:
   - P(M|M) = 0.8 (probability of the witness identifying a male as male)
   - P(F|M) = 0.2 (probability of the witness identifying a male as female)
   - P(M|F) = 0.2 (probability of the witness identifying a female as male)
   - P(F|F) = 0.8 (probability of the witness identifying a female as female)

Since we don't know the attacker's gender, we want to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, P(M|X). We can express this probability as a weighted average of P(M|M) and P(M|F) based on the true gender proportion:

P(M|X) = P(X=M) * P(M|M) + P(X=F) * P(M|F)

We can substitute:
- P(M) = 0.15
- P(M|M) = 0.8
- P(M|F) = 0.2

Now, we need to find P(X=F) to complete the equation:

P(X=F) = 1 - P(X=M)
P(X=F) = 1 - 0.15
P(X=F) = 0.85

Now, we can solve for P(M|X):

P(M|X) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.29 or 29%. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate and may not reflect the actual probability due to various factors, including the specific conditions of the attack and the witness's observation abilities.
