Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: the gender distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender.

1. The population distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, the second piece of information introduces a complication. The witness's accuracy is based on a sample of people that is equal parts male and female. But in the real world, the city's population is not equally divided between males and females.

Let's say we want to avoid relying on the witness's identification and instead use the city's gender distribution to make an estimate. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, and we don't want to incorporate that uncertainty into our estimate, we can adjust the city's gender distribution to account for the witness's errors.

If we assume that the witness always errs in favoring the majority gender, we can subtract the witness's error rate from the majority gender's proportion. Here, the majority gender is female (85%). So, the adjusted proportion of females is 85% - 20% * 85% = 0.689 (or 68.9%).

Now, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is male by subtracting the adjusted proportion of females from 1: 1 - 0.689 = 0.311 (or 31.1%).

However, this estimate relies on the assumption that the witness always errs in favor of the majority gender, which may not be accurate. It would be more accurate to use Bayes' theorem to incorporate the witness's information into the estimate, but we don't have enough information to do that.

Therefore, I will provide two estimates:

1. Using the city's gender distribution and assuming the witness always errs in favor of the majority gender: {probability: 0.311}
2. Without making assumptions about the witness's errors: {probability: Unable to estimate}
