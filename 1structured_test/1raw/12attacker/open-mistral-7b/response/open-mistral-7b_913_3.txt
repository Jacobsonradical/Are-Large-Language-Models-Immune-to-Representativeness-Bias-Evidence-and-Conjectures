To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. The population distribution: We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness has identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

a) The witness is correct, and the attacker is actually male.
b) The witness is wrong, and the attacker is female.

The probability of scenario a) is the probability that the attacker is male in the general population (0.15) multiplied by the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker (0.8).

The probability of scenario b) is the probability that the attacker is female in the general population (0.85) multiplied by the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female attacker as male (0.2).

The probability that the witness is correct (scenario a) is the probability of scenario a) divided by the total probability of both scenarios a and b.

So, we can write this as:

P(attacker is male | witness's statement) = P(attacker is male) * P(witness correctly identifies male) / (P(attacker is male) * P(witness correctly identifies male) + P(attacker is female) * P(witness mistakenly identifies female as male))

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(attacker is male | witness's statement) = 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2)

P(attacker is male | witness's statement) â‰ˆ 0.276

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 27.6%.
