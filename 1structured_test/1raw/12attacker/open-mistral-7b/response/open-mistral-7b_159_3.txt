Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender: 80% of the time.
2. The gender distribution in the city: 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:

- A: The attacker is male
- ¬A: The attacker is not male (female)
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as male

From the information given, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (the population is 85% female)
P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(E|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

After calculating, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.224 or 22.4%.
