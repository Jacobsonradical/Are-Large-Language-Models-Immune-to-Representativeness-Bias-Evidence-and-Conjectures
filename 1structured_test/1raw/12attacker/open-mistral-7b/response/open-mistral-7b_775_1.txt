To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the new evidence is the witness's statement and the city's gender demographics.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the attacker is male),
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the witness's statement and the city's gender demographics),
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.

Let's break down each part:

1. Prior probability: P(H) = 15% (based on city demographics)
2. Evidence: E = The witness identified the attacker as male and was correct 80% of the time. This can be represented as P(E|H) = 0.8.
3. We don't have enough information to calculate P(E|~H) (the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is female). However, we can assume that the witness is equally bad at identifying genders when they are female. In this case, P(E|~H) = 0.2.
4. We can calculate P(E) as the sum of the probabilities of the evidence given each hypothesis: P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the evidence:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48

So, based on the witness's statement and the city's gender demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
