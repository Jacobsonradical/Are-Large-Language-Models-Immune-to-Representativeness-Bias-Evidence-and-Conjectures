Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B is equal to the probability of B given A times the prior probability of A divided by the probability of B.

Let's define our events and probabilities:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

From the first piece of information, we know the witness's ability to correctly identify gender: P(A|B) = 0.8, P(not A|B) = 0.2

From the second piece of information, we know the gender distribution in the city: P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male), P(not A) = 0.85 (the population is 85% female)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.168

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.7172

So, based on the information given, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.7172 or 71.72%.
