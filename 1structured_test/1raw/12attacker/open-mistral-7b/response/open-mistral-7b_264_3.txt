To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender demographics of the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). We know that the witness mistakes gender 20% of the time, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of picking a female at random is 0.85, and the probability of picking a male at random is 0.15.

The witness's observed gender distribution in their 50%/50% sample should be similar to the city's gender distribution. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male in the sample is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The witness's observed gender distribution in their 50%/50% sample should also reflect the actual gender distribution in the city. So, the probability of the witness misidentifying a male as female in their sample is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a male and the probabilities of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male:

P(male) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15, or 15%.
