Given the information provided, we have two sources of data to consider. The first source (a) states that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. The second source (b) tells us that a witness, who is accurate in identifying gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.

However, it's important to note that the witness's identification is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the actual gender of the attacker, especially since the attack occurred in the dark and the witness may not have had a clear view.

The probability of the attacker being male based solely on the city's demographic data (source a) is 0.15, or 15%. This is the proportion of males in the city.

The probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's identification (source b) is a bit more complex. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we would expect that 20% of the time when the witness identifies someone as male, they are actually mistaken and the person is female. This means that 80% of the time when the witness identifies someone as male, they are correct.

So, if we assume that the witness's identification is a reliable indicator of the attacker's gender, then the probability of the attacker being male is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, as mentioned earlier, the witness's identification is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the attacker's gender. Therefore, a more conservative estimate would be to consider the two sources of data as independent pieces of information, and use a weighted average to estimate the probability of the attacker being male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P. Then, we can write two equations:

1) P = 0.15 (based on city demographics)
2) 0.8P + 0.2(1-P) = probability of witness identifying attacker as male (based on witness's accuracy)

Solving these equations gives us an estimated probability of the attacker being male of P = 0.22, or 22%.

Therefore, based on the available information, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.22 (or 22%). However, this estimate is subject to uncertainty and should be interpreted with caution.
