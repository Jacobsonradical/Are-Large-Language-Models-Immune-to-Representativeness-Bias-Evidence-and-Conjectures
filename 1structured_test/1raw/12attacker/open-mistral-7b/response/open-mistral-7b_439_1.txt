To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the witness's reliability.

The population statistics indicate that 15% of the city's population is male. However, due to the witness's error rate, we cannot directly use this percentage as our estimate.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. This means they make an error 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be misidentifying a male as female or vice versa, then the probability of the witness erring in a specific case is 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there is a 0.8 probability that they correctly identified the attacker's gender and a 0.2 probability that they made an error. In the case of an error, the attacker's actual gender is the opposite of the witness's statement, which means the attacker is female.

Given that we are interested in the probability that the attacker is male, we can calculate this probability as the probability of the witness making a correct identification plus the probability of the witness making an error and the attacker being male, which is the probability of the attacker being male given a false positive:

Probability of attacker being male = Probability of correct identification + Probability of error and attacker being male
                                                 = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.15
                                                 = 0.8 + 0.03
                                                 = 0.83

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.83.
