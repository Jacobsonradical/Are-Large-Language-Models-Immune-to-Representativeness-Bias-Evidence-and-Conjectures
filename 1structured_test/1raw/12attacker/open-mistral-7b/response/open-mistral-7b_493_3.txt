Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

First, let's understand the significance of the witness's accuracy in identifying gender. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the true gender of a person is known, the witness will correctly identify it 80% of the time and mistakenly identify it as the opposite gender 20% of the time.

However, we don't know the true gender of the attacker, so we need to consider both possibilities (attacker is male or female) and the probabilities of the witness's incorrect identification.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M) and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F) = 1 - P(M).

Given the witness's accuracy, if the attacker is male (P(M)), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as female is 0.2 (the 20% error rate). Similarly, if the attacker is female (P(F)), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as male is also 0.2.

The witness identified the attacker as male, and the court found this identification to be reliable. This means that the witness's identification should correspond more to the true gender of the attacker than to the 20% error rate. Therefore, we can assume that the probability of the witness's incorrect identification (0.2) is less than the actual probability of the attacker being female (P(F)).

Since 85% of the population in the city is female, it's reasonable to assume that P(F) > 0.85. However, we don't have enough information to calculate an exact value for P(F).

Given this information, we cannot provide a precise probability for P(M). However, we can say that the probability that the attacker is male is likely to be less than 0.85, and the probability that the attacker is female is likely to be greater than 0.85.

Unfortunately, without more precise information, we cannot provide a strict numerical estimate for the probability of the attacker being male.

{probability: less than 0.85, please note that this is an estimation based on the information provided)
