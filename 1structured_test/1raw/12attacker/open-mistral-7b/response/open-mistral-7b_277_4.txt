Given the provided information, let's reason through this problem:
1. We know that the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender, and a 20% error rate.
2. However, we do not know the exact gender distribution in the group of people the witness observed, only that the city's population is 85% female and 15% male.
3. Since we don't have enough information about the specific context or environment the witness observed, it is not possible to accurately calculate the probability of the attacker being male based solely on the witness's accuracy rate.

Therefore, the strict answer in the requested format is: {probability: Unable to calculate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
