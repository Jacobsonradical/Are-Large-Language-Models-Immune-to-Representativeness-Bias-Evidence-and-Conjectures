To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population ratio and the witness's accuracy.

1. The population ratio of males is 15% (0.15).
2. The witness's accuracy in determining gender is 80% (0.8).

Given these two pieces of information, we can't directly use the population ratio because the witness's judgment may not perfectly reflect the actual population. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness's judgment.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15), and P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male (0.8).

We don't have enough information to calculate the probability P(B) directly, but we can use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, so P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * P(not A) = 0.12 (since P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12
= 0.625

So, given the witness's judgment, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.625 or 62.5%.
