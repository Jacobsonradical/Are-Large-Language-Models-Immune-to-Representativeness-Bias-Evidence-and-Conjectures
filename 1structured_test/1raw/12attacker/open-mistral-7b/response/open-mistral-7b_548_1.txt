To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual distribution of genders in the city.

Let's denote the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as M, and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as 1-M (since the sum of probabilities should be 1).

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, and the witness's accuracy is 80%, we can represent this information as follows:

M * 0.15 + (1-M) * 0.85 = 0.8

Solving this equation for M, we get:

M = 0.66667

Since the witness's identification is not 100% accurate, we should adjust the probability of the attacker being male based on this inaccuracy. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, there is a 20% chance that the attacker is actually female.

Therefore, the adjusted probability of the attacker being male is:

0.66667 * 0.8 + 0 * 0.2 = 0.53334

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 53.33%.
