To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have information about the specific gender of the attacker, we can assume that the witness's error could have been made in either direction (mistaking a female for a male or vice versa).

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake in favor of a male attacker:

Probability of witness erring and stating a male attacker = Probability of witness erring * Probability of population being male
                                                               = 0.20 * 0.15
                                                               = 0.03

Since the witness's statement of a male attacker could be a result of their error, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that the attacker is indeed male:

Probability of attacker being male = 1 - Probability of witness erring and stating a male attacker
                                           = 1 - 0.03
                                           = 0.97

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.97 or 97%.
