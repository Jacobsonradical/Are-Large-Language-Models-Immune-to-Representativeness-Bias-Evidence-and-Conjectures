To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being male as P(male). According to the witness's reliability, when they encounter a person at random, they incorrectly identify the gender as male with a probability of 0.2. So, the probability they correctly identify a male is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of the witness encountering a male person at random is 0.15. Therefore, the probability they correctly identify a male person in the general population is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

However, the witness identified the attacker as male, which means they were correct. So, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is equal to the probability of the witness being correct. This probability can be calculated as the ratio of the number of times the witness correctly identifies a male to the total number of times they encounter a male.

Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and they encounter a male 15% of the time, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12. {probability: 0.12}
