To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence E

In this case, the hypothesis H is that the attacker is male, and the evidence E is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

From the provided information, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time when the person was male)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the population of males in the city is 15%)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12

We don't have enough information to calculate P(E|not H), which represents the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as male when the person was female. However, we can rewrite Bayes' theorem as:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) / P(E)

Now, we just need to calculate the numerator and the denominator.

P(E|H) = 0.8
P(E) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.6666666666666667, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 66.67%.
