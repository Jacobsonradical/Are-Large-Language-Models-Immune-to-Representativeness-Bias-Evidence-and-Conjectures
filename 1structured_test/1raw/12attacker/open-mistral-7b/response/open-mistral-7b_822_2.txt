Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes known.

In this case, we have two hypotheses: the attacker is male (H1) and the attacker is female (H2). We have two pieces of evidence: the witness's testimony (E) and the gender distribution in the city (D).

Let's denote:
P(H1) as the prior probability of the attacker being male,
P(H2) as the prior probability of the attacker being female,
P(E|H1) as the probability of the witness identifying a male as male,
P(E|H2) as the probability of the witness identifying a female as male (which is the error probability),
P(D) as the probability of the gender distribution in the city,
P(D|H1) as the probability of this gender distribution given that the attacker is male,
P(D|H2) as the probability of this gender distribution given that the attacker is female.

From the problem statement, we have:
P(E|H1) = 0.8
P(E|H2) = 0.2
P(D) = 0.85 (the probability that a randomly chosen person is female in the city)
P(D|H1) = P(D|H2) = 1 (since the gender distribution is the same for both hypotheses)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) * P(H1) / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H2) * P(H2)]

Since we don't have the prior probabilities P(H1) and P(H2), we can't compute the exact probability. However, we can make an educated guess based on the gender distribution in the city. Given that 85% of the population is female, it's reasonable to assume that the prior probability of the attacker being male (P(H1)) is lower than 0.15. So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.1, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This is a rough estimate and the actual probability might be slightly different, but based on the given information, we can say that the probability that the attacker is male is around 10%.
