Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

The prior probability of the attacker being male (P(H)) is unknown, but we can calculate it from the population statistics provided (b):

P(H) = 15% = 0.15

The likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male (given that the attacker is actually male) is 80% (from a). This is denoted as P(E|H) = 0.8.

The likelihood of the witness identifying a female as male (given that the attacker is actually female) is 20% (from a). This is denoted as P(E|~H) = 0.2.

The probability of the witness making a mistake (given that the attacker is female) is the complementary probability: P(~E|H) = 1 - P(E|H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male (P(H|E)):

P(H|E) = [P(H) * P(E|H)] / [P(H) * P(E|H) + P(~H) * P(E|~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = [0.15 * 0.8] / [0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2]

Calculating:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.21 = 0.5714

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.57 or 57%.
