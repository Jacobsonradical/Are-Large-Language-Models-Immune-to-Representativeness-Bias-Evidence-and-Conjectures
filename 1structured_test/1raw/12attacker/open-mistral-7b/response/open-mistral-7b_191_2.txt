This is a probability problem that involves Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event A as "the attacker is male" and B as "the witness identifies the attacker as male."

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A), which is the probability that the attacker is male in the population. Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood ratio P(B|A) / P(B|not A), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker divided by the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2. Therefore, P(B|A) / P(B|not A) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

After simplifying and calculating, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement is approximately 0.53.

Therefore, {probability: 0.53}
