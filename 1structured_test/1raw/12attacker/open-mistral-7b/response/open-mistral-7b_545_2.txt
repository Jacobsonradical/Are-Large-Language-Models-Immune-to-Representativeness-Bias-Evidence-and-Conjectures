To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80% (correctly identifying male or female), and they err 20% of the time. However, we only know the error rate for misidentifying the gender. To find the accuracy for identifying male, we can subtract the error rate from 1:

Accuracy for identifying male = 1 - Error rate for identifying male
                                            = 1 - 0.20
                                            = 0.80

Given that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male, we can represent this as a 2x1 probability distribution:

| Female   | Male    |
|----------|---------|
| 0.85     | 0.15    |

If we assume that the witness's gender identification is independent of the actual gender of the person they are observing, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male as:

Probability of witness identifying male = Probability of encountering a male * Accuracy for identifying male
                                                   = 0.15 * 0.80
                                                   = 0.12

Since the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male, the actual probability that the attacker is male is the complement of this probability:

Estimated probability that the attacker is male = 1 - Probability of witness identifying male
                                                                 = 1 - 0.12
                                                                 = 0.88

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.88 or 88%.
