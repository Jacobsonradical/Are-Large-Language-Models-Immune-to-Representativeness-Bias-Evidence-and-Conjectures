Given the information provided, the population has an 85% chance of being female and a 15% chance of being male. However, a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender erred and identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually male, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake in identifying a female attacker, and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is male.

1. The probability of the witness making a mistake in identifying a female attacker is the probability of a female attacker times the probability of the witness erring, which is 0.85 (probability of female) * 0.2 (probability of error) = 0.1735
2. The probability that the witness is correct when the attacker is male is therefore 1 - 0.1735 = 0.8265

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.8265}
