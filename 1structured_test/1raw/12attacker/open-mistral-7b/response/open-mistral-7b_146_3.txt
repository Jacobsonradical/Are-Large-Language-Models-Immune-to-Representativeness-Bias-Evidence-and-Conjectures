Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data: 1) The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and 2) The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

However, the witness's ability to identify gender doesn't directly give us the probability that the attacker is male in this specific case. We need to consider the gender distribution in the city to make an estimate.

Let's assume that the attacker is a person randomly selected from the city's population. Since 85% of the population is female, the attacker is more likely to be female.

But the witness identified the attacker as male with a 80% confidence. To account for this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event A (in this case, the attacker being male) given evidence B (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, given that the attacker is male)
- P(A) is the probability of A (the probability that the attacker is male, without considering the witness's identification)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, without considering whether the attacker is male or female)

We have the values for P(B|A) and P(B) from the given information (80% and 100%, respectively, since the witness is always correct when identifying males). The value for P(A) can be calculated using the given gender distribution in the city (15%).

However, without the ability to directly calculate P(A|B), I cannot provide a strict numerical estimate. But based on the information and the application of Bayes' theorem, it can be inferred that the attacker is more likely to be male than female, despite the 85% female majority in the city.
