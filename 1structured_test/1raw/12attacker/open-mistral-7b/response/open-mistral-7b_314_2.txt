To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an assumption about the attacker's gender being independent of the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and the city's population is 85% female and 15% male. Let's assume that the attacker is randomly chosen from the city's population.

1. If the attacker is female, the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.
2. If the attacker is male, the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male is the witness's correct rate, which is 80%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker, which is the witness's correct rate.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (or 80%).
