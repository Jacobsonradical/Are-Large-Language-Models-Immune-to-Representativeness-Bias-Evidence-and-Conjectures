Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness identifies the gender correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The probability of randomly selecting a male from the population is 15% (since 85% of the population is female and 15% is male).

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Attack) = [P(Attack | Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Attack | Male) * P(Male) + P(Attack | Female) * P(Female)]

However, we only have information about P(Male) and the witness's ability to identify gender, but not P(Attack | Male) or P(Attack | Female).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that P(Attack | Male) is 1 (the attacker is indeed male in this case). But without more specific information, we cannot calculate P(Attack | Female).

So, we cannot provide a strict numerical estimate based on the given information. However, we can say that since the witness identified the attacker as male, there's at least a 1 in 5 chance that the attacker is male (given the population distribution). This is because the witness, who is generally accurate, identified the attacker as male, which means the attacker has a higher chance of being male than the general population.
