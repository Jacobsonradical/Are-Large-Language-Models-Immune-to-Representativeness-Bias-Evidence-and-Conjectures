To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. According to the information provided, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification:

The witness said the attacker is male, so there are two possible scenarios:
a) The attacker is actually male.
b) The witness made an error and misidentified a female as male.

The probability of scenario a is the actual probability of the attacker being male (P(male)).
The probability of scenario b is the probability of the witness erring and misidentifying a female as male (P(female) * 0.20, where 0.20 is the error rate).

Since these are mutually exclusive events, their probabilities add up to the total probability of the witness saying "male":

P(male | witnessed as male) = P(male) + P(female) * 0.20

Now we only need to find the value of P(male). To do this, we can set up an equation using the city's gender distribution:

P(male) = P(male | witnessed as male) - P(female) * 0.20

Plugging in the values we know,

P(male) = 0.25 - 0.85 * 0.20

P(male) = 0.25 - 0.17

P(male) = 0.08

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.08 or 8%.
