To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the population.

Let's assume that the attacker's gender is either male (M) or female (F). The witness's error rate (20%) means that for every 100 people they identify, they will incorrectly identify 20 as the opposite gender.

Given that 85% of the population is female, there are approximately 85 females for every 100 people. This means that there are 15 males for every 100 people.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, which means they correctly identify 80 male individuals for every 100 people. Since they are incorrect 20% of the time, they incorrectly identify 20 male individuals as female.

However, since there are only 15 male individuals in every 100 people, the 20 incorrect identifications are actually 20 female individuals being mistakenly identified as male. This means that the witness correctly identifies 80 - 20 = 60 male individuals out of 100 people.

Now, let's consider the case where the witness identifies someone as male. Since the witness correctly identifies 60 out of 100 male individuals, the probability that the attacker is actually male given that the witness identified them as male is 60/100 = 0.6 or 60%.

In other words, based on the witness's ability and the city's gender distribution, there is a 60% chance that the attacker is male.

{probability: 0.6}
