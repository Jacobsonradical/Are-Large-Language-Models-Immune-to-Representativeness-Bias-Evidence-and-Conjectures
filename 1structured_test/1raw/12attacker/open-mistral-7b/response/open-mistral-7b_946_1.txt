Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, we also have a witness who, under similar conditions, correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male.

Now, we need to account for both the actual population distribution and the witness's unreliability. Since the witness is not perfect, we cannot simply take their word for it and assume the attacker is male with a 100% certainty.

Instead, let's consider two possibilities:

1. The attacker is actually male (as the witness claims). In this case, the probability is just the proportion of male individuals in the city.
2. The attacker is female, but the witness mistakenly identified them as male. In this case, the probability is the proportion of female individuals in the city multiplied by the probability of the witness making a mistake.

The probabilities for these two scenarios can be calculated as follows:

1. Probability if the attacker is actually male: 15% (proportion of male individuals)
2. Probability if the witness makes a mistake: 0.2 (error rate)
3. Probability if the attacker is female and the witness mistakes her gender: 0.85 (proportion of female individuals) * 0.2 (error rate)

Now, we can calculate the total probability by adding these two possibilities:

Probability of the attacker being male = 15% + 0.85 * 0.2 = 15% + 0.17 = 16.05%

So, our estimate, based on the given information, is that there is a 16.05% probability that the attacker is male. This estimate takes into account both the actual population distribution and the witness's unreliability.
