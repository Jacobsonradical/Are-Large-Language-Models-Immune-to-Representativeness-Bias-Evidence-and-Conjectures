Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being male, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as male. The prior probability of event A (the attacker being male) is unknown, so we can use the information about the gender distribution in the city to estimate it.

From information b, we know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. Therefore, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15%).

The probability of the witness identifying a male attacker as male is given in information a as 0.8. So, the probability of event B given event A is 0.8.

The probability of the witness identifying a female attacker as male is given in information a as 0.2. So, the probability of event B given the complement of event A (the attacker being female) is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability of the complement of event A given event B is 0.2/0.8 = 0.25.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of event A given event B as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

This simplifies to:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
               = 0.12 / 0.29
               = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.4138 or 41.38%.
