To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male,
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female,
- p as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, and
- q as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male (1 - p).

The witness's statement tells us that p = 0.8 and q = 0.2. The gender distribution in the city is given as 85% female and 15% male, which means P(F) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15.

When the witness identifies a person as male, there are two possibilities:
1) The person is actually male (P(M) * p)
2) The person is actually female, but the witness mistakenly identifies her as male (P(F) * q)

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is:
P(M | witness's statement) = (P(M) * p) + (P(F) * q)

Substituting the given values:
P(M | witness's statement) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is 0.29 or 29%.
