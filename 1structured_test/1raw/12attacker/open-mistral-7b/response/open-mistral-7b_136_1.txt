To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's assume that the attacker's gender is either male (M) or female (F). The witness's error rate is 20%, so when they identify someone as male, there's a 20% chance they're actually mistaken and the person is female.

Given that 85% of the population is female (F), the probability of a random person being female is 0.85. The probability of a random person being male is then 0.15.

When the witness identifies someone as male, the probability that the actual gender is male is the probability of the witness being correct plus the probability of the witness being incorrect but still identifying the correct gender.

So, the probability P(M|W="Male") is:
P(M|W="Male") = P(M|true positive) + P(F|false positive) * P(M)
                 = P(correct gender identification) + P(error) * P(M)
                 = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
                 = 0.12 + 0.17
                 = 0.29

Therefore, the estimate for the probability that the attacker is male is 0.29. This means that the attacker is estimated to be male with a probability of approximately 29%.
