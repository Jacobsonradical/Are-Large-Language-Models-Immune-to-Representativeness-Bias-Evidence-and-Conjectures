To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an assumption about the attacker's gender being independent of the witness's ability to identify gender.

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.

Given the independence assumption, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male as male by multiplying the probability of the attacker being male by the witness's accuracy in identifying males:

P(attacker is male) * P(witness correctly identifies male) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 12%.

{probability: 0.12}
