To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. According to the given information, 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This means the probability of a randomly chosen person being male is 0.15.

2. However, we also have information about the witness's ability to accurately identify gender. In a sample of equally distributed females and males, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

3. Since the witness misidentified the attacker as male, they must have erred in their gender identification 20% of the time in this situation.

4. Given that the witness's error rate is the same for females and males, and given that the attacker's gender is unknown, it is reasonable to assume that the witness made an error in this case with the same probability as they do overall.

5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's error, is the error rate: 0.20.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, considering both the population distribution and the witness's reliability, is {probability: 0.20}.
