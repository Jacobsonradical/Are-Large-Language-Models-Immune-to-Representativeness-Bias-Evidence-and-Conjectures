To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the population.

In this case, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's gender, the attacker is more likely to be female given the city's gender distribution (85% female and 15% male).

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M) and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F). We know that P(M) + P(F) = 1, and we want to find P(M).

Given that the witness made an error, the actual gender of the attacker should be more likely to be the opposite of the gender the witness identified. Therefore, if the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that the attacker is more likely to be female. Conversely, if the witness identified the attacker as female, the attacker is more likely to be male.

Let E(M) be the event that the witness errs when identifying a male attacker, and let E(F) be the event that the witness errs when identifying a female attacker. We know that P(E(M)) = 0.2 and P(E(F)) = 0.2.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male (given the error) is P(M|E(M)) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.087, and the probability that the attacker is actually female (given the error) is P(F|E(M)) = 0.85 / (0.15 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.913.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we are interested in P(M|E(M)). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.087.
