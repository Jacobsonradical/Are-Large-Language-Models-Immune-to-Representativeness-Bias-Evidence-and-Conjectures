Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given the following:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a male 20% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male, given that 85% of the population is female)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker being female)

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.1725 = 0.2925

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2925 â‰ˆ 0.273

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.273 or 27.3%.
