Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the reliability of the witness and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. Gender distribution in the city: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the prior probability of an event to the likelihood of observing some evidence given that event. In this case, the event is the attacker being male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female. Let P(M|E) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, and P(F|E) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(M|E) = [P(E|M) * P(M)] / [P(E|M) * P(M) + P(E|F) * P(F)]

Given the information, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

1. P(M) = 0.15 (15% male population)
2. P(F) = 0.85 (85% female population)
3. P(M|E) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
4. P(F|E) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies male 20% of the time)

So, P(M|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%. Note that this estimate is based on the witness's reliability and the gender distribution in the city. It might be different in real-world scenarios due to various factors.
