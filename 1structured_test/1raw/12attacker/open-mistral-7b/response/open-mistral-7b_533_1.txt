To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make some assumptions.

1. The witness's accuracy in determining gender is 80%.
2. The population is 85% female and 15% male.

Assuming that the witness's ability to determine gender is independent of the actual gender of the person, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability:

P(Male | Witness's observation) = P(Witness's observation | Male) * P(Male) / [P(Witness's observation | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness's observation | Female) * P(Female)]

The probability of the witness making a correct observation (i.e., identifying the attacker as male) when the attacker is male is 80%. The probability of the witness making a correct observation when the attacker is female is 20%, as the witness errs 20% of the time.

So, P(Witness's observation | Male) = 0.8 and P(Witness's observation | Female) = 0.2

The probability of the attacker being male is P(Male) = 0.15 (as per the second piece of information).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Male | Witness's observation) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(Male | Witness's observation) â‰ˆ 0.196

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's observation, is approximately 19.6%.
