Given the information provided, we have two sources of probability estimates: the population demographics and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

1. Population demographics: We know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. This information alone suggests that the attacker is more likely to be female, given the majority of the population is female. However, we cannot use this information alone to make a definitive probability estimate, as we do not know if the attacker is one of the people in the city.

2. Witness's ability to identify gender: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we do not know if the witness's error rate is the same for identifying males and females. If the error rate is higher for identifying males, then the witness's identification of the attacker as male might be less reliable.

Given the limitations of the information, it is not possible to provide a strict probability estimate based on the given data. However, if we assume that the witness's error rate is the same for males and females, and that the attacker is equally likely to be any individual in the city, then we could approximate the probability as follows:

Assuming the attacker is randomly selected from the population, the probability of the attacker being male is 15%. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as male increases this probability. If we assume that the witness's error rate is the same for males and females, then the witness's identification increases the probability by a factor of 1.8 (since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time).

Therefore, if we assume that the witness's error rate is the same for males and females, and that the attacker is randomly selected from the population, then the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 15% * 1.8 = 27%.

However, as mentioned earlier, this is an approximation and the actual probability could be different due to the limitations of the information provided.
