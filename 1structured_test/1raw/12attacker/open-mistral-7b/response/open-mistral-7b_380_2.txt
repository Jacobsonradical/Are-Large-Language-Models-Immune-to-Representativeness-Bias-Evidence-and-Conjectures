To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's gender identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

From the information given, we know the following probabilities:
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to estimate
- P(E|H): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male
- P(E|~H): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker being female

The first two probabilities are given in the text:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time when the person is male)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time when the person is female)

The third probability can be computed from the given information about the population and the witness's accuracy:
- P(~H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male is 15%)
- P(H) = 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker being female is 85%)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability of H given E:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.85) / [(0.8) * (0.85) + (0.2) * (0.15)]

To calculate the probability, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.6565

The probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.6565 or 65.65%.
