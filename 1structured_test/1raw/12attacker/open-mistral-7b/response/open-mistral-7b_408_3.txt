To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness's accuracy.

1. The general population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness is incorrect 20% of the time.
3. However, the witness correctly identified the attacker as male.

The question does not provide enough information to determine if the witness's correct identification was due to chance or their ability to accurately identify genders. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive estimate based on the given information.

To provide a numerical estimate, we would need more context or additional information, such as the number of times the witness has made such gender identifications in the past, the specific circumstances under which they made the identification, or any other relevant factors.

So, without further information, I cannot provide a probability estimate between 0 and 1.
