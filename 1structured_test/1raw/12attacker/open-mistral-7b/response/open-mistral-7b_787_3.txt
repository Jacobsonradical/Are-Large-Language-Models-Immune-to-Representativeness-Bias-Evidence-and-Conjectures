To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. From the population distribution, we know that 15% of the city's population is male.
2. However, the witness's identification was not always accurate. They correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness said the attacker was male, there are two possible scenarios:
   a) The witness was correct and the attacker is indeed male.
   b) The witness was incorrect, but they mistakenly identified the female attacker as male.

4. Since the witness was correct 80% of the time, the probability of scenario (a) is 0.8 (80%).
5. The probability of scenario (b) is the probability of the witness making a mistake, multiplied by the probability of the attacker being female. Since the attacker is female 15% of the time, the probability of scenario (b) is 0.2 (20%) * 0.15 (15%).
6. To find the total probability of the attacker being male, we need to add the probabilities of both scenarios: 0.8 (correct identification) + 0.2 * 0.15 (incorrect identification) = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.83.
