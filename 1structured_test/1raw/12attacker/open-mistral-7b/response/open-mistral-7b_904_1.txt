To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

From the provided information, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's denote the actual gender of the attacker as A (either male or female), and the witness's gender identification as W (either male or female).

Since the witness could not see the attacker's face, we can assume that the gender distribution in the population they are used to judging is also 50% male and 50% female.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender (P(W=A)) is 0.8 (from the provided information). The probability of the witness erring in identifying the attacker's gender (P(W ≠ A)) is 0.2.

Given that 85% of the city's population is female, the probability of the attacker being female (P(A=female)) is 0.85. The probability of the attacker being male (P(A=male)) is 1 - P(A=female) = 0.15.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities of the witness correctly and incorrectly identifying the attacker's gender, given that the attacker is male.

P(W=male | A=male) = P(W=male ∩ A=male) / P(A=male)
                       = P(W=male) * P(A=male | W=male) + P(W ≠ male) * P(A=male | W ≠ male)
                       = 0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * 0
                       = 0.8

Similarly, P(W ≠ male | A=male) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender as male (P(W=male)) by considering both cases:

P(W=male) = P(W=male | A=male) * P(A=male) + P(W=male | A=female) * P(A=female)
                 = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85
                 = 0.12

Since the witness identifies the attacker as male, P(W=male) is the probability we are interested in. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.12}
