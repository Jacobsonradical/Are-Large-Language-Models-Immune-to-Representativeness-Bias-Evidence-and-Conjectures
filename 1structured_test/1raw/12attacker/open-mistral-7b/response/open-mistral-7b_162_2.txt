Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here,
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification of the attacker as male)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (85% for male, 15% for female)
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's ability to correctly identify male attackers is 80%)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (given that the population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of a male witness identifying a male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12)

Now, let's calculate:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
            = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.12]
            â‰ˆ 0.75

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.75 or 75%.
