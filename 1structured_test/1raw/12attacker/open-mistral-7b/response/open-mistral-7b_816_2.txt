Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1) The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2) The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

The witness's statement indicates that they are not always correct in their gender identification. In this case, they are right 80% of the time, which means they are wrong 20% of the time.

However, we don't have any direct information about how this error rate applies to the specific situation of the attack. We don't know if the witness's error rate is higher or lower when they are uncertain or when they are making assumptions based on limited information, like in this case where they couldn't see the attacker's gender.

Therefore, without more specific information, it's not possible to accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is male. The witness's statement about their ability to identify gender is useful in understanding their general accuracy, but it doesn't necessarily apply to this specific situation. So, I would have to conclude that I cannot provide a number between 0 and 1 as the probability estimate.
