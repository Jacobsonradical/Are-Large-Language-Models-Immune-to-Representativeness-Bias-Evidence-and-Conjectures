To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80% (correct) and 20% (incorrect).
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

The witness's statement suggests that they make errors in identifying gender 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the error was in identifying a male as female or a female as male, we'll assume an equal error rate of 10% for each gender. This means that the witness correctly identifies males 90% of the time and females 80% of the time.

Now, let's consider the possibility that the witness is mistaken. If the witness claimed the attacker was male, this means they might have mistakenly identified a female as a male. Since the population is 85% female, the probability of this mistake happening is 0.1 * 0.85 = 0.084, or 8.4%.

However, the witness's statement also indicates that there is a 20% chance of an error. Since we've accounted for the 8.4% chance of mistakenly identifying a female as a male, the remaining 11.6% (20% - 8.4%) must be due to the witness mistakenly identifying a male as a female.

But since the city is only 15% male, the probability of this mistake happening is much lower than the 11.6% we calculated above. In fact, it's only 0.1 * 0.15 = 0.015, or 1.5%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, it's more likely that they were correct than that they made an extremely rare mistake. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.9, or 90%.
