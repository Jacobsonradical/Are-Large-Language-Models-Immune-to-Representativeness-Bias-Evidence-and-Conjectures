To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event we're interested in is the attacker being male (H1), and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male (E). We also have background information about the gender distribution in the city (P(H1) = probability of the attacker being male, and P(H0) = probability of the attacker being female).

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H0) * P(H0)]

From the given information, we have:

1. P(E|H1) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time)
2. P(E|H0) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male 20% of the time)
3. P(H1) = Unknown (we want to find this value)
4. P(H0) = 1 - P(H1) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is female)

Now we can solve for P(H1|E):

P(H1|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(H1|E) â‰ˆ 0.143

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city, is approximately 14.3%.
