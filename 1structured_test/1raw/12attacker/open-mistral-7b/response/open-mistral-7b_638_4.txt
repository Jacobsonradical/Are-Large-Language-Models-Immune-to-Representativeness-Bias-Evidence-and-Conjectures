Given the two pieces of information, we can break this down into two probabilities: the probability of the attacker being male based on the city's population (A), and the probability of the attacker being misidentified as male by the witness (B).

The probability A is 15%, as stated in the question.

The probability B, given that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, or 80%. However, the witness identified the attacker as male, so we are interested in the probability of this event occurring given that the attacker is actually male (P(M|W)) or given that the attacker is female (P(F|W)).

Given that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, if the attacker is actually female, there is a 20% chance that the witness will identify the attacker as male (P(W|F)). Therefore, P(M|W) = P(M) / (P(M) + P(W|F)) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 / 0.26 = 0.5769.

However, the witness's identification has already been established to be male. Therefore, we are only interested in the probability of this event occurring given that the attacker is actually male, which is 1.

Since the witness's identification matches the gender of the attacker, the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's identification is 1. This is a strong contradiction to the probability established based on the city's population. This situation suggests that the witness's identification might be unreliable, especially given that the attack occurred at night and the witness might not have had a clear view of the attacker.

To provide a probability estimate, we would need to make an assumption about the reliability of the witness's identification in this specific situation. Without this information, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate. Therefore, {probability: Unable to provide a number between 0 and 1, please reconsider the information given.}
