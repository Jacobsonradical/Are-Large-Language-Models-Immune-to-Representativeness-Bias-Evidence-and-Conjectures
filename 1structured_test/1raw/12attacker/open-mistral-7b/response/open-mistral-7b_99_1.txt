To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification of a male attacker.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In our case, the prior probability of the attacker being male is unknown, so we'll make an assumption based on the information given in "b": 15% of the population is male.

The likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker given that the attacker is male is given in "a" as 0.8.

The probability of the witness identifying a male attacker given that the attacker is female is also given in "a" as 0.2. Since the population is 50% female, this is equivalent to the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is female, or 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

The probability of the witness identifying a male attacker, regardless of the attacker's gender, is the sum of these two probabilities, or 0.8 + 0.1 = 0.9.

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.9)

This calculation gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, of about 0.12.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is: {probability: 0.12}
