Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We have a witness who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we don't know if the witness's errors are more likely to be misidentifying males as females or females as males.
3. We also know that the city population is 85% female and 15% male.

Without more information about the witness's error distribution, it's not possible to accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is male. The witness's error rate could skew towards misidentifying males as females, which would reduce the actual probability of the attacker being male, or it could skew the other way, increasing the probability.

Therefore, I cannot provide a numerical probability estimate within the given constraints.
