To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Given these facts, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male is the proportion of male individuals in the city multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, plus the probability of the witness erring and identifying a female as male, multiplied by the proportion of female individuals in the city.

Let P(male) be the probability that the attacker is male. Then, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(male) = Probability of correct identification * Proportion of males + Probability of incorrect identification * Proportion of females

P(male) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

P(male) = 0.12 + 0.1765

P(male) â‰ˆ 0.2965

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.2965 or 29.65%.
