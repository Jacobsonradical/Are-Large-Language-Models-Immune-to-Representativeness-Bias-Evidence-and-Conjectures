To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. We know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. This means the prior probability of an attacker being male is 0.15 (15% as a decimal).

2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. The likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker as male is 0.8, and the likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker as female is 0.2.

3. Since the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male, we only consider the probability of the correct identification being 0.2 (the probability of the witness's error). This means that the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is 0.2 (the probability of the witness's error).

4. However, this probability does not take into account the prior probability of the attacker being male. To account for this, we need to multiply the prior probability by the likelihood given the evidence.

5. Therefore, the posterior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (3%).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.03}.
