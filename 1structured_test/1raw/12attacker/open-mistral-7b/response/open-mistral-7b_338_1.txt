To estimate the probability of the attacker being male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city has an 85% female population and a 15% male population.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

a) The attacker is actually male. In this case, the witness correctly identified the gender.
b) The attacker is actually female. In this case, the witness made an error.

Let's calculate the probabilities for each scenario:

a) Probability of the attacker being male and the witness correctly identifying gender: 0.15 (probability of the attacker being male) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12

b) Probability of the attacker being female and the witness mistakenly identifying gender: 0.85 (probability of the attacker being female) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17

The total probability of the witness identifying a male attacker, given that the attacker is either male or female, is the sum of the above probabilities:

Total probability = 0.12 (probability of scenario a) + 0.17 (probability of scenario b) = 0.29

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%.
