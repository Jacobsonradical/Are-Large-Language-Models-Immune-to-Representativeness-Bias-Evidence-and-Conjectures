Given the information provided, there are two main factors to consider: the gender distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender.

The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male. However, we also have information about the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we should consider both the possibility that the witness was correct and the possibility that the witness was wrong.

If the witness was correct, then the attacker is indeed male. In this case, the probability is simply the proportion of males in the city, which is 15%.

If the witness was wrong, then the attacker is actually female, despite the witness's identification. In this case, the probability is the proportion of females in the city, which is 85%.

However, we know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time. So, out of the 20% of the time when the witness errs, the error will be misidentifying a female as male. The actual proportion of females misidentified as males by the witness is therefore 20% * 0.85 (the probability of picking a female at random from the city population).

So, the probability of the witness being wrong and misidentifying a female as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is the sum of the two probabilities: 15% (if the witness was correct) + 17% (if the witness was wrong but misidentified a female as male).

Therefore, {probability: 0.32, the attacker is likely to be male with a probability of 32%}
