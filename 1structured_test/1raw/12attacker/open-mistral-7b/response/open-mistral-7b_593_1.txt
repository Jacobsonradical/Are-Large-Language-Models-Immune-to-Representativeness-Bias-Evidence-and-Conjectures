To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, the event is that the attacker is male, and we have prior knowledge about the gender distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is male,
- E as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the information given, we know:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to find.
- P(E|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, given that the attacker is male. This is given as 0.8 in the data.
- P(E|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, given that the attacker is not male. This can be calculated as 1 - P(E|A) * P(not A / A) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.
- P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.5 (given that the population is equally divided between males and females).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|E) = 0.8 * 0.5 / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.03 * (1 - 0.5)]

Calculating this, we find:

P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.48

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
