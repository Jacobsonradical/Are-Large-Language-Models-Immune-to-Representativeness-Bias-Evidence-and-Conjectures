Given the information provided, the attacker's gender was initially unknown to the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as male. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80% and their error rate is 20%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can consider this as a success for the witness (correct identification). The probability of this success happening if the attacker was actually female is the error rate of the witness, which is 20%.

On the other hand, if the attacker was actually male, the probability of the witness identifying him correctly is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 80%.

So, we have two probabilities: the probability of the witness identifying a female as male (error rate) and the probability of the witness identifying a male as male (accuracy rate).

The probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as the probability of the witness's identification being correct (given that the attacker is male), which is the witness's accuracy rate:

{probability: 0.8}
