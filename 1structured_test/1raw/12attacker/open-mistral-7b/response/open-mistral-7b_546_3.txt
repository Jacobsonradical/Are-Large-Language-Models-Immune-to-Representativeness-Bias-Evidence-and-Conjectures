Given the information provided, we have two sources of data to consider: the city's population demographics and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The city's population demographics suggest that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. This means that if the attacker is randomly chosen from the city population, the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15/100 or 1/6).

2. However, we also have information about the witness's ability to correctly identify gender. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there's a 0.8 probability that their identification was correct and a 0.2 probability that it was an error.

Unfortunately, we cannot directly combine these probabilities to get a single estimate because the two events are not independent. The witness's identification is not a random event but depends on their ability to correctly judge gender.

To get a more accurate estimate, we would need more information, such as the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the actual gender is male or female, or the likelihood of the assault occurring in an area with a different gender distribution.

As it stands, the best estimate we can provide is based solely on the city's population demographics, which is 0.15 (15%). However, this estimate may not accurately reflect the actual probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.
