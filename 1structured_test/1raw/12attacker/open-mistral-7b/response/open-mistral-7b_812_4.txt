To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is that the witness identified the attacker as male.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the hypothesis A given the evidence B.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the evidence B given the hypothesis A.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the hypothesis A.
- P(B) is the probability of the evidence B.

From the information provided, we have:

- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time when the person was male)
- P(A) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is female, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15)
- P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16 (the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, regardless of the actual gender)

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.16 = 0.125

So, our estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.125 or 12.5%.
