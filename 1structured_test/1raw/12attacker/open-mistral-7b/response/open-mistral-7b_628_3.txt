To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the witness's error was misidentifying a male as female or vice versa, let's assume that the error rate is evenly distributed between the two genders. This means that the witness misidentifies males as females 10% of the time and females as males 10% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of a randomly selected person being male is 0.15.

The witness identified the attacker as male. If the witness made an error, the actual gender of the attacker would be the opposite of the identified gender. In this case, the error rate is 0.10 for each gender, so the probability of the witness making an error and the actual gender being male is 0.10 * 0.85 = 0.0845.

Since the witness did not make an error, the actual gender of the attacker must be the same as the identified gender. So, the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is 0.15 (probability of a randomly selected person being male) * 0.9 (probability of the witness not making an error) = 0.135.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.135}.
