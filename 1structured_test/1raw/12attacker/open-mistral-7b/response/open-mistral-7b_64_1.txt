Given the information provided, there are two sources of probability to consider: the population gender distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population gender distribution (as per information "a"): 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy in gender identification (as per information "b"): 80% correct and 20% error.

Since the witness's statement about the attacker's gender contradicts the statistical gender distribution in the city, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy.

The witness's statement suggests that the attacker is male. Given the witness's 80% accuracy in gender identification, it would imply that, out of 100 times the witness identifies a person as male, 80 of those times are actually correct.

However, we know that the actual gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male. This means that, even if the witness is 100% accurate, there is still a higher probability of encountering a female person in the city than a male one.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy. One approach to do this is to calculate the probability of the witness making a false positive (identifying a female as male) and then subtracting that from 1.

The probability of a false positive (according to information "b"):
1 - (Probability of correct identification) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

The probability that the witness's statement about the attacker being male is correct, given the population distribution and the witness's accuracy, can be estimated as the probability of a false positive occurring (since the witness's statement is a false positive if the attacker is female):

{probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This estimate suggests a low probability of the attacker being male, given the population distribution and the witness's accuracy. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified analysis and other factors, such as the witness's confidence or potential biases, might influence the actual probability.
