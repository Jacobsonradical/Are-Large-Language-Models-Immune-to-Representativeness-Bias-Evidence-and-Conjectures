Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The attacker's gender is unknown to the victim.
2. According to the statistics, 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.
3. A witness identified the attacker as male, but their accuracy in gender identification is only 80% under similar conditions.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's error rate. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that they were correct in 80% of their cases or incorrect in 20% of their cases.

However, we don't know if the witness's error was in this case or if they correctly identified the attacker as male. To account for this uncertainty, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability based on new information.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is proportional to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the prior probability of A. In this case, A is the attacker being male, and B is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

The prior probability of A (attacker being male) is 15%, and the probability of B given A (witness correctly identifying the attacker) is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate).

The probability of B given not-A (witness incorrectly identifying the attacker) is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

To simplify the calculation, let's assume that the witness's error rate is the same for both genders. This assumption might not be entirely accurate, but it simplifies the calculation and still provides a reasonable estimate.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the updated probability of A given B as:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A))

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating the result, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.12

So, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12, or 12%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions, and the actual probability might be different.
