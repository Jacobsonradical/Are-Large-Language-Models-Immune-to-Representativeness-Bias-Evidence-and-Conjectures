Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

Let's define our events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

The prior probability of the attacker being male (P(A)) is not given, but we can estimate it using the population statistics in the city (event B):

P(A) = proportion of males in the population
     = 0.15 (from information b)

The probability of the witness identifying a male as male (given that the attacker is male) is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8 (from information a).

P(B|A) = 0.8

The probability of the witness identifying a female as male (given that the attacker is female) is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 (from information a).

P(B|~A) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

First, let's calculate P(~A), which is the prior probability of the attacker being female:

P(~A) = 1 - P(A)
      = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
      â‰ˆ 0.103

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 10.3%.
