To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the population distribution of gender in the city and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. From the given information, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness was able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time and made errors 20% of the time.

However, the witness's errors are not specified as being more likely to occur when identifying males or females. Therefore, we cannot directly factor these errors into our calculation without additional information.

Given this lack of specificity, the best estimate we can make is based on the population distribution alone:

{probability: 0.15}

The attacker is estimated to be male with a probability of 15%, assuming no errors in gender identification by the witness or any bias in the witness's errors.
