Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is male) given the evidence (witness's identification and gender distribution in the city)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identified a male attacker 80% of the time, so this is 0.8)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (85% of population is female, so 15% is male, which is 0.15)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness's ability to correctly identify gender, which is 0.5 since the witness is correct half the time)

Using these probabilities, we can calculate the probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.5)]

Calculating this, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%. This estimate takes into account both the gender distribution in the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.
