To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability.

1. The population statistics indicate that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's reliability, as stated, is that they correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

A) The attacker is indeed male, and the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender.
B) The attacker is female, and the witness erroneously identified the attacker as male.

The probability of scenario A (the attacker is male) is the probability that the attacker is male in the population multiplied by the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender.

The probability of scenario B (the attacker is female) is the probability that the attacker is female in the population multiplied by the probability that the witness erroneously identified the attacker as male.

Given the information, we can calculate these probabilities as follows:

Probability of A = Probability of attacker being male * Probability of witness correctly identifying male = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

Probability of B = Probability of attacker being female * Probability of witness incorrectly identifying female as male = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Since the witness's statement is evidence of scenario A, we should add the probability of this scenario to account for this evidence. This is known as the likelihood ratio, which in this case is the ratio of the probabilities of scenarios A and B:

Likelihood ratio = Probability of A / Probability of B = 0.12 / 0.17 ≈ 0.71

The likelihood ratio is greater than 1, indicating that the witness's statement provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that the attacker is male. However, the question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, not the likelihood ratio.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can take the likelihood ratio and divide it by the sum of the likelihood ratio and 1:

Probability of attacker being male = Likelihood ratio / (Likelihood ratio + 1) = 0.71 / (0.71 + 1) ≈ 0.42

So, based on the population statistics and the witness's reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.42 or 42%.
