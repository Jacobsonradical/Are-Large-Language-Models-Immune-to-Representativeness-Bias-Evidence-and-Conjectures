Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. This means that if we randomly select a person from the city, the probability of selecting a male is 0.15 (15%).

2. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as male. The witness's ability to accurately judge gender is 80%, meaning they incorrectly identify the gender 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

A) The witness correctly identified the attacker as male, in which case the attacker is indeed male.
B) The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, in which case the attacker is female.

We cannot know for sure which scenario is the case, but we can calculate the probabilities of each scenario.

A) Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker: 0.15 (probability of selecting a male from the city)

B) Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male: 0.85 (probability of selecting a female from the city) * 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

Now, we need to find the sum of these probabilities to get the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male:

0.15 (Scenario A) + 0.85 * 0.20 (Scenario B)

Using a calculator, we get:

0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately 0.32 (32%). This is less than the actual male population percentage, which suggests that the witness might have made an error in their identification.
