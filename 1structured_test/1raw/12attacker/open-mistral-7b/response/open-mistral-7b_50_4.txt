To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the gender distribution in the city is the same as the population sampled by the witness (since no information suggests otherwise), then the probability of the attacker being male is equal to the proportion of males in the population multiplied by the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male, plus the probability of the witness erring and identifying a female as male.

Let P(male) be the probability that the attacker is male. Then, we have:

P(male) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(male) = 0.12 + 0.17

P(male) = 0.29

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%.
