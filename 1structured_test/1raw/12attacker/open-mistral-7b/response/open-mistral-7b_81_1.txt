Given the information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The initial probability of the attacker being male, based on the city's gender distribution.
2. The probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker's gender and incorrectly reporting that the attacker is male.

Let's calculate these probabilities:

1. The initial probability of the attacker being male:
   - 15% of the population is male, so the probability of choosing a male attacker at random is 0.15.

2. The probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker's gender:
   - The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
   - Given that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male, the actual attacker could be either male or female with equal probability (since we do not know the attacker's gender). In this case, the witness's mistake is a false positive.
   - The probability of a false positive is the probability of the witness erring multiplied by the probability of the actual attacker being female.
   - Since we know that the witness errs 20% of the time, and 15% of the population is male, the probability of the actual attacker being female is 0.85 (due to the city's gender distribution).
   - Therefore, the probability of a false positive is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can calculate the probability of the witness reporting a male attacker while the actual attacker is female (a false positive): 0.17.

Since we do not have enough information to determine the probability of the witness reporting a male attacker while the actual attacker is male (a true positive), we cannot calculate the overall probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's report.

Based on the information provided, the calculation cannot be strictly answered in the requested dictionary format.
