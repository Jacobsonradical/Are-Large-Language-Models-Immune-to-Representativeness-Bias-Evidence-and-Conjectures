To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

A) The attacker is actually male. In this case, the witness correctly identified the gender.
B) The attacker is female. In this case, the witness made an error.

Let's calculate the probability for each scenario:

A) Probability of the attacker being male (correctly identified) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy)

B) Probability of the attacker being female (wrongly identified) = 0.2 (witness's error rate) * 0.15 (probability of a female being in the city)

Now, we need to find the total probability of both scenarios:

Total probability = Probability of A + Probability of B

Total probability = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.15
Total probability = 0.12 + 0.03
Total probability = 0.15

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 or 15%.
