To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F). We know that P(M) + P(F) = 1 (since the attacker must be either male or female).

The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a male, they correctly identify him as male 80% of the time, and when they see a female, they correctly identify her as female 80% of the time.

Let's denote the probability that the witness mistakes a male for a female as E(M), and the probability that the witness mistakes a female for a male as E(F). We know that E(M) + E(F) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases).

Given that 85% of the population is female, we can say that P(F) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15.

The witness correctly identifies a male 0.8 times, so the probability of the witness seeing a male and correctly identifying him as such is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

However, since the witness mistakes a female for a male 0.2 times, there is a probability of 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 that the witness sees a female and mistakenly identifies her as a male.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the sum of the probabilities of the witness seeing a male and correctly identifying him, and the probabilities of the witness seeing a female and mistakenly identifying her:

P(M) = 0.12 + 0.17 * (P(M) / P(F))

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(M) = 0.12 + 0.17 * (0.15 / 0.85)

P(M) = 0.12 + 0.06

P(M) â‰ˆ 0.18

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.18 or 18%.
