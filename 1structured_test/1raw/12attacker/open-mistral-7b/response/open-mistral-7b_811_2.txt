To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to calculate the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given evidence (the witness's gender identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break down each part:

1. P(H | E) is what we want to find: the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified a male attacker.
2. P(E | H) is the probability that the witness identifies a male attacker given that the attacker is indeed male. This is given as 80% in the provided information.
3. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male. Given the population statistics, this can be estimated as 15% (since 15% of the city's population is male).
4. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker, regardless of the attacker's gender. This is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (80%) and incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male (20%). Since there are twice as many female as male individuals in the city (85% female), the probability of incorrectly identifying a female as male is 2 * 0.2 = 0.4. So, P(E) = 0.8 + 0.4 = 0.8.

Now we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8
         = 0.15 / 1
         = 0.15

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 or 15%.
