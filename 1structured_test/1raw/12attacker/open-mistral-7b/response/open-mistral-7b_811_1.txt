Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender and a 20% error rate. However, we don't know the exact gender distribution in the population from which the attacker was drawn. Let's assume for now that the gender distribution in the relevant population is the same as the city's population (85% female, 15% male).

The witness identified the attacker as male. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, there's a 20% chance that the witness made a mistake and the attacker is actually female. This means that the witness was correct 80% of the time, and the attacker is actually male 80% of the time.

However, since the population is 85% female, there are more females than males in the population. If we only consider the fact that the attacker is in the population and not the witness's statement, we might expect the attacker to be female more often than male.

To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness being correct given the gender distribution in the population. This is the probability that the attacker is male, given the observation that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F). We know that P(M) + P(F) = 1, and P(M) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).

Given the witness's accuracy, we also know that P(M | Witness's statement) = 0.8. This means that the probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is 0.8.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(M) as follows:

P(M) = P(M | Witness's statement) * P(Witness's statement | M) / (P(M | Witness's statement) * P(Witness's statement | M) + P(M | Witness's statement) * P(Witness's statement | F) * P(F))

Since P(M | Witness's statement) = 0.8 and the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(Witness's statement | F) = 0.2.

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(Witness's statement | M) and P(F). Without this information, we cannot provide a precise estimate for P(M).

In conclusion, based on the given information, we cannot provide a numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is male. We can only conclude that the probability is greater than 0.15 (since the witness identified the attacker as male, and we know that the attacker is male 15% of the time in the population) and less than 0.8 (since the witness is not always correct).
