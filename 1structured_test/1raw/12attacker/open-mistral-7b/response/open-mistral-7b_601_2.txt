To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's reliability in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the population.

Let's denote the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as M, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as 1-M (since the total probability for a male must be 1).

The witness incorrectly identifies a male 20% of the time, so M = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now, let's consider the population distribution. If 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, let F be the probability of picking a female and M be the probability of picking a male. So, F = 0.85 and M = 0.15.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a male 20% of the time, the probability that the witness identifies a male and it's actually a female is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

However, we don't know if the witness made an error or if the attacker is actually female. So, we need to adjust our estimate for the probability of the attacker being male based on this error.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male and the attacker being male is M * M = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as a male and the attacker being female is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Since we don't know which of these two scenarios happened, we should add their probabilities to get an estimate of the overall probability of the attacker being male.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is P(attacker is male) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 or 15%.
