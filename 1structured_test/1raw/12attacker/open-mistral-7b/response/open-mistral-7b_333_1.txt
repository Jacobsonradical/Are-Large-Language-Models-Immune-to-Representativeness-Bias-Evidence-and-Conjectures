Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. However, a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender erred in identifying the attacker as male. Since we don't know if the witness made an error in this case, we cannot definitively say that the attacker is male.

Therefore, based on the information given, it is not possible to provide a strict probability estimate. However, if we consider the possibility of the witness making an error, we can say that the probability of the attacker being male might be lower than 15%, but it is certainly not 85%. Without more information, a precise estimate cannot be made.

{probability: Unable to provide a number between 0 and 1, given the information provided.}
