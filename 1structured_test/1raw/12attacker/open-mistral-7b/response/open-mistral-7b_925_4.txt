Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have specific information about the gender distribution in the witness's sample or how the witness identified the attacker in this specific case.

The second piece of information (b) tells us that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. But this does not necessarily reflect the gender distribution in the group that the witness observed.

Given these uncertainties, it's not possible to provide a precise probability estimate. However, if we were to make an assumption that the gender distribution in the witness's sample is similar to the city's population, we could potentially use the city's population distribution as a proxy. In this case, the probability that the attacker is male would be approximately 15%. But again, this is an assumption and the actual probability could be different.

{probability: 0.15, note: This is an estimate based on the assumption that the gender distribution in the witness's sample is similar to the city's population.}
