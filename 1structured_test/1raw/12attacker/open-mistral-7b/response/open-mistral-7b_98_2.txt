Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The population ratio of males to females in the city is 15% to 85%.
2. The witness, who has an accuracy rate of 80% in identifying gender, incorrectly identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both pieces of information.

Since the witness's error rate is 20%, this means that when they incorrectly identify a person's gender, they are more likely to mistake a female for a male than vice versa. This is because the ratio of males to females in the population is 1:4 (15% to 85%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, it is more likely that they made an error in this case, as the population ratio suggests that there are fewer males than females in the city. Therefore, we can infer that there is a higher probability that the attacker is actually female.

However, without more specific information about the witness's error rate when identifying males versus females or further context about the specific situation, it is impossible to provide a precise probability estimate.

In summary, while it is more likely that the attacker is female, based on the population ratio and the witness's error rate, we cannot provide a numerical probability estimate with certainty.
