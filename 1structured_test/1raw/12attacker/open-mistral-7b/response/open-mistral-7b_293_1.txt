Given the two pieces of information provided, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. According to the first piece of information, the population composition is 85% female and 15% male.
2. However, we have a witness who, in similar conditions, correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

1. P(H) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, given that the city has a 15% male population.
2. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker (given that the attacker is male). This is the witness's reliability, which is 0.8 or 80%.
3. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker, regardless of whether the attacker is male or female. This probability can be calculated using the prior probability of the attacker being male and the witness's reliability: P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H), where ~H denotes the hypothesis that the attacker is female.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|~H) is 0.2 or 20%.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

After calculating, we find that the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.26 or 26%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.26}
