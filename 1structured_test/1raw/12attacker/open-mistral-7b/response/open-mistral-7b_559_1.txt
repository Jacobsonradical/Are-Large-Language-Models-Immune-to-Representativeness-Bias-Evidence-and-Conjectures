The information provided can be analyzed as follows:

1. We know that the population is 85% female and 15% male.
2. However, we also have a witness who, under similar conditions, correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male.

Now, let's think about this situation:

1. If the attacker were actually female, the witness would have incorrectly identified the gender 20% of the time (given their accuracy rate).
2. Since the witness did not make an error, it means the attacker must be male according to the witness's account.
3. However, we should consider the possibility of the witness making a correct identification due to chance, even if the attacker is female.
4. To do this, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification by chance, given that the attacker is female.
5. With a 20% error rate, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a female as female is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
6. Since the witness did not make an error, this means the probability of the attacker being female, given the witness's account, is essentially 0.

However, we cannot completely ignore the possibility of the attacker being female due to the city's demographics. Therefore, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male based on the city's population and the witness's accuracy rate (assuming the witness is always correct in this case).

The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. The witness's accuracy rate is 80%. If the witness is always correct, the probability of the attacker being male is 15%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, considering both the city's demographics and the witness's accuracy rate, would be a weighted average of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 1 = 0.18, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This means the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.18 or 18%.
