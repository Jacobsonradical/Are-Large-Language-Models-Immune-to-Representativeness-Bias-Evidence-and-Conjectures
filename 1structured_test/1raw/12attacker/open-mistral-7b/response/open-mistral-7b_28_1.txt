To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided about the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errors 20% of the time.
2. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(Male) and the probability of the attacker being female as P(Female) = 1 - P(Male).

The witness's error rate can be interpreted as the probability of misidentifying the gender of a person, so P(Misidentify | Male) = 0.2 and P(Misidentify | Female) = 0.2.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we would like to know the probability that the attacker is actually male, given this observation. This probability can be calculated as follows:

P(Male | Witness Identified as Male) = P(Witness Identified as Male | Male) * P(Male) / [P(Witness Identified as Male | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness Identified as Male | Female) * P(Female)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Male | Witness Identified as Male) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating the probability, we get:

P(Male | Witness Identified as Male) â‰ˆ 0.221

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.221 or 22.1%.
