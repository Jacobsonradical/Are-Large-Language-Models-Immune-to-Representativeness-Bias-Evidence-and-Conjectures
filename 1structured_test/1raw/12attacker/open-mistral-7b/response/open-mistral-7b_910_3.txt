To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can consider this a correct identification with probability 0.8, or a mistake with probability 0.2.

Given that 85% of the city's population is female, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85. The probability that the witness's identification is a mistake given that the attacker is female is 0.2.

However, we cannot directly use this probability, as it assumes that the gender distribution among the people the witness incorrectly identifies is the same as in the city as a whole. Since the witness errs more often in identifying females (20% of the time), it's reasonable to assume that the gender distribution among the people the witness mistakes is skewed.

To account for this, let's assume that among the people the witness mistakenly identifies, the proportion of females is lower than in the city as a whole. Let's use the value 0.7 as a plausible estimate for this proportion.

The probability that the witness mistakes a female for a male is then 0.7 * 0.2 = 0.14.

The probability that the witness mistakes a male for a female is 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the probability that the witness made a correct identification, which is 0.8.

However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness mistakenly identified a female as male, which would lead to an overestimation of the probability that the attacker is male.

The probability of this mistake is 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.12.

The probability that the attacker is male, considering this possibility, is then 0.8 - 0.12 = 0.68.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.68.
