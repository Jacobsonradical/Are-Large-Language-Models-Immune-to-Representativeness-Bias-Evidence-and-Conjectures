To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's accuracy: In a sample of people, half female and half male, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. This means that the witness errs in 20% of the cases.

However, we need to adjust the error rate to account for the population distribution. Since 85% of the population is female, the witness is more likely to see females in their daily life. This could potentially skew their ability to accurately identify males, increasing the error rate.

Let's assume that the witness's error rate is actually higher when it comes to identifying males, and let's call this additional error rate "e". Then, the actual probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as a female is e.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8 - e.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identified a male. So, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 - e.

Without more information about the witness's bias or the actual error rate, it's not possible to provide a specific number for e. Therefore, we can't provide a precise probability that the attacker is male.
