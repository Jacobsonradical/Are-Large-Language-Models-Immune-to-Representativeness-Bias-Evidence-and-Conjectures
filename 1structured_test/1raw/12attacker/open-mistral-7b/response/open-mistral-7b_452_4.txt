Given the information provided, we have two pieces of evidence:

1. The population composition in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.

However, it's important to note that the witness's observation is separate from the population distribution. The witness's identification could be an error, given their error rate of 20%.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male). We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(male) = P(witness said male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) / [P(witness said male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness said male | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female)]

We are given P(witness said male | attacker is male) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time) and P(witness said male | attacker is female) = 0 (since the witness always identifies females as females, and in this case, we don't have any information about the witness's error rate when identifying females as males)

The population distribution is P(attacker is male) = 0.15 and P(attacker is female) = 0.85

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(male) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85]

P(male) = 0.12 / 0.12 = 1

However, this result is not valid because the probability of an event should always be between 0 and 1. This inconsistency arises because the witness's ability to identify the gender of the attacker is not taken into account in the population distribution.

To provide a more accurate estimate, we would need additional information about the witness's performance when identifying genders under conditions similar to the night of the attack. If we had such information, we could adjust the 0.8 value used in the Bayes' theorem calculation accordingly.

In the absence of this information, it's not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.
