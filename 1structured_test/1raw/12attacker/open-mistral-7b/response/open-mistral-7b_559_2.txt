To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to estimate
- P(E|H): The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male given that he is male
- P(E|~H): The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as male given that he is female
- P(~H): The prior probability of the attacker being female

Given the information provided, we can calculate these probabilities as follows:
- P(H) = 15% (from b)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (from a)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (from a)
- P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 85% (from b)

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the values, we get:
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this, we find that the probability that the attacker is male, given the evidence, is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
