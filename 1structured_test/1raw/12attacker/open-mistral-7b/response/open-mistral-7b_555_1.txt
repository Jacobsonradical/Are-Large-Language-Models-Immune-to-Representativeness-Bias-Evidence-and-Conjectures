To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M). The probability of the witness erring in identifying the attacker's gender, given that the attacker is male, is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (as stated in the information provided).

Given the gender distribution in the city, the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).

The witness's statement indicates that they identified the attacker as male. Given this, the probability of the witness's statement being correct is the probability of the attacker being male (P(M)) multiplied by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, and the probability of the witness's statement being incorrect is the probability of the attacker being male multiplied by the probability of the witness erring in identifying a male attacker:

P(Witness's statement is correct) = P(M) * 0.8
P(Witness's statement is incorrect) = P(M) * 0.2

However, we are given that the witness did indeed identify the attacker as male. This means that we are interested in the probability that the witness's statement is correct, which is P(Witness's statement is correct) = P(M) * 0.8.

To find the value of P(M) that makes this probability equal to the witness's reported accuracy of 80%, we can set up the equation:

P(M) * 0.8 = 0.8

To solve for P(M), we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:

P(M) = 1

However, this value is not within the required range of 0 to 1. This implies that the witness's reported accuracy of 80% cannot be correct, given the information about the gender distribution in the city.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to estimate a probability for the attacker being male that is between 0 and 1. This suggests that there is some inconsistency or missing information in the given information.
