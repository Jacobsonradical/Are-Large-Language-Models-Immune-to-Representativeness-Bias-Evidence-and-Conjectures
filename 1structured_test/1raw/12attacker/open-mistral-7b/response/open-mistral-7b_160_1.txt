To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event "the attacker is male" and B is the event "the witness identified the attacker as male."

We are given the following values:

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male. We don't have this value, but we can estimate it based on the city's population. From the information given, we know that 15% of the population is male, so P(A) = 0.15.

2. P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

3. P(B|¬A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, and half of the people in the sample are female, we can calculate this value: P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1

4. P(¬A) is the prior probability of the attacker being female. This can be calculated as P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

5. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying anyone as male. This can be calculated as P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.21 ≈ 0.524

So, based on the witness's testimony and the city's population gender distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 52.4%.
