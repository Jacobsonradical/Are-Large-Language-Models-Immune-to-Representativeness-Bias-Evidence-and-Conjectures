To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual distribution of genders in the city.

First, let's consider the witness's reliability. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time.

Second, let's consider the actual distribution of genders in the city. According to the information given, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually female:

1. The probability that the attacker is female is 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female).
2. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male is 0.2 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time).

So, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female, is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male:

1. The probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).
2. The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male is 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time).

So, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the sum of these two probabilities:

probability = probability of correct identification + probability of incorrect identification
probability = 0.12 + 0.17
probability = 0.29 or 29%

So, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 29%.
