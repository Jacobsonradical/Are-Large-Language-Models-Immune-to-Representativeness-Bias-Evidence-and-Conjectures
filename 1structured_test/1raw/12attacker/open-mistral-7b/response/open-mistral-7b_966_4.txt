To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). The probability that the witness misidentifies a female as male is the error rate given in the first piece of information, which is 20%. Similarly, the probability that the witness misidentifies a male as female is also 20%.

Since 85% of the population is female, the probability that the victim is female is 0.85, and the probability that the victim is male is 0.15.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that they were correct (the attacker is male) is their accuracy rate for identifying males, which is 0.8. The probability that they were wrong (the attacker is female) is their error rate for identifying females, which is 0.2.

So, we have two events:
1. Event A: Witness correctly identifies male attacker. Probability = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
2. Event B: Witness incorrectly identifies female attacker as male. Probability = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

The probability that the witness made an error (event B) given that they identified the attacker as male is the conditional probability of event B given event A. This can be calculated as:

P(B|A) = P(B) / P(A)

Substituting the probabilities, we get:

P(B|A) = 0.17 / 0.12 = 1.417

Since the probability of an event cannot be greater than 1, this suggests that there might be an issue with the witness's accuracy rate or the gender distribution in the city. However, assuming that the witness's accuracy rate is correct, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)], where A is the event that the attacker is male and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Substituting the probabilities, we get:

P(male) = [P(B|male) * P(male)] / [P(B)]

Using the values given, we can calculate P(male) as:

P(male) = [0.12 * 0.15] / [0.12 + 0.17] = 0.0962

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 9.62%. However, as mentioned earlier, the values for the error rate and the gender distribution seem to suggest an inconsistency, so this estimate should be interpreted with caution.
