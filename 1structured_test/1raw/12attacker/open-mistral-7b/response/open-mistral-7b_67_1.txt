To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make some assumptions.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is female and 15% is male (information "a"), and considering that the witness has an accuracy rate of 80% in identifying gender (information "b"), we can calculate the probability of the witness misidentifying a female as a male.

If the attacker is actually female (which happens 85% of the time), then the witness will incorrectly identify her as male 20% of the time (given that the witness's error rate is 20%).

So, the probability of the witness misidentifying a female as a male is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Now, we know that the witness identified the attacker as male, but there's a 17% chance that they're incorrect. This means that there's a chance that the attacker is actually female, and the witness incorrectly identified them as male. To find this probability, we can subtract the witness's error rate from 1:

1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%)

This means that there's an 83% chance that the attacker is female, given the witness's statement, and the distribution of gender in the city.

However, the original question asks for the probability that the attacker is male. Since we know that the witness's statement is incorrect 17% of the time, and they incorrectly identified the attacker as male, we can calculate the probability of this happening by multiplying the witness's error rate by the probability of the attacker being female:

0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%)

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the distribution of gender in the city, is 17%.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.17}
