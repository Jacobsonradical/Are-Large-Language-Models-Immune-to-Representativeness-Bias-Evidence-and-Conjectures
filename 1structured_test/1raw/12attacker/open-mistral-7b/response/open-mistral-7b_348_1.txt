To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our prior beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's gender identification, and our prior belief is the population distribution of males and females in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male (we don't have this information, but we can use the population distribution as an approximation)
- P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female (1 - P(M))
- P(w|M) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker
- P(w|F) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(M|w) = [P(w|M) * P(M)] / [P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)]

We have the following information:
1. P(w|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time)
2. P(w|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the gender 20% of the time)
3. P(M) = unknown, but we can approximate it with the population distribution of males in the city, which is 15% (from information b)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male (P(M|w)) is:
P(M|w) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
