Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the reliability of the witness and the gender distribution in the population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The gender distribution in the population: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The witness identified the attacker as male. If the attacker is actually female, this would be an error. So we need to calculate the probability of the witness making such an error.

The probability of the witness making an error (mistaking a female for a male) is the proportion of times the witness errs:

P(error) = Proportion of times witness errs
               = 20%
               = 0.2

Now, we know that 85% of the population is female. So the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85.

The probability of the witness making an error (mistaking a female for a male) given that the attacker is female is P(error | female) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

P(male | witnessed as male) = [P(witnessed as male | male) * P(male)] / [P(witnessed as male | male) * P(male) + P(witnessed as male | female) * P(female)]

Plugging in the values:

P(male | witnessed as male) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]
                                          = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
                                          = 0.12 / 0.29
                                          = 0.414

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.414 or 41.4%.
