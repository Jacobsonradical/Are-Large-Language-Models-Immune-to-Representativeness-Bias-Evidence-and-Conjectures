To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to account for the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time.
2. The city has an 85% female population and a 15% male population.

Let's consider two scenarios:

Scenario A: The witness correctly identifies the attacker as male. In this case, the attacker is indeed male.
Probability of Scenario A = 15% (the probability of drawing a male person from the city's population)

Scenario B: The witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male. In this case, the attacker is actually female, but the witness mistakes her for a male.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of this scenario is equal to the probability of drawing a female from the city's population times the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying her as male.

Probability of Scenario B = 0.85 (the probability of drawing a female person from the city's population) * 0.2 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

Now, we need to find the total probability of both scenarios. Since they are mutually exclusive events, we can simply add their probabilities:

Total probability = Probability of Scenario A + Probability of Scenario B
                         = 0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0.2
                         = 0.15 + 0.17
                         = 0.32

Since the witness did identify the attacker as male, we should consider only the probability of Scenario A as the actual probability of the attacker being male:

{probability: 0.15}
