Given the information provided, let's reason through this problem:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, and their error rate is 20%.
2. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.
3. We don't have information about the demographic of the area where the attack occurred, so we cannot assume that the attacker was more likely to be from one gender than the other.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is written as P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E), where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We have the following values:
- P(E|H) = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying male)
- P(H) = 0.15 (probability of a person being male in the city)
- P(E) = 0.8 (probability of the witness identifying someone as male, which is a combination of P(E|H) and P(E|~H))

To find P(E|H), we can use the witness's accuracy in identifying gender:
1 - error rate = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

So, P(E|H) = 0.8

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.8)

P(H|E) = 0.12

So, based on the witness's identification and the population statistics, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
