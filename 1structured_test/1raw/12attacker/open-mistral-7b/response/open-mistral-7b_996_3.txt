Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male by considering the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 20% (since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time). Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 1 - 20% = 80%.

The probability of the witness identifying a male as male is P(male) * 100%, and the probability of the witness identifying a female as male is 15% * (1 - P(male)) * 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we have the equation:

P(male) * 100% = 80% + 15% * (1 - P(male)) * 20%

To solve for P(male), we can simplify the equation:

P(male) * 100% = 0.8 + 0.15 * (1 - P(male)) * 0.2
P(male) * 100% = 0.8 + 0.03 * (1 - P(male))
P(male) * 100% - 0.03 * (1 - P(male)) = 0.8
0.97 * P(male) - 0.03 * P(male) = 0.8
0.94 * P(male) = 0.8
P(male) â‰ˆ 0.862

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.862 or 86.2%.
