Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness, who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city. Since the witness misidentifies gender 20% of the time, we can consider this as an error rate.

Let's start by calculating the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker:

Probability of witness correctly identifying male = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy)

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness erring and misidentifying a female attacker as male:

Probability of witness erring and misidentifying female as male = 0.2 (the witness's error rate) * 0.85 (probability of attacker being female)

Since the witness's errors and correct identifications are independent events, we can multiply their probabilities to find the overall probability of the witness identifying a female as male:

Probability of witness identifying female as male = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can find the probability of the attacker being male by subtracting the probability of the witness identifying a female as male from the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male:

Probability of attacker being male = 0.8 - 0.17 = 0.63

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.63 (63%).
