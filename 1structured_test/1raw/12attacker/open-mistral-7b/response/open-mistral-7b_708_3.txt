To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M) and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F) = 1 - P(M).

The witness's accuracy in identifying gender can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial with probability of success p = 0.8. In this context, a "success" means correctly identifying the gender of a person.

The witness saw the attacker from behind, so they could only make a gender identification based on their prior knowledge and assumptions. Given that they identified the attacker as male, this can be considered a success with probability p = 0.8.

The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, which can be represented as P(F) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15.

However, we should consider the possibility of the witness's bias, as they are more likely to see more females in their daily life due to the city's gender distribution. This could potentially influence their ability to correctly identify a male attacker.

Since the witness's ability to judge gender is not perfect (20% error rate), we should adjust the observed probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's accuracy.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the actual probability that the attacker is male is likely higher than the observed 15%. To estimate this probability, we can multiply the observed probability P(M) by the witness's success probability p = 0.8:

P(M | observed) = P(M) * p = 0.15 * 0.8 â‰ˆ 0.12

This estimated probability suggests that, given the witness's accuracy and the city's gender distribution, the attacker is likely male with a probability of approximately 12%.

However, this estimation may be an underestimation due to the witness's potential bias. Considering that the witness is more likely to see females in their daily life, they might have been more cautious when identifying the attacker as male, which could lead to an underestimation of the actual probability of the attacker being male.

Therefore, while the estimated probability of the attacker being male is approximately 12%, this value should be interpreted with caution as it may be an underestimation due to the witness's potential bias.
