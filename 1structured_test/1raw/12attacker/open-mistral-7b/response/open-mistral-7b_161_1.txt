To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, and the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we can calculate the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a female as male.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, the probability of correctly identifying a male is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of selecting a female randomly in the city is 0.85. If the witness incorrectly identifies this female as male, the probability of this event is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

So, the probability of having a witness error in this specific scenario (mistaking a female for a male) is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Now, we need to consider the witness's statement that the attacker is male. Since there is a 0.17 probability of the witness being wrong about a female being male, and a 0.15 probability of the actual attacker being male (given the city's population distribution), the probability of both events occurring (witness error and actual male attacker) is their product: 0.17 * 0.15 = 0.0255 or 2.55%.

However, the witness's statement also implies that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender. In this case, the probability of having a male attacker is 0.15.

Since the witness's statement cannot be both correct and incorrect at the same time, we must consider only the scenario where the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender. In this case, the probability of having a male attacker is 0.15.

Therefore, the strict estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.15}. This means that, given the information provided, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is male.
