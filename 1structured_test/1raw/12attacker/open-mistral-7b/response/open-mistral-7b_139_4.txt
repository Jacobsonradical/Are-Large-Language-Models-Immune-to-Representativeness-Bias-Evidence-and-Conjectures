Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis given evidence is equal to the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis, divided by the likelihood of the evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, the evidence is that the witness identified the attacker as male, and we are given the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the population.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(W|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(W|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(W) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male

From the given information, we can calculate the following probabilities:
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female 20% of the time)
- P(F) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female, so the probability of a random person being female is 0.15)
- P(M) = ? (the probability we are trying to find)

We are also given that P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

Now we can solve for P(M):

P(M) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(M) = (0.8 * P(M)) / (0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * 0.15)

To find the numerical value for P(M), we need to solve this equation. However, without a numerical value for P(M) in the equation, it's not possible to give a direct answer.

To approximate the probability, we can use trial and error or numerical methods to find the value of P(M) that makes the equation equal to the probability given by the witness. This would require a more complex mathematical solution or a numerical solver.

Therefore, I cannot provide a direct numerical answer to the question, but I can say that the probability that the attacker is male is likely to be less than 0.8 and greater than 0, depending on the exact value of P(M) that satisfies the equation.
