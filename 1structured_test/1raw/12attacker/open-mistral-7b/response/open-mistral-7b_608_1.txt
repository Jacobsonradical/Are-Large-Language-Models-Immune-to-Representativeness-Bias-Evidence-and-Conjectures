Given the two pieces of information, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

First, we know that the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. Then, we have the information that a witness, who was able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formal expression of Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) \* P(H) / P(E)

where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is male),
- E is the evidence (the witness said the attacker is male),
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of males in the population),
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male),
- P(H | E) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (the estimated probability that the attacker is male),
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the overall probability that the witness makes the statement "the attacker is male").

Since we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we are interested in P(H | E). We know the value of P(H) and P(E | H), so we need to find the values of P(E) and P(H | E).

The probability of the evidence P(E) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the evidence given each hypothesis, times the probability of each hypothesis:

P(E) = P(E | H) \* P(H) + P(E | ¬H) \* P(¬H)

where ¬H means "not H", that is, the attacker is female. We are given that the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, so P(E | H) = 0.8 and P(E | ¬H) = 0.2. We also know the proportion of males in the population, so P(H) = 0.15 and P(¬H) = 0.85.

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H | E):

P(H | E) = P(E | H) \* P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.31

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the evidence, is approximately 0.31 or 31%.
