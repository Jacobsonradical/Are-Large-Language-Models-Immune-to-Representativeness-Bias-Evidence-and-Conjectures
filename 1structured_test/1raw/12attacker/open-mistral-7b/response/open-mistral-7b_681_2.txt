Given the information provided, we have two sources of probability estimates for the attacker's gender:

1. The population distribution of the city: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy in gender identification: 80% correct, 20% incorrect.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can use their accuracy rate as a probability estimate for this specific event. However, it's important to note that this event might not be representative of the witness's ability in general due to the specific circumstances of the attack.

Given that the witness was 80% accurate in gender identification, and they identified the attacker as male, we can estimate that the attacker is actually male 80% of the time.

Therefore, the probability estimate that the attacker is male is: {probability: 0.8}
