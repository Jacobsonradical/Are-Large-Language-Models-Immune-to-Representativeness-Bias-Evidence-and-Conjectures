Given the two pieces of information:
1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male (as mentioned in point 'a').
2. A witness, who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male (as mentioned in point 'b').

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the likelihood of a male attacker in the general population and the reliability of the witness's gender identification.

Let's denote the probability of a male attacker as M. According to point 'a', M = 0.15.

Point 'b' tells us that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker is 0.8.

However, we also need to account for the fact that the witness makes errors when identifying gender. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, there is a 0.2 probability that the witness erroneously identifies a female as a male.

Since the attacker's gender is unknown, we can consider both possibilities:
1. The attacker is indeed male with probability M = 0.15. In this case, the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male with probability 0.8.
2. The attacker is female with probability 1 - M = 0.85. Despite the attacker being female, the witness erroneously identifies the attacker as male with probability 0.2.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker (regardless of the actual gender of the attacker):

P(witness identifies male) = P(attacker is male) * P(witness correctly identifies male) + P(attacker is female) * P(witness erroneously identifies male)

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(witness identifies male) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
