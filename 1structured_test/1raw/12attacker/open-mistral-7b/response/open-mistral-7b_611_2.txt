To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that relates the probability of an event A to the probability of another event B, given that A and B are related. In this case, A is the attacker being male, and B is the witness's gender identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Let's break down the terms:

- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we don't have direct information about but can estimate based on the city's gender distribution.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying a male as male, which is given as 0.8.
- P(not A) is the probability of the attacker being female, which is 1 - P(A).
- P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying a female as male, which is given as 0.2.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can estimate P(A) to be 0.15 (15%).

Now, we can calculate P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A):

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.182 = 0.302

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.302 â‰ˆ 0.249

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.249 or 24.9%.
