To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H: attacker is male) given the evidence (E: witness identification),
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis,
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (i.e., the probability of the hypothesis before considering the evidence),
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (i.e., the probability of the witness's identification, regardless of the attacker's gender).

From the information provided, we have:
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male, given that 85% of the city's population is female)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (the probability of the witness's identification, regardless of the attacker's gender)

Now, we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)
                 = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
                 ≈ 0.275

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.275 or 27.5%.
