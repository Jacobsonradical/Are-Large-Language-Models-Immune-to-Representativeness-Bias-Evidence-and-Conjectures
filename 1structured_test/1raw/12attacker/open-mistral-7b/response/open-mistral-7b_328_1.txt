To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- p as the witness's probability of correctly identifying a male (0.8)
- q as the witness's probability of incorrectly identifying a male (1 - p = 0.2)
- f as the proportion of females in the city (0.85)
- m as the proportion of males in the city (1 - f = 0.15)

According to the witness, the attacker is male with probability p or female with probability q. However, since the witness couldn't see the attacker's gender, their statement about the attacker's gender being male is equivalent to observing a random draw from the population with a probability of m.

The likelihood of the witness's statement given the attacker being male is P(M) * p + P(F) * q.

Since the witness said the attacker is male, we want to find the value of P(M) that maximizes this likelihood.

The maximum likelihood estimate for P(M) is given by:

P(M) = (P(M) * p + P(F) * q) / (p + q)

Plugging in the given values:

P(M) = ((P(M) * 0.8) + (P(F) * 0.2)) / (0.8 + 0.2)

P(M) = (0.8P(M) + 0.2 * 0.85) / 1

P(M) = 0.8P(M) + 0.17

P(M) = 0.17 / (1 - 0.8)

P(M) = 0.17 / 0.2

P(M) = 0.85

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.85.
