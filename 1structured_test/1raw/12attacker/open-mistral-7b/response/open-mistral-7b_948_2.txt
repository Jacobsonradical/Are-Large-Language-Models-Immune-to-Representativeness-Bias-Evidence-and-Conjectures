Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and incorrectly identify gender is 20%.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is that the attacker is male.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In our case, A is the event that the attacker is male, B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male, P(A|B) is what we want to find (probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male), P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male (which we know is 0.8), P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (which we need to estimate based on the city's population), and P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies anyone as male (which is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|~A), where ~A is the event that the attacker is female).

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8, P(~A) = 0.85 (since the city is 85% female), and P(~A|B) = 1 - P(A|B) * P(A) / P(~A) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female 20% of the time).

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)] = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.26 = 0.27.

So, our estimate is that the attacker is likely to be male with a probability of 0.27. This means that there is a 27% chance that the attacker is male, given the evidence.
