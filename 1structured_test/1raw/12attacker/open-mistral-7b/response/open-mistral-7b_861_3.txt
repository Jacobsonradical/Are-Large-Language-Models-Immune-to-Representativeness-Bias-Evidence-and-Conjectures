Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can be used to estimate the probability that the attacker is male:

1. The city's population composition: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy in gender identification: 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, the second piece of information is not directly applicable to the attacker's gender, as it refers to a sample of people, not the specific attacker. Therefore, we cannot use this information to adjust the city's population ratio.

So, based on the city's population composition alone, the probability that the attacker is male is 15%, or {probability: 0.15}.
