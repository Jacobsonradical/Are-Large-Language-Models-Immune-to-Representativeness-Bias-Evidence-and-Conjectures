Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the new evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:
P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (witness's statement)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying male attackers)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of an attacker being male in the population)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness's statement)

Given that the witness's accuracy in identifying male attackers is 80%, we can calculate P(E | H) = 0.8.

Given that the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male).

To calculate P(E), we need to find the probability of the witness making a statement that identifies an attacker as male, given that the attacker is either male or female. This can be calculated as:

P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H)

Where ¬H means "not H," or the attacker is female.

Given that the witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, and the population is 85% female, we can calculate P(E | ¬H) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness erring and identifying a female attacker as male).

Calculating P(¬H) = 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being female), we can find P(E) = 0.12 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.104

Now we can calculate P(H | E):
P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.104 ≈ 0.117

The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 11.7%.
