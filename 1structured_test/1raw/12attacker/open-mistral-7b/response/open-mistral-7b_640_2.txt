To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Given these facts, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In our case,
- A: Attacker is male
- B: Witness identifies attacker as male

We know:
- P(B|A): Probability that the witness identifies a male as male = 1 (since we are assuming the attacker is indeed male in this case)
- P(A): Probability that the attacker is male = the probability we want to find
- P(B|not A): Probability that the witness identifies a female as male = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (given that 15% of the population is male and the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying males)
- P(not A): Probability that the attacker is female = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.12 * 0.85]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.102) = 0.138 or 13.8%.
