To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(M) and the probability that the attacker is female as P(F) = 1 - P(M).

The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this means that the actual attacker is indeed male in 80% of the cases when the witness correctly identifies the gender, and the attacker is actually female in the remaining 20% of the cases when the witness makes an error.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is female, the probability of randomly choosing a female is P(F) = 0.85. The probability of randomly choosing a male is P(M) = 1 - P(F) = 0.15.

When the witness correctly identifies a male, the probability that the actual attacker is male is P(M|Correct) = 1. When the witness makes an error and identifies a female as male, the probability that the actual attacker is male is P(M|Error) = P(F) = 0.85.

The overall probability that the witness correctly identifies a male (i.e., the attacker is actually male) is P(M) * P(Correct|M) + P(F) * P(Correct|Error) = 0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.15 + 0.68 = 0.83.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.83} with a confidence level of 83%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the witness's ability to identify gender and the gender distribution in the city, and it may not accurately reflect the true probability in this specific case.
