Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that if A and B are two events, then the probability of A given B (P(A|B)) can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, A is the event "attacker is male" and B is the event "witness identified attacker as male."

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to find.
2. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, which is given as 0.8 (80%).
3. P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, which is given as 0.2 (20%).
4. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, which can be calculated as P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A).

Since 50% of the population is male and 50% is female, P(A) = 0.5 and P(~A) = 0.5.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5]

Calculating this gives us a probability of approximately 0.64 or 64%.

However, there is an additional piece of information given that 85% of the population in the city is female. This might affect the probability of the attacker being male. Let's consider this now.

Given that 85% of the population is female, it suggests that the likelihood of an attacker being male is lower than 50%. So, our initial estimate of 0.64 might be too high.

To adjust for this, we can use Bayes' theorem again, this time considering the prior probability of the attacker being male to be lower than 0.5. Let's say we reduce it to 0.3 (30%).

Using Bayes' theorem again with this new prior probability, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.3] / [0.8 * 0.3 + 0.2 * 0.7]

Calculating this gives us a probability of approximately 0.48 or 48%.

So, considering both pieces of information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is around 0.48 or 48%.
