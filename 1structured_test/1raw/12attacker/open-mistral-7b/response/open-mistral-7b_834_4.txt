Based on the provided information, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender and errs 20% of the time identified the attacker as male.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time. So, when they say the attacker is male, there's a 20% chance that they're mistaken and the attacker is actually female.
2. Since the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, there are more females than males in the population. This means that the probability of a random attacker being female is higher than the probability of a random attacker being male.
3. However, because the witness is more likely to mistake a female for a male than the other way around (due to their 80% accuracy), they might have identified a female as male.
4. To estimate the probability of the attacker being male, we need to consider both the witness's error rate and the city's population distribution.

Let's calculate the probability:

1. Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female.
2. We know that P(M) + P(F) = 1 (since the attacker must be either male or female).
3. The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, meaning that P(M) * 0.8 + P(F) * 0.2 = 0.8 (the witness's correct identifications).
4. Since the city's population is 85% female, P(F) = 0.85, and P(M) = 1 - P(F) = 0.15.
5. However, the witness also errs 20% of the time, meaning that they mistakenly identify a female as male 20% of the time. This means that P(M) * 0.2 = 0.15 (the witness's errors).
6. Solving these two equations for P(M) gives us P(M) = 0.075 (approximately 7.5%).

So, based on the provided information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 7.5% (approximately). This estimate takes into account both the witness's error rate and the city's population distribution. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate and not a definitive answer, as there may be other factors not included in the information provided.
