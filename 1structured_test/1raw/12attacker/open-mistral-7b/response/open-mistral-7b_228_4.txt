To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know the gender of the attacker, we can't directly apply the witness's accuracy rate. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A divided by the probability of B.

Let A be the event that the attacker is male and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information given, we have:

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to find.
2. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, which is given as 0.8.
3. P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, which we can't directly calculate but can be found by subtracting P(B|A) from 1. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(B|~A) = 0.2.
4. P(A) = 0.15 (from the information that 85% of the population is female)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating the values, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.188, or 18.8%.
