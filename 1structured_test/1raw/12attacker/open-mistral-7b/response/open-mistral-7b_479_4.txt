To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.

Let's assume that the attacker's gender is actually X (either female or male). The probability of the witness identifying X as male is P(witness_identifies_male|X=male) = 0.8 (from the witness's reliability), and the probability of the witness identifying X as female is P(witness_identifies_male|X=female) = 0.2 (from the witness's reliability).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write an equation:

P(witness_identifies_male) = P(witness_identifies_male|X=male) * P(X=male) + P(witness_identifies_male|X=female) * P(X=female)

We know that P(witness_identifies_male) = 0.8 (from the witness's reliability), P(X=male) = 0.15, and P(X=female) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation, we have:

0.8 = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

Solving for P(X=male), we get:

P(X=male) â‰ˆ 0.197

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 19.7%.
