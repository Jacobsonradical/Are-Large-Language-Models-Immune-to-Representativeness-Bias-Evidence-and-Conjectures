Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80% and their error rate is 20%. This means that when the witness is presented with a person, they will correctly identify the gender as male 0.8 times and as female 0.2 times.

However, we don't have enough information to know the exact gender distribution in the group of people from which the attacker was chosen. The witness's accuracy rate is based on a 50/50 gender split, but in the city, 85% of the population is female.

Assuming that the attacker was randomly chosen from the city's population, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male by calculating the probability of the witness making a correct identification, given the city's gender distribution.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(female). Since the total probability of all outcomes should sum up to 1, we have P(male) + P(female) = 1.

Given that the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, P(male) * 0.8 + P(female) * 0.2 = 0.8.

Also, given that 85% of the population is female, P(female) = 0.85.

Now we can solve for P(male): P(male) = (0.8 - 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8 = 0.6875.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's accuracy and the city's gender distribution, is approximately 0.6875 (or 68.75%).
