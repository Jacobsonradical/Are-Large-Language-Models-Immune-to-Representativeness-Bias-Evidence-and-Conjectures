Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male.
2. However, we also know that a witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is expressed as: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's accuracy)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of males in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (independent of the hypothesis)

Let's calculate:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying males)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the proportion of males in the city)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.65 (since the witness is equally good at identifying females)

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.65 â‰ˆ 0.185

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.185 or 18.5%. This estimate takes into account both the prior probability of the attacker being male (based on the city's demographics) and the witness's ability to accurately identify gender. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate, and actual probabilities in real-world situations can be influenced by a variety of factors.
