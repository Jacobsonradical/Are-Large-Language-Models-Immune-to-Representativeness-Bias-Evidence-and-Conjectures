To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's errors are more often in identifying males as females or females as males. Let's assume for now that the errors are evenly distributed (this assumption does not significantly affect the final result).

Since 85% of the population is female, we can infer that the attacker is more likely to be female based on population statistics. However, the witness identified the attacker as male, so we need to adjust our probability estimate based on the witness's reliability.

The probability of the witness being correct when identifying a male is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness being incorrect when identifying a male is 0.2 (20%). Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of the witness encountering a male in their sample is 0.15.

Therefore, the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, given that the witness is more likely to be correct when identifying a male than a female (0.8 vs. 0.2), it seems reasonable to adjust the initial population probability to account for the witness's reliability.

The initial probability that the attacker is male is 0.15, and the probability that the witness was correct when identifying a male is 0.12. If we assume that the witness's accuracy is higher than chance (which it should be, given their 80% success rate), then it seems reasonable to increase the probability that the attacker is male based on the witness's observation.

One way to do this is to multiply the initial probability by the probability that the witness was correct when identifying a male: 0.15 * 0.12 = 0.018 or 1.8%.

However, this seems too low given the witness's reliability. A more reasonable estimate might be to assume that the witness's accuracy is higher than chance for males but lower than chance for females. In this case, we could increase the probability that the attacker is male but not to the same extent as if the witness was always correct.

For example, we could increase the probability that the attacker is male to 0.25 (25%) to account for the witness's 80% accuracy rate.

Therefore, based on the available information, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is between 1.8% and 25%. However, this estimate is subject to uncertainty and should be treated with caution. A more definitive answer would require additional evidence or information.
