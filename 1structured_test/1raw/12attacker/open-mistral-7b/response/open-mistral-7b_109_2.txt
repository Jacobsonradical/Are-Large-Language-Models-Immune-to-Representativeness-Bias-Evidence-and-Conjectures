To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80% (correctly identifying male 80% of the time).
2. The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume that the witness saw the attacker for a long enough time to make a reliable gender judgment. In this scenario, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, we can calculate the probability of a correct identification as 1 - error rate = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now, let's consider the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male:

P(Male | Male identified) = P(Correct identification | Male) = 0.8

Similarly, let's consider the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female:

P(Male | Female identified) = P(Error | Female) = 0.2 * (Female probability)

Since the population is 85% female, we can find the probability of drawing a female from the population:

P(Female) = 0.85

Now we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female:

P(Male | Female identified) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male:

P(Male | Male identified) = P(Male identified | Male) * P(Male) / [P(Male identified | Male) * P(Male) + P(Male identified | Female) * P(Female)]

P(Male | Male identified) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85]

P(Male | Male identified) â‰ˆ 0.13

So, based on the witness's identification and the city's gender distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 13%.
