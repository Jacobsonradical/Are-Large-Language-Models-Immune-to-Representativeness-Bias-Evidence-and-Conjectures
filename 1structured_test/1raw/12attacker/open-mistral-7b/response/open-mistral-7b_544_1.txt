To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B (P(A|B)) can be calculated using the prior probability of event A (P(A)), the probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)), and the probability of event B (P(B)).

In our case, event A is the attacker being male, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

Given the information provided:
1. P(A) is the probability that the attacker is male, which we want to find.
2. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker, which is given as 1.
3. P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male, which can be calculated as 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.
4. P(B) is the overall probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender, which is given as 0.8.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.8 = 0.12

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
