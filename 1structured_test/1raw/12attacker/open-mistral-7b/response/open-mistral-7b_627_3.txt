Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the observed event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the information given, we have:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we don't have explicit information about, but we can infer from the city's population statistics. Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, P(A) = 0.15
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, which is given as 0.8 (80% correct)
- P(B|~A) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male, which can be calculated as 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2 (20% error)

We don't have explicit information about P(~A), the prior probability of the attacker being female, but we can calculate it using the city's population statistics and Bayes' theorem:

P(~A) = P(B|~A) * P(~A) / P(B)

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, P(B|~A) = 0.2

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, P(~A) = 0.85

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now we can estimate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.667 or 66.7%.
