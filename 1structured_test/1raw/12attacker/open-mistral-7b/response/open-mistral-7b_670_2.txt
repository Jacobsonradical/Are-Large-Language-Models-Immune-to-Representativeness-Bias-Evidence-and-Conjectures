Given the information provided, we have two sources of probability: the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. From the population distribution, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. This means that, on average, if we randomly select a person from the city, they have a 15% chance of being male (0.15).

2. The witness, however, is not perfectly accurate in identifying gender. They correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err 20% of the time. This means that even if a person is actually male, there's a 20% chance that the witness will mistakenly identify them as female.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we need to consider the possibility that this was a mistake. If the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, then there's a 20% chance that they misidentified a female as male.

So, the probability that the attacker is truly male, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness being correct minus the probability of the witness being wrong about a female being the attacker.

In mathematical terms, this can be represented as:

{probability: 0.8 - 0.15 * 0.2, probability: 0.64}

So, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, our estimate is that the attacker has a 64% chance of being male. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on limited information, and the actual probability could be different.
