Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being male.
- Event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

We know the following probabilities from the information provided:
- P(A) = Probability that the attacker is male in the population. This is the probability we want to find.
- P(B|A) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. This is given as 0.8 in the problem statement.
- P(B|~A) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female. This is given as 0.2 in the problem statement.
- P(~A) = Probability that the attacker is female in the population. This is 1 - P(A).
- P(B) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This is given by the product of the probabilities in A and B, P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A).

We are given the following information about P(B|A) and P(B|~A):
- P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(B|~A) = 0.2

We are also given the following information about the population:
- 85% of the population is female, so P(~A) = 0.85
- 15% of the population is male, so P(A) = 0.15

We can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
      = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
      = 0.12 / 0.29
      = 0.414

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.414 or 41.4%.
