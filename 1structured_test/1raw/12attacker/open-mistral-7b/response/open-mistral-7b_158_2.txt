To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote the following:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male (given that the attacker is male)
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male (given that the attacker is female)

From the information provided, we know that:
- P(M) + P(F) = 1 (since there are only two possible genders)
- P(w|M) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge gender)
- P(w|F) = 0.2 (from the witness's ability to judge gender)
- The population is 85% female and 15% male, so P(F) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement:

P(M|w) = P(w|M) * P(M) / [P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|w) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(M|w) â‰ˆ 0.1042

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 10.42%.
