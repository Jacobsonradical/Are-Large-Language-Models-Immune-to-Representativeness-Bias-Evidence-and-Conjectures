Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and errs 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. However, the attacker's gender is not known to be from the city's population.

The witness's error rate is independent of the population's gender distribution. Therefore, when the witness makes an error, it is equally likely to be a mistake in identifying a female as a male or vice versa.

The witness's statement indicates that they correctly identified the gender 80% of the time. This means that they incorrectly identified the gender 20% of the time. Since they identified the attacker as male, the probability that they made an error is 20%.

If they made an error, then the actual gender of the attacker is the opposite of what they identified. Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a female as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 or 83%.

However, it's important to note that this is a Bayesian estimate, and it depends on the assumption that the witness's error rate is independent of the population's gender distribution. If this assumption is not valid, then the estimate may not be accurate.
