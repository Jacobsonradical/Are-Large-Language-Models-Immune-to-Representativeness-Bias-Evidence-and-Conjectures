To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in determining gender, but errs 20% of the time.
2. We know that 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness Identification) = [P(Witness Identifies as Male) * P(Attacker is Male)] / [P(Witness Identifies as Male) * P(Attacker is Male) + P(Witness Identifies as Female) * P(Attacker is Female)]

First, let's find the probability of the witness identifying as male:

P(Witness Identifies as Male) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)

Now, we need to find the probability of the attacker being male:

P(Attacker is Male) = Number of Males / Total Population
                                    = 0.15
                                    = 0.15 / (0.85 + 0.15)
                                    = 0.15 / 1
                                    = 0.15

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15)]
                                                                         = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.08)
                                                                         = 0.12 / 0.2
                                                                         = 0.6

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.6 or 60%.
