Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness, in similar conditions, correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.

However, the attack occurred at night, and the victim could not see the attacker's gender. This means that the witness's ability to identify the attacker's gender is not applicable in this case.

Therefore, the best estimate we can make is based on the city's population demographics. Since 15% of the population is male, our estimate would be:

{probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
