To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. Witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. Gender distribution in the city: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Given that the witness could not see the attacker's face, we might assume that they are making gender determinations based on body shape or other physical characteristics. Since the attacker attacked from behind, these physical cues are likely to be less informative for gender identification than they would be if the witness had a full view of the attacker.

However, we do not have enough information to quantify this reduction in the witness's accuracy. Therefore, we will use the raw probability data provided.

The witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time, and they err 20% of the time. Since the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as:

0.8 (probability of correct identification) * 0.15 (probability of male in the population) = 0.12

This means that, based on the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city, there is a 12% chance that the attacker is male.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.12}
