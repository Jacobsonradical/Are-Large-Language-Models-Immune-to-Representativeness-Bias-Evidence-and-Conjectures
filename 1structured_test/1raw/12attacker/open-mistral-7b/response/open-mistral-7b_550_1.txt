Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and is used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement and the city's demographics.

The probability of the hypothesis (P(H)) is the probability that the attacker is male in the city's population. Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate P(H) as follows:

P(H) = 0.15 (probability of being male)

The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)) is the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a female as male, given that the attacker is indeed male. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate P(E|H) as follows:

P(E|H) = 0.2 (probability of error)

The prior probability of the evidence (P(E)) is the probability of the witness making the statement, regardless of the attacker's gender. This is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is male (P(E|H)) and given that the attacker is female (P(E|~H)), multiplied by the probabilities of the attacker being male (P(H)) and female (P(~H)), respectively:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a male as female, given that the attacker is indeed female. Since the witness's gender identification accuracy is the same for both genders, P(E|~H) should be equal to P(E|H). Therefore:

P(E) = 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability of the hypothesis (P(H|E)), which is the updated probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement, using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

P(H|E) ≈ 0.2 * 0.15 / 0.23 ≈ 0.117 (probability of the attacker being male)

Therefore, based on the provided information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 11.7%.
