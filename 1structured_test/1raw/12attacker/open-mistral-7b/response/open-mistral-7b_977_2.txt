To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know whether the witness's error was misidentifying a male as female or vice versa, we'll assume it's an even distribution of errors. This means the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 10% of the time and males as females 10% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the expected number of times the witness would incorrectly identify a male as female:

Expected errors = Total population * Error rate for males
               = 0.15 * 0.1
               = 0.015

Now, let's find the expected number of times the witness would correctly identify a male:

Expected correct identifications for males = Total population * Correct identification rate for males
                                  = 0.15 * 0.8
                                  = 0.12

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we know that the witness correctly identified a male or made an error in identifying a female as male. To find the probability of the latter, we can use the expected number of errors:

Probability of error = Expected errors / Total population
                 = 0.015 / 1
                 = 0.015

Now, since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male is equal to the probability of the witness making no error or only one error (correctly identifying a male):

Probability of attacker being male = Probability of no errors + Probability of one error
                        = (1 - 0.015) ^ 2 * 0.015 + (1 - 0.015) * 0.015
                        = 0.98485 * 0.00015 + 0.98485 * 0.00015
                        ≈ 0.000033 + 0.000033
                        ≈ 0.000066

Since it's not possible to have a probability less than 0, let's say that the attacker is likely to be male with a probability of approximately 0.66% (0.0066). This estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed and that the attacker's gender is independent of the witness's ability to identify gender. However, these assumptions might not be entirely accurate in real-world scenarios.
