Given the two pieces of information, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The population distribution of males and females in the city. According to the first piece of information, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The reliability of the witness in identifying gender. According to the second piece of information, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, there's an important difference between these two pieces of information. The first piece of information refers to the city's population as a whole, while the second piece of information refers to the witness's ability to identify gender in specific situations.

The witness's statement that the attacker is male does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually male in the true population sense. It could be a false positive error made by the witness.

Given that we don't have any information about the reliability of the witness's statement in this specific situation, it's not possible to provide a precise probability estimate. Therefore, I must answer the question as follows:

{probability: Unable to provide a number, as there is not enough information}
