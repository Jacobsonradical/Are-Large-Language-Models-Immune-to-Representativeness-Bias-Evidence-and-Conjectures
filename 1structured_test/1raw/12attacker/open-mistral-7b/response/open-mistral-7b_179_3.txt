To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the city's gender distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The city's gender distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy in gender identification: 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

A) The attacker is actually male, and the witness correctly identified the gender.
B) The attacker is female, and the witness made an error in identifying the gender.

Let's calculate the probabilities for each scenario:

A) The probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies the gender is the probability that the attacker is male (15%) multiplied by the witness's accuracy in identifying males (80%):
   P(A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%

B) The probability that the attacker is female and the witness incorrectly identifies the gender is the probability that the attacker is female (85%) multiplied by the witness's error rate in identifying females (20%):
   P(B) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%

Since we know that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can't consider the probability of the attacker being female and the witness correctly identifying the gender. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probabilities of the attacker being male and the witness making an error and the attacker being male and the witness correctly identifying the gender:

P(attacker is male | witness's identification) = P(A) + P(B)

P(attacker is male | witness's identification) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

So, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 29%.
