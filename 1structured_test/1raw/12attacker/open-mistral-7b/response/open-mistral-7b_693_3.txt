To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since the attacker's gender is unknown, we can assume that there is a 50-50 chance that the attacker is male or female.

Given this 50-50 chance, and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender 80% of the time, we can calculate the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male.

The probability of a correct identification (male) is the witness's success rate times the true probability of the event being male:

P(male) = Witness success rate * True probability of male
        = 0.8 * 0.5
        = 0.4

Since the witness also has a 20% chance of erring and identifying the attacker as male when they are actually female, we need to add this to our calculation:

P(male) = 0.4 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.5)
        = 0.4 + 0.2 * 0.5
        = 0.4 + 0.1
        = 0.5

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.5 or 50%.
