To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, it is more likely that the attacker is actually female. However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness made an error.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is female as P(F) and the probability that the attacker is male as P(M).

Given the population distribution, we have P(F) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15.

The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male with probability 0.2. This means that the probability that the attacker is actually female and the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male is 0.2 * P(F).

On the other hand, the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identified him as such is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually female is P(F) = 0.2 / (0.2 * P(F) + 0.12).

Solving this equation, we get P(F) ≈ 0.46 (rounded to four decimal places).

Since P(M) + P(F) = 1, we can find P(M) = 1 - P(F) ≈ 0.54.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.54}.
