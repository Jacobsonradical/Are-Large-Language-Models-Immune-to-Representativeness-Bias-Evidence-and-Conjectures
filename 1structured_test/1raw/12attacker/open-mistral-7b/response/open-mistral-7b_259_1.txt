To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as M and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as F.

From the information provided, we know that M + F = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy) and F = 0.2 (the witness's error rate). Solving these two equations, we get M = 0.6.

Now, let's consider the city's gender distribution. Since 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the probability of a random person being male as P(male) = 0.15.

Given this information, we can now estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identified a male.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is M = 0.6.

Therefore, {probability: 0.6}
