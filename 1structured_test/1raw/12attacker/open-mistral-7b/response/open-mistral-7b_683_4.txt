To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This is our prior probability, which is based on demographic data.

2. The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying gender 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time.

3. However, the witness's error rate is not specific to misidentifying males as females or females as males. To account for this, we can assume that the error rate is equally distributed between both genders (since the witness's overall error rate is 20%). This means the witness misidentifies males as females 10% of the time and females as males 10% of the time.

4. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:
   a) The attacker is actually male, and the witness correctly identified him. This happens 80% of the time when the witness identifies a male.
   b) The attacker is actually female, and the witness mistakenly identifies her as male. This happens 10% of the time when the witness identifies a female.

5. To calculate the probability of scenario a, we multiply the prior probability of the attacker being male by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

6. To calculate the probability of scenario b, we multiply the prior probability of the attacker being female by the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female: 0.85 * 0.1 = 0.085

7. Since only one of these scenarios can be true, we add their probabilities to find the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male: 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.205, or 20.5%.
