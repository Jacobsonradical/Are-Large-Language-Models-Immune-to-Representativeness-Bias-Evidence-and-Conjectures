Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.

Let's denote the true gender of the attacker as F for female and M for male. The probability of the witness identifying a female as male (Type I error) is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03, and the probability of the witness identifying a male as male (correct identification) is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

The probability of the witness identifying a female as female (correct identification) is 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68.

Now, since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male (given the witness's statement) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness making a correct identification and the probabilities of the witness making a Type I error, given that the attacker is male:

P(M | witness statement) = P(M and correct identification) + P(M and Type I error)
                                      = 0.12 + 0.03
                                      = 0.15

However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness made a Type II error (mistakenly identifying a female as male). The probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

So, the probability of the witness making a correct identification, given that the attacker is female, is P(M | witness statement) + P(F | witness statement) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male, given both the population distribution and the witness's statement, by multiplying the prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15) by the likelihood of the witness's statement, given that the attacker is male (0.15), and dividing it by the total likelihood of the witness's statement:

P(M | all information) = (0.15 * 0.15) / (0.15 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)
                                     â‰ˆ 0.115

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.115 or 11.5%.
