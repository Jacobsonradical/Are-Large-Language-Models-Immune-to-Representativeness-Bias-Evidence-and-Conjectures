To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, since we don't know the actual gender of the attacker, we can't use the witness's accuracy directly. Instead, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which helps calculate probabilities in situations like this.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of event B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of event B. In this case, A is the attacker being male and B is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male and P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female. Since we know that 85% of the population is female, we can calculate P(F) as 0.85. Therefore, P(M) = 1 - P(F) = 0.15.

Let P(BM) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, and P(BF) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female.

From the given information, we know that P(BM) = 0.8 and P(BF) = 0.2.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(M|BM) = [P(BM) * P(M)] / [P(BM) * P(M) + P(BF) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|BM) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / 0.182 = 0.6575

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.66 or 66%.
