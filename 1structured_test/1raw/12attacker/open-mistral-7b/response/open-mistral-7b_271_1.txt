Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, a witness identified the attacker as male.
3. We also know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given this information, we can't directly calculate the probability that the attacker is male based on the city's population distribution because the witness's error rate is affecting the identification.

But if we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual gender distribution in the population, we can use the Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness's Identification) = P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male) / [P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male) + P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Female) * P(Attacker is Female)]

However, we don't have P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Female) in the information provided. So, without this value, we can't calculate a strict probability.

But if we approximate P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Female) to be the same as P(Witness's Identification | Attacker is Male) = 0.8 (given that the witness's error rate is the same for both genders), we can simplify the equation:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness's Identification) â‰ˆ 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85)

This approximation gives us a probability of approximately 0.16, or 16%.

But remember, this is an approximation based on the assumption that the witness's error rate is the same for both genders, and without more information, we can't calculate the probability with certainty.
