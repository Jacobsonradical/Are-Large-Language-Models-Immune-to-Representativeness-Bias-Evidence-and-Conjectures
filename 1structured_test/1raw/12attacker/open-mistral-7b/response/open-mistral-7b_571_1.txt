To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the error was in identifying a male as female or vice versa, we can assume that the error rate is equally distributed between both genders.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the expected number of males in a random sample of people is 0.15 * number_of_people.

Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the expected number of correctly identified males in a random sample is 0.8 * 0.15 * number_of_people = 0.12 * number_of_people.

The witness mistakenly identifies males as females 20% of the time, which means that in a random sample of people, the expected number of false positives is 0.2 * 0.15 * number_of_people = 0.03 * number_of_people.

The total number of males in the sample is therefore (0.12 * number_of_people) + (0.03 * number_of_people) = 0.15 * number_of_people.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is the ratio of the number of males in the sample to the total number of people in the sample, which is equal to the ratio of correctly identified males to the total number of people in the sample.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 * number_of_people / (0.12 * number_of_people + 0.03 * number_of_people) = 0.833, which is approximately 83.3%.
