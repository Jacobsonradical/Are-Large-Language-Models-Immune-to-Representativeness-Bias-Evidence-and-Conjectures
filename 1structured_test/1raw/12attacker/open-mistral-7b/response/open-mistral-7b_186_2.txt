Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.
2. However, we also have information about the witness's ability to correctly identify gender. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male. If the witness was correct, then the attacker is indeed male. If the witness was wrong, then the attacker is female, despite the witness's identification.
4. Since we don't know if the witness was correct or not, we need to consider both possibilities. If the witness was correct, the probability that the attacker is male is 100%. If the witness was wrong, the probability that the attacker is male is 0%.
5. Given that the witness was correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time, the probability that the witness was correct in this case is 0.8 (or 80%).
6. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (or 80%).
