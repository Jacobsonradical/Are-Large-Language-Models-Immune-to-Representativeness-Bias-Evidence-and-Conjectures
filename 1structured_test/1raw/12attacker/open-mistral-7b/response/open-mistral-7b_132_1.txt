The given information suggests that in the general population, 15% of people are male. However, we also have information about the witness's ability to correctly identify gender. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, the attacker could either be female (a false positive) or actually male (the correct identification). Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, it means that 20% of the time when the witness identifies someone as male, they are actually identifying a female.

Since we know that 85% of the population is female, and the witness errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability that the witness's identification of a female as male is a false positive.

Let F be the probability of the attacker being female, and T be the probability of the attacker being male. We know that F = 0.85 and T = 0.15.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is F * 0.20 (the 0.20 represents the 20% error rate of the witness).

Since the witness did incorrectly identify the attacker as male, we can write an equation: F * 0.20 = 0.15 (the 0.15 represents the actual probability of the attacker being male).

Solving for F, we get F = 0.3 (30%).

However, we are asked to estimate the probability that the attacker is male, which is T.

T = 0.15 (given by the population statistics)

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15.
