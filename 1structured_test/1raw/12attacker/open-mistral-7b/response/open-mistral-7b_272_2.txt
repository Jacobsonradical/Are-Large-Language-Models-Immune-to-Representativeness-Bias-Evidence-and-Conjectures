Given the information provided, we have two sources of information about the attacker's gender: the general population demographics and the witness's assessment.

The population demographics suggest that the attacker is more likely to be female, given that 85% of the city's population is female. However, the witness reported that the attacker appeared to be male.

The witness's ability to judge gender accuracy is 80%, meaning they incorrectly identify gender in 20% of cases. Therefore, even if the witness's assessment is incorrect, there's a 20% chance that they actually saw a male attacker.

Since we cannot discount the possibility of the witness's assessment being correct due to their high accuracy rate, it seems reasonable to consider both pieces of information.

Therefore, the probability estimate would be a weighted average of the two probabilities, taking into account the reliability of each source of information. If we assign a weight of 0.7 to the population demographics (since it's based on the general population) and a weight of 0.3 to the witness's assessment (since it's based on a single observation), we can calculate the estimated probability as follows:

0.7 * 0.15 (probability of a male attacker in the population) + 0.3 * 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, given they saw one)

This calculation results in an estimated probability of 0.24 or 24%. Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 24%.
