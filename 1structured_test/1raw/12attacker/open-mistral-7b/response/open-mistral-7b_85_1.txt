Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's assume that the attacker's gender is unknown and is equally likely to be male or female (50% chance each). If the witness makes a mistake, they are more likely to mistake a male for a female than the other way around, given the gender distribution in the city.

So, when the witness identifies the attacker as male, there are two possibilities:

- The attacker is indeed male (true positive), or
- The witness made a mistake and identified a female as male (false positive).

The probability of a false positive can be calculated as the probability of a mistake times the probability of the attacker being female:

False Positive Probability = 0.2 (witness error rate) * 0.15 (probability of attacker being female)

Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability of a true positive is:

True Positive Probability = 0.8 (witness accuracy) * 0.15 (probability of attacker being male)

The probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification can be calculated as the ratio of true positives to the total number of positive identifications (true positives + false positives):

P(Attacker is Male | Witness's Identification) = True Positive Probability / (True Positive Probability + False Positive Probability)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness's Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.15))

The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.38, or 38%.
