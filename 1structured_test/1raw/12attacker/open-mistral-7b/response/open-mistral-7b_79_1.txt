Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender and a 20% error rate.
2. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (15% female population times 20% error rate).

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male attacker as female is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (15% male population times 20% error rate).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification. This is a conditional probability problem, which can be calculated as the probability of the witness's identification given the attacker is male, divided by the total probability of the witness's identification.

The probability of the witness's identification given the attacker is male is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
The total probability of the witness's identification is 0.8 (probability of correct male identification) + 0.03 (probability of incorrect female identification as male) + 0.03 (probability of incorrect male identification as female) = 0.86 (80% correct male + 3% incorrect female + 3% incorrect male).

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 / 0.86 = 0.931 (approximately 93.1%).
