Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's gender is 80% (with an error rate of 20%).
2. The population composition in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being male, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the event A (attacker being male)
- P(B) is the probability of the evidence B (witness identifying a male attacker)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the evidence given the event (the probability the witness correctly identifies a male)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (80%), P(A) = ? (prior probability), and P(B) = [P(A) * 0.8] + [P(not A) * 0.2] (since the witness can only identify one gender, and there are only two genders, the probability of the evidence B is the sum of the probabilities of the event A and the complementary event 'not A' multiplied by their respective error rates).

We are also given P(B) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female, and the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time, the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker is 0.85).

Now, we can solve for P(A) using the equation:

P(A) = [P(B) * P(A)] / P(B)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A) = (0.8 * P(A)) / 0.85

Solving for P(A), we get:

P(A) â‰ˆ 0.947 or 94.7%

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 94.7%.
