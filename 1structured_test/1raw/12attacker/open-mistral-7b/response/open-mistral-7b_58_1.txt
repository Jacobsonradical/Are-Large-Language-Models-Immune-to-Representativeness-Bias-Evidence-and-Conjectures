Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80% and they make errors 20% of the time. However, we don't have specific information about how many times the witness made an error in this particular situation. Since we can't assume that the witness was incorrect in this instance, we should consider the worst-case scenario for the attacker being female.

In that scenario, the witness would be correct 80% of the time, and the attacker is actually female. Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of the attacker being female in this worst-case scenario is 0.85.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male 20% of the time, and we're assuming that this was one of those instances, the probability of the attacker being male in this worst-case scenario is 0.20.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's incorrect identification, is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
