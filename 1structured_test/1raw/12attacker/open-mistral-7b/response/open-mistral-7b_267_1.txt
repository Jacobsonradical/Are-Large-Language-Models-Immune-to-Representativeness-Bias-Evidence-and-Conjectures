Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80% (or 0.8), and they err 20% of the time (or 0.2). The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

The witness identified the attacker as male, so we can assume they made a correct identification or an error. Given that the witness's error rate is 20%, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the probability of a correct identification, which is the witness's success rate of 80%.

However, since we don't know if the witness made a correct identification or an error, we need to consider both possibilities and their respective probabilities. Let's call the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification P(M|W).

If the witness made a correct identification, then P(M|W) = 0.8 (the probability of a correct identification). If the witness made an error, then P(M|W) = 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being male in the general population).

The probability of the witness making a correct identification is P(W|M) = 0.8. The probability of the witness making an error is P(W|~M) = 0.2 (where ~M denotes not male).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write the probability of the attacker being male as:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)

Using the given population ratios, P(M) = 0.15 and P(~M) = 0.85.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.29 or 29%. However, this estimation assumes that the witness's identification is accurate, which is not given in the information provided. Since we cannot determine whether the witness made a correct identification or an error, the actual probability of the attacker being male remains uncertain.
