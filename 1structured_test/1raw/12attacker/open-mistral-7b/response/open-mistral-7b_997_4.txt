To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's reliability: In a sample of people, half female and half male, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errores in 20% of the cases.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

a) The attacker is actually male, and the witness correctly identified the gender.
b) The attacker is female, and the witness mistakenly identified the gender.

The probability of scenario a is the probability that the attacker is male in the population (15%) multiplied by the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker (0.8).

The probability of scenario b is the probability that the attacker is female in the population (15%) multiplied by the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female attacker as male (0.2).

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is:

P(attacker is male | witness's ID) = P(attacker is male) * P(witness correctly identifies male) + P(attacker is female) * P(witness mistakenly identifies female as male)
= 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2
= 0.12 + 0.03
= 0.15

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 or 15%.
