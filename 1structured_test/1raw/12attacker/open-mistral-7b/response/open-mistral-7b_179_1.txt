To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender.

1. The general population distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's error rate is equally distributed between identifying males and females as incorrect.

Given this information, it's not possible to provide a precise probability estimate. The witness's error rate is not specified for males or females, which is crucial for making an accurate estimation. It would be necessary to have more information about the witness's error rate for each gender to make a more informed estimate.

So, based on the information provided, I cannot provide a probability estimate within the required format: {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
