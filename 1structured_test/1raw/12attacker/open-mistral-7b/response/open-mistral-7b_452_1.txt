To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the gender distribution in the city is equally likely (50% male and 50% female), then we can calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is male as follows:

Probability of witness error given male attacker = Probability of witness error = 0.2

Similarly, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is female as follows:

Probability of witness error given female attacker = Probability of witness identifying male = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1

Now we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male:

Probability of witness identifying male given male attacker = 1 - Probability of witness error given male attacker = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Similarly, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female:

Probability of witness identifying male given female attacker = Probability of witness error given female attacker = 0.1

Since we don't have any additional information about the actual gender of the attacker, we need to consider both possibilities. The probability of the attacker being male is the weighted sum of these two probabilities:

Probability of attacker being male = (Probability of witness identifying male given male attacker * Probability of male attacker) + (Probability of witness identifying male given female attacker * Probability of female attacker)

We know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, so the probability of a male attacker is 0.15. Plugging in the values:

Probability of attacker being male = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.084 = 0.204

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.204 or 20.4%.
