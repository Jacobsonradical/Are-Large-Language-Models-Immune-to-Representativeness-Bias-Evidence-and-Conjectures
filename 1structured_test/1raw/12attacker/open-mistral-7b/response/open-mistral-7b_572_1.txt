Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male based on the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city.

First, let's calculate the expected number of males in the city based on the population distribution:

Expected number of males = Total population * Proportion of males
                                     = 100 * 0.15
                                     = 15

Now, let's consider the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the error rate is 20%. Therefore, the probability of an error for a male is:

Error probability for male = 0.20

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that this was an error is Error probability for male. The probability that the attacker is truly male is therefore:

Probability of attacker being male = 1 - Error probability for male
                                                    = 1 - 0.20
                                                    = 0.80

So, based on the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.80 or 80%.
