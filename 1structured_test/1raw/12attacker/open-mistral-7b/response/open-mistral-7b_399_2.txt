To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The gender distribution in the city: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Given these facts, let's calculate the probability:

If the attacker is indeed male, the witness will correctly identify the gender 80% of the time. So, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male if the attacker is male is 0.8.

On the other hand, if the attacker is female, the witness will err 20% of the time. So, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male if the attacker is female is 0.2.

Since the probability of any event and its complement are additive, the probability that the attacker is female given that the witness identified the attacker as male is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, we know that the attacker is either male or female, and the probability of each is given. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male:

P(Attacker is male | Witnessed gender is male) = [P(Witnessed gender is male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male)] / [P(Witnessed gender is male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witnessed gender is male | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female)]

Substituting the given probabilities:

P(Attacker is male | Witnessed gender is male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating the probability:

P(Attacker is male | Witnessed gender is male) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4137 or 41.37%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 41.37%.
