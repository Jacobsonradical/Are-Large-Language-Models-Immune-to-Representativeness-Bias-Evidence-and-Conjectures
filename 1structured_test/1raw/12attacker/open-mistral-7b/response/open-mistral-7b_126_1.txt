Given the two pieces of information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The population demographics of the city, which we know to be 85% female and 15% male.
2. The reliability of the witness's gender identification, which is 80% accurate and 20% inaccurate.

However, there's an issue with the information from the witness. The witness identified the attacker as male, but we don't know if this identification was correct or not. Without this information, we can't directly use the witness's accuracy rate to make an estimate about the attacker's gender.

Therefore, based on the population demographics alone, the most logical estimate would be to assume that the attacker is female, given that the majority of the population is female. But without more information, we can't provide a strict probability estimate.

{probability: Unable to provide a number, as the witness's identification accuracy is not known.}
