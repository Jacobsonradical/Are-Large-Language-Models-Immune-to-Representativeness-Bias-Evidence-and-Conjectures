Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% (with an error rate of 20%).
2. The population composition is 85% female and 15% male.

However, we need to account for the fact that the witness made an error in this case. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, it means that the witness made an error in 20% of the cases when the actual attacker was a female.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's error, is the error rate multiplied by the probability that the attacker is female:

{probability: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, probability is approximately 17%}

Therefore, based on the witness's identification and the city's population composition, it is estimated that the attacker is male with a probability of approximately 17%.
