Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge.

Let's denote:
- A: The attacker is male
- ¬A: The attacker is not male (female)
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as male

From the information given, we know P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness is 80% accurate in identifying males)
P(E|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness is 80% accurate in identifying females, so 20% of the time they err and identify a female as male)
P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (the population is 85% female)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute P(A|E):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(A|E) ≈ 0.16

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 16%.
