Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis.

In this case, H is the attacker being male, and E is the witness's identification of a male attacker. Let's denote the probability of H as P(M), and the probability of E given H as P(E|M). We also have the prior probability of H, P(H), and the probability of E given not H, P(E|not H).

From the information given, we have:
1. P(E|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified male 80% of the time)
2. P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified male 20% of the time)
3. P(M) = the probability we want to find (the probability that the attacker is male)
4. P(not H) = 1 - P(M) (the probability that the attacker is female)

The prior probability of a male attacker, P(M), is not given in the information. However, we are given that 85% of the population is female, so 15% is male. This means that P(not H) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|E) = P(E|M) * P(M) / [P(E|M) * P(M) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

Plugging in the values we have, we get:

P(M|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us:

P(M|E) â‰ˆ 0.28

So, given the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 28%.
