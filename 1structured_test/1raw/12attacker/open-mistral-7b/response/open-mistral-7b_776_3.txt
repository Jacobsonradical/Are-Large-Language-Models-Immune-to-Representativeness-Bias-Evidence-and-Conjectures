Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate the probabilities required:

1. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, given that the attacker is indeed male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

2. P(H|E) is what we're trying to find. This is the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

3. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male. Since 15% of the city's population is male, this probability is 0.15.

4. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time when the person is male, and errs 20% of the time when the person is female, we can calculate P(E) as follows:
   P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
   P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
