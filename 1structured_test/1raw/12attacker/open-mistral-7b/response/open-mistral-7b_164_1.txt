To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means that for every 100 people they see, they correctly identify 80 as the gender they actually are, and mistakenly identify 20 as the opposite gender.

Given that 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male, the number of females in the city is 0.85 * 100 = 85, and the number of males is 0.15 * 100 = 15.

If the witness sees a person from the city, they have a 0.85 chance of seeing a female and a 0.15 chance of seeing a male. Since they correctly identify gender 80% of the time, they will correctly identify a female 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68 or 68% of the time. They will also incorrectly identify a female as male 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17% of the time. Since they correctly identify males 80% of the time, they will correctly identify a male 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12% of the time. They will also incorrectly identify a male as female 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 or 3% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, they must have incorrectly identified a female as male. The probability of this happening is 0.17, which means that there is a 0.17 chance that the attacker is actually female.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 or 83%.
