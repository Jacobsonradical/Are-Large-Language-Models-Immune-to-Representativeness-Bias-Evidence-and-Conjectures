To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's gender identification.

Let's denote:

- A as the event that the attacker is male, and its prior probability is P(A).
- ¬A as the event that the attacker is female, and its prior probability is P(¬A) = 1 - P(A).
- E as the event that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender. Its probability is given by the witness's accuracy: P(E|A) = 0.8, and P(E|¬A) = 0.2.

Since the witness's gender identification is the only piece of information we have, we are interested in P(A|E).

According to Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Given that 85% of the population is female, we can estimate P(¬A) = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15.

Now we can calculate P(A|E):

P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

P(A|E) ≈ 0.16

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 16%.
