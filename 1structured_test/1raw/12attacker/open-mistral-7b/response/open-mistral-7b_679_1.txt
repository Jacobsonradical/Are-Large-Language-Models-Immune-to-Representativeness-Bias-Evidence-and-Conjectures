Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time.
2. The city has a 85% female population and a 15% male population.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct gender identification given that the attacker is male, and then multiply that probability by the actual probability of the attacker being male.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.80 (from the witness's accuracy).
The probability of the attacker being male is the ratio of male individuals in the city to the total population.

The total population is the sum of the male and female populations, which is 1 * 0.15 (male) + 1 * 0.85 (female) = 1.
So, the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

The probability of both events happening (witness correctly identifies a male attacker and the attacker is indeed male) is the product of the two probabilities: 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.12} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.
