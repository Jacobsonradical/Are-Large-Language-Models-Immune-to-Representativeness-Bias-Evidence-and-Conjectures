To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have specific information about the gender of the victim, let's assume an equal chance of the attacker being male or female.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of choosing a female person at random is 0.85.

If the witness's identification is reliable, we would expect them to correctly identify a male attacker 80% of the time. However, since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we need to account for this error rate as well.

If the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male, the actual attacker is still female. This means that the actual attacker is female 20% of the time when the witness identifies the attacker as male.

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is:

0.8 (probability of the witness's correct identification) + 0.2 (probability of the witness's incorrect identification when the actual attacker is female) * 0 (the actual attacker is not male in this case)
= 0.8 + 0 * 0
= 0.8

However, we cannot ignore the gender distribution in the city. Since 85% of the population is female, and the witness's identification might be biased towards the majority, the actual probability of the attacker being male is likely lower than 0.8.

Therefore, as a rough estimate, we can say that the probability that the attacker is male is less than 0.8, but without more specific information, we cannot provide a more precise number.

{probability: less than 0.8, please note this is an estimate based on the given information and likely an underestimate due to potential gender bias in the witness's identification.}
