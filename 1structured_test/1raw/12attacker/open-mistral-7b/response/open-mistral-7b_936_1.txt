Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and mistakenly identifies gender 20% of the time. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Since the witness couldn't see the attacker's gender clearly, we can use the witness's error rate as an estimate of the probability that the witness would misidentify the attacker's gender, given that the attacker is actually female. In this case, the error rate is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is equal to 1 minus the probability that the attacker is female, given the witness's error rate.

So, the probability that the attacker is male = 1 - (probability that the attacker is female given the witness's error rate)

= 1 - (0.85 * (1 - 0.20))

= 1 - 0.68

= 0.32

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.32.
