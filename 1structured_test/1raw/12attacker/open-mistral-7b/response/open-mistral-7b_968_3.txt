To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of a false positive (mistakenly identifying a female as male) as follows:

1. The probability of a false positive is the error rate (20%) multiplied by the proportion of females in the population (0.85).

False Positive Probability = Error Rate * Proportion of Females
                                          = 0.2 * 0.85
                                          = 0.17

Now, we can calculate the probability of a true positive (correctly identifying a male) by subtracting the false positive probability from 1:

True Positive Probability = 1 - False Positive Probability
                                          = 1 - 0.17
                                          = 0.83

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the event we're interested in is a true positive. So, the probability that the attacker is male is the true positive probability:

{probability: 0.83}
