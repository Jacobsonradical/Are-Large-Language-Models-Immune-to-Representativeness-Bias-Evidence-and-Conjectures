Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this formula:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male),
- E is the evidence (witness's identification and gender distribution in the city),
- P(H|E) is the probability we are trying to estimate (probability that the attacker is male given the evidence),
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender 80% of the time when the attacker is male),
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being male before considering the evidence),
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (without considering the hypothesis).

First, let's calculate P(E|H). According to the information provided, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time when the attacker is male. So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(H). Since we don't have any prior information about the attacker's gender, we can assume that there's no reason to favor one gender over the other before considering the evidence. So, we can assume that P(H) = P(not H) = 0.5 (since the total probability of all outcomes must add up to 1).

Now, we need to calculate P(E). Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of the witness seeing a female person is 0.85. So, P(E) = P(not E|not H) * P(not H) + P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.15 * 0.5 + 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.6.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.4

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the evidence is approximately 0.4 or 40%.
