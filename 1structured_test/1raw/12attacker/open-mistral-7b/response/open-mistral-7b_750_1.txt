Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The population distribution of the city, which is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender, which is 80% accurate. However, the witness also makes errors 20% of the time.

The witness's statement that the attacker is male contradicts the population distribution, as it suggests a higher than expected proportion of male attackers. The witness's accuracy rate of 80% does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually male, since errors can occur.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability based on new evidence. The formula is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

The probability of the witness making a mistake (P(B|not A)) is 20%. Since the probability of the witness making a correct identification (P(B|A)) is 80%, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male (P(A)) as follows:

P(A) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8, P(not A) = 0.15, and P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this, we find that P(A) â‰ˆ 0.169, or approximately 16.9%.

Therefore, given the information provided, it is estimated that the attacker is male with a probability of approximately 16.9%. This estimate takes into account both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy rate. However, it's important to note that this is a probability estimate and it does not mean that the attacker is definitely male or female.
