To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't have information about whether the witness's errors are more likely to be misidentifying males as females or vice versa. Let's assume for now that the errors are evenly distributed.

The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. If the errors are evenly distributed, we can consider that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 10% of the time (since the error rate is 20% and there are more females in the population).

Given this, when the witness identifies someone as male, there are two possibilities:
1. The person is actually male (true positive).
2. The witness has mistakenly identified a female as male (false positive).

The probability of a true positive is the probability of a male in the population times the witness's accuracy in identifying males.
P(true positive) = P(male) * P(correctly identifies male)
= 0.15 * 0.8
= 0.12

The probability of a false positive is the probability of a female in the population times the witness's error rate in identifying females as males.
P(false positive) = P(female) * P(incorrectly identifies female as male)
= 0.85 * 0.10
= 0.085

The total number of times the witness identifies someone as male is the sum of true positives and false positives.
P(identified as male) = P(true positive) + P(false positive)
= 0.12 + 0.085
= 0.205

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can use the probability of being identified as male to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.
P(attacker is male) = P(identified as male) / P(true positive)
= 0.205 / 0.12
= 0.675

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.675 (67.5%). It's important to note that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions, and the actual probability could be different.
