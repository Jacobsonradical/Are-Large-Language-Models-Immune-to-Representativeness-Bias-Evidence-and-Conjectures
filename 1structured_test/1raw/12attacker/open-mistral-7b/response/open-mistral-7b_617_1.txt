To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory, used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: The evidence: the witness identified the attacker as male

The probability of H (P(H)) is what we want to estimate, while P(E|H) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male (given that the attacker is male), and P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male (given that the attacker is not male).

From the information provided, we have:

- P(H) = probability that the attacker is male (unknown)
- P(~H) = probability that the attacker is female (1 - P(H))
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge gender)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (from the witness's ability to judge gender)

The total probability of the evidence (P(E)) is the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

We can rearrange this equation to solve for P(H) (the probability that the attacker is male):

P(H) = (P(E) - P(E|~H) * P(~H)) / P(E|H)

Now we need the total probability of the evidence P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Since we don't know P(H), we can replace it with the known city population gender distribution:

P(H) ≈ P(Male in population) = 0.15 (from information b)

P(~H) ≈ P(Female in population) = 0.85 (from information b)

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) ≈ 0.8 (from information a) * 0.15 + 0.2 (from information a) * 0.85 = 0.16 + 0.17 = 0.33

Now we can calculate P(H):

P(H) ≈ (0.33 - 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8 = 0.13 / 0.8 ≈ 0.1625

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.1625 or 16.25%.
