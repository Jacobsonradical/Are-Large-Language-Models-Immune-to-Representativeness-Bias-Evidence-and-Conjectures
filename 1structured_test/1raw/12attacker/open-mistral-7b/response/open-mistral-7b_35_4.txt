To estimate the probability of the attacker being male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's assume the attacker's gender is either "M" (male) or "F" (female).

1. From the witness's statement, we know that they incorrectly identify a person's gender 20% of the time. This means they correctly identify a person's gender 80% of the time.

2. The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male.

3. We can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male (P(M|witness_male)) using the Bayes' theorem:

   P(M|witness_male) = P(witness_male|M) * P(M) / [P(witness_male|M) * P(M) + P(witness_male|F) * P(F)]

   P(witness_male|M) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

   P(M) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is the city's male population proportion, 0.15.

   P(witness_male|F) is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male. Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, this probability is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

   P(F) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is the city's female population proportion, 0.85.

   Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem, we get:

   P(M|witness_male) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85] = 0.125 / 0.149 = 0.833

So, based on the witness's statement and the city's gender distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.833 or 83.3%.
