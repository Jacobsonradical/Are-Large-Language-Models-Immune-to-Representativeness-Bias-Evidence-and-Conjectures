To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is actually male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is P(male) * (1 - 0.8) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that the actual attacker is either male or the witness made an error. The probability of the witness making an error is 0.03, and the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness correctly identified him is 0.15. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(male | witnessed as male) = 0.03 + 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.16 + 0.12 = 0.28

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is approximately 0.28 or 28%.
