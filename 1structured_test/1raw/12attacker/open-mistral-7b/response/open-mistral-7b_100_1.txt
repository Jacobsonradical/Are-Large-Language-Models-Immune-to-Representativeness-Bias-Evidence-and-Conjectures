Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. A witness who is 80% accurate would incorrectly identify a female as male only 20% of the time. Since we know that 85% of the population is female, this means that 15% of the population is male.

So, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 15% * 20% = 0.03 or 3%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, and the probability of the witness making a mistake in this case is 3%, the probability that the attacker is actually male is 1 - 0.03 = {probability: 0.97, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
