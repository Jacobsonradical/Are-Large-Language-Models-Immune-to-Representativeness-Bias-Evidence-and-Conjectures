To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's gender is randomly distributed in the city (which is not necessarily the case, but we'll use this assumption for simplicity), then the probability of the witness erring in identifying the attacker as male or female would be 20%.

However, we know that 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male. The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time. Since there are more females, most of the times when the witness errs, they are identifying a female as male.

Therefore, the probability that the witness's error is due to the attacker being male is more likely to be when the attacker is actually female and the witness mistakes her for male. In this case, the probability of the attacker being male would be the probability of the witness erring times the probability of the attacker being female.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is (0.20) * (0.15) = 0.03, or 3%.

However, we must also consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender. Since the attacker was attacked from behind, the witness's accuracy might not apply perfectly to this situation. We don't have enough information to adjust the 80% accuracy rate for this specific scenario, so we should consider the 80% as an upper limit.

Therefore, despite the witness's identification, the most conservative estimate would be the actual gender distribution in the city, which is 15% or 0.15.

In summary, the probability that the attacker is male based on the witness's identification is a conservative estimate of 0.15, or 15%. However, with the consideration of the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the scenario, a more realistic estimate would be around 3%, but with a large degree of uncertainty.
