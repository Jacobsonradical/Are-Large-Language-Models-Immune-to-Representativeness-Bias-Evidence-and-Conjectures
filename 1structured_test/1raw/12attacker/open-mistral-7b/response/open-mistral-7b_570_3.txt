Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is not perfect but has a 80% success rate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E is the evidence, which is the witness's statement that the attacker is male
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, which is the witness's success rate in identifying males (0.8)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the proportion of males in the city (0.15)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which is the sum of the probability of the evidence given each hypothesis (the probability of the witness saying "male" if the attacker is male and the probability of the witness saying "male" if the attacker is female)

Since we're not given any information about the witness's accuracy in identifying females, we can only calculate the probability of the witness saying "male" if the attacker is male. So, we can assume that P(E|not H) = 0 (because the witness never identified a female as male).

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
               = (0.8 * 0.15) / [P(E)]

Since we don't have P(E), we can't calculate the exact probability. However, we can calculate a lower bound for P(E) by assuming that the witness is perfect in identifying males (P(E|H) = 1), and the lower bound for P(E) is then P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) = (1 * 0.15) = 0.15.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is at least:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.15 = 0.8

This means that, given the evidence, the probability that the attacker is male is at least 80%. However, if the witness's accuracy in identifying males is less than 80%, then the probability that the attacker is male will be less than 80%. We cannot calculate an exact probability without more information.

{probability: 0.8, note: This is a lower bound, and the actual probability may be less.}
