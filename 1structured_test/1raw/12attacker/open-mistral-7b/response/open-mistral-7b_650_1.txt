To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event is that the attacker is male, and the new evidence is the witness's identification. Let's denote:

- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male
- P(w) as the probability that the witness makes the identification

We are given that P(w|M) = 0.8 and P(w|F) = 0.2, and we want to find P(M). We are also given that the population is 85% female and 15% male. However, we don't have direct information about P(w), so we'll have to assume it's the same for all genders.

Since the witness is equally good at identifying males and females, we can assume that P(w) is equal to the sum of P(w|M) and P(w|F), which is 0.8 + 0.2 = 1. This means that the witness always makes an identification.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(M):

P(M) = P(w|M) * P(M) / P(w)

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(M) = 0.8 * P(M) / 1

Dividing both sides by 0.8, we get:

P(M) = P(M)

This means that Bayes' theorem does not give us any new information in this case. The probability of the attacker being male is the same as it was before the witness's testimony.

However, we can still make an estimate based on the population statistics. Since 15% of the population is male, a reasonable estimate for P(M) would be 0.15.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.15}
