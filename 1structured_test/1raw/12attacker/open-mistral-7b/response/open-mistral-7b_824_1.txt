Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's gender and a 20% chance of making an error. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there is a probability of 0.8 (80%) that the witness was correct and the attacker is indeed male. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness was incorrect and the attacker is actually female.

The population is 85% female and 15% male. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.2 (20%). The number of females in the population is 85, so the number of times the witness would incorrectly identify a female as male is 0.2 * 85 = 17.

Given that there are 15% males in the population, the number of males is 15. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is also 0.2 (20%), so the number of times the witness would incorrectly identify a male as female is 0.2 * 15 = 3.

Therefore, the total number of times the witness would incorrectly identify the gender of an attacker is 17 + 3 = 20. The probability of the witness's identification being incorrect is therefore 20/100 = 0.2 (20%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually female and the witness made an error is 0.2 (20%). However, we don't have enough information to calculate the exact probability of this happening, so we can't include it in our estimate.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (80%), assuming the witness's identification was correct. If we were to include the possibility of the witness's error, our estimate would be lower, but we don't have enough information to calculate this exactly.
