To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis given some evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is typically written as:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in identifying males)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the proportion of males in the population)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (independent of the hypothesis)

Given the information provided, we have:

- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)

We don't have explicit information for P(E), but we can derive it from the provided information and P(H|E) and P(H):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

Given that the witness is wrong 20% of the time and the population is 85% female, we can calculate P(E|not H) and P(not H):

- P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies males 20% of the time)
- P(not H) = 0.85 (the proportion of females in the population)

Now, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.4828

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
