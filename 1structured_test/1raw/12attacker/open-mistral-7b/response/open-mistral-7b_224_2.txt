To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's gender identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (witness's gender identification)
- ~H is the complementary hypothesis (attacker is female)

From the provided information, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies male 20% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (population is 15% male)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (population is 85% female)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the result, we find:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.252

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's gender identification, is approximately 25.2%.
