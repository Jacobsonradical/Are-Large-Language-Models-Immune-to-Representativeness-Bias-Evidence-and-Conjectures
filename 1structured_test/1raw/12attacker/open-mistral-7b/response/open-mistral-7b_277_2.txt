To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event given new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being male, and the new evidence is the witness's gender identification.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male
- P(w) as the overall probability that the witness correctly identifies the gender

We are given that P(w|M) = 0.8 and P(w|F) = 0.2, and P(w) = P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F).

Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can estimate P(M) = 0.15 and P(F) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(w):

P(w) = P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's gender identification:

P(M|w) = [P(w|M) * P(M)] / P(w)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.4138 (or 41.38%).
