To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the gender distribution in the city is relevant to the witness's observation, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, times the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B. In this case, event A is the attacker being male, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(W|M) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker (which is given as 0.8). Let P(W|F) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male (which is given as the complementary probability of P(W|M), or 0.2). Let P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female, which is given as 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female).

According to Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W).

We can rewrite this equation as P(M) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W) = 0.8 * P(M) / 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * P(M) / 0.2 * 0.15

Simplifying, we get P(M) = 0.8 * P(M) / 0.68 + 0.2 * P(M) / 0.03

Solving for P(M), we find that P(M) â‰ˆ 0.22 or 22%.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is around 22%, based on the provided information.
