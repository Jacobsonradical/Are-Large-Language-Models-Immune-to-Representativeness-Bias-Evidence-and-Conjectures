To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a person who is actually female, they mistakenly identify that person as male 20% of the time. On the other hand, when the witness sees a person who is actually male, they correctly identify that person as male 80% of the time.

Since 85% of the population in the city is female, the probability of randomly selecting a female from the population is 0.85. The probability of randomly selecting a male is, therefore, 0.15.

When the witness sees a female, they incorrectly identify that person as male 20% of the time. The probability of this error occurring is, therefore, 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17.

When the witness sees a male, they correctly identify that person as male 80% of the time. The probability of this correct identification is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12.

However, we know that the witness identified the attacker as male. This means that either the attacker is actually male, and the witness correctly identified him, or the attacker is actually female, and the witness made an error.

The probability of the first scenario (attacker is male and witness correctly identifies him) is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12. The probability of the second scenario (attacker is female and witness mistakes her for a male) is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%.
