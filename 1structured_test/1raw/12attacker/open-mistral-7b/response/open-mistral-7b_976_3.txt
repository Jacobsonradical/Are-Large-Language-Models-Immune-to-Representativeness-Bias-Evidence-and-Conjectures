Given the information provided, we have two sources of probability estimates for the attacker being male:

1. Based on the city's population demographics, if we assume that the attacker is randomly selected from the city population, the probability of the attacker being male is 15% (0.15).

2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% (0.8), but this only applies to conditions similar to the night of the attack. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this contributes an additional probability of 0.8.

However, we cannot directly combine these probabilities because they represent different types of probabilities. The first is the probability of the attacker being male in the city population, while the second is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement, we would need more information about the reliability of the witness in this specific situation or under the conditions of the attack. As it stands, we cannot provide a strict probability estimate in the requested format.
