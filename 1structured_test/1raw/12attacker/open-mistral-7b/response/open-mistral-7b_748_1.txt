The information given consists of two parts: the demographic distribution of the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender.

1. The demographic distribution gives us that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.
2. The witness's accuracy is 80% in correctly identifying gender and 20% in error.

However, there's a crucial piece of information missing: we don't know how the witness's error rate applies to their identification of the attacker. If the error rate is independent of the gender of the person they are observing, then we could use the demographic distribution to make an estimate.

But if the error rate is biased towards one gender, we can't rely on the demographic distribution alone. For example, if the witness consistently mistakes females for males, then even if the city is 85% female, the witness might still estimate the attacker as male if they made an error.

Without this additional information, it's not possible to provide a reliable estimate for the probability that the attacker is male. The probability would depend on the specifics of the witness's error rate and how it applies to the case at hand.

Therefore, {probability: cannot be determined with the given information, please provide more details} is the best answer.
