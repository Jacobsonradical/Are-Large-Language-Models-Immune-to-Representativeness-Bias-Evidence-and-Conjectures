To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we should consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can assume that if the victim had seen the attacker clearly, the probability that the attacker is male would be 0.8 (80%). However, the victim could not see the attacker's gender, so we need to take into account the fact that the witness's identification might be incorrect.

The witness misidentified the attacker's gender, and since we know the gender distribution in the city, we can calculate the probability that this misidentification occurred due to the witness mistaking a female for a male instead of the other way around.

Since 85% of the population is female, the probability that a randomly chosen person is female is 0.85. The witness identified the attacker as male, so the probability that this misidentification was due to choosing a female among the 85% is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

On the other hand, the probability that the misidentification was due to choosing a male among the 15% is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

Since the probability of misidentification due to mistaking a female for a male is higher, we can assume that the actual probability that the attacker is male is lower than 0.8.

However, without more specific information, we cannot calculate an exact probability. To provide an estimate, we can assume that the probability of misidentification due to mistaking a female for a male is closer to 17% than to 12%. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the misidentification by the witness, is likely lower than 0.8 but higher than 0.12.
