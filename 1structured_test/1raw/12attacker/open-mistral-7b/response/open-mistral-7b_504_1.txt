Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, the witness made an error in this specific case, identifying the attacker as male. This means the attacker could either be male (correct identification by the witness) or female (error by the witness).

The probability that the witness was incorrect (the attacker is female) is 20%, as stated in the information. Therefore, the probability that the witness was correct (the attacker is male) is 1 - 20% = 0.8 or 80%.

However, the witness's error rate of 20% applies to a situation where the gender distribution is 50% male and 50% female. In this city, the gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male. This means the witness is more likely to make an error when identifying a male, as males are a minority in the city.

To account for this, we can adjust the witness's error rate. If we assume the witness is 25% more likely to make an error when identifying a male (due to their rarity), then the actual error rate would be 20% * 1.25 = 0.25 or 25%.

In this case, the probability that the witness was correct (the attacker is male) would be 80% - 0.25 = 0.75 or 75%.

Therefore, based on the adjusted error rate, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.75 or 75%.
