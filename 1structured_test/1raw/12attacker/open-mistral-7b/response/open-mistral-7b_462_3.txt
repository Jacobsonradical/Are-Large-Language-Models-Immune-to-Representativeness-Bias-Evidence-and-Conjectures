To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

From the information provided, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. However, we don't have enough information to account for the 20% of cases where the witness errs. Without knowing if the errors are more likely to be misidentifying males as females or vice versa, we can't adjust the 80% success rate accordingly.

Given that we don't have enough information to adjust the witness's success rate, we can only use the raw 80% as our best estimate. Now, we need to consider the gender distribution in the city. The city is 85% female and 15% male.

If we assume that the witness's 80% success rate applies equally to both genders (which might not be accurate, but we don't have enough information to make a different assumption), then the probability that the attacker is male is equal to the number of times the witness correctly identifies a male divided by the total number of people.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is (15% of total population) / (0.80 * 85% of total population + 0.20 * 15% of total population) = 0.15 / (0.12 + 0.03) = 0.15 / 0.15 = 1.

However, this result is not possible, as probabilities must be between 0 and 1. This outcome suggests that the witness's accuracy rate may not apply equally to both genders, and we cannot make a reliable estimate based on the given information.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: Unable to provide a reliable estimate, more information is needed.}
