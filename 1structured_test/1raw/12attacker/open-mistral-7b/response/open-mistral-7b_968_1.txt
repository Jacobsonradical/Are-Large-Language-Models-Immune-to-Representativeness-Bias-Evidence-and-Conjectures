Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80%, with an error rate of 20%. However, we don't have enough information about the gender distribution of the people the witness encountered in their daily life. Therefore, we cannot directly apply this percentage to the population in the city.

The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. If we assume that the witness's gender judgment accuracy is independent of the gender distribution in the city, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

Bayes' theorem states that: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A represents the attacker being male, B represents the witness identifying the attacker as male.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 15% (given in information b).

P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, which is 0.8 (given in information a).

P(B|~A) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (assuming the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying females).

P(~A) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (given in information b).

P(B|~A) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a male attacker as female, which is not given in the information. However, as the witness errs in 20% of the cases, and we know that P(B|A) = 0.8, we can assume that P(B|~A) = 0.2.

Given these assumptions, the probability that the attacker is male (P(A|B)) can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
        = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
        = 0.12 / 0.134
        â‰ˆ 0.893

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.893 or 89.3%.
