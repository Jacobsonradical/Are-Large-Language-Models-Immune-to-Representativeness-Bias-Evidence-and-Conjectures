To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the city's demographic distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. City Demographics: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.
2. Witness's Reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, the actual probability that the attacker is male is lower than 15%. However, we can't know for sure if the witness made an error or if the attacker was indeed male given the limited information.

To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness's statement, regardless of the attacker's gender.

We know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (the city's male population), and P(B) is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A) (the probability of the witness making a mistake).

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2. Therefore, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.12 (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.667

The estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.667 or 66.7%. This means that, given the information provided, the witness's statement makes it more likely than not that the attacker is male, but it is still not a certainty.
