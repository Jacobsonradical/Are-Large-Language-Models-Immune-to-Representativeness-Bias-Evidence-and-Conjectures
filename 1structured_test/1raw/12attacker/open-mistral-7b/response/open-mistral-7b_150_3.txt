Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to account for both the actual distribution of genders in the city and the witness's error rate.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being female as P(F) and the probability of the attacker being male as P(M). We know that P(F) + P(M) = 1, and P(F) = 0.85 (since 85% of the city's population is female).

The witness identified the attacker as male. However, there's a chance that the witness made an error. We know that the witness's error rate is 20%. So, there's a 20% chance that the witness misidentified a female as male.

Thus, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can set up an equality:

0.80 * P(M) + 0.20 * P(F) = 1

We know that P(F) = 0.85, so we can substitute this into the equation:

0.80 * P(M) + 0.20 * 0.85 = 1

0.80 * P(M) + 0.17 = 1

0.80 * P(M) = 0.83

P(M) = 0.83 / 0.80 â‰ˆ 0.10375

But since the probability must be between 0 and 1, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as the actual probability is slightly less than 10.38%.

{probability: 0.10}

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 10%.
