To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. In this case, if the attacker is actually female, there's a 20% chance that the witness will mistakenly identify the attacker as male.

On the other hand, if the attacker is male, the witness will correctly identify the gender 80% of the time.

Since the city has a 15% male population, the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15%). This means there's a 0.85 (85%) chance that the attacker is female.

Given the witness's error rate, we can adjust these probabilities as follows:

- If the attacker is actually female, there's a 0.8 (80%) chance that the witness will correctly identify the attacker as female, and a 0.2 (20%) chance that the witness will mistakenly identify the attacker as male.
- If the attacker is male, there's a 0.8 (80%) chance that the witness will correctly identify the attacker as male, and a 0.2 (20%) chance that the witness will mistakenly identify the attacker as female.

Now, let's consider the probability that the witness will identify the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male (correct identification) or that the attacker is female and the witness makes an error (incorrect identification).

The probability of correct identification is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

The probability of error is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%).

So, using this information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.29, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
