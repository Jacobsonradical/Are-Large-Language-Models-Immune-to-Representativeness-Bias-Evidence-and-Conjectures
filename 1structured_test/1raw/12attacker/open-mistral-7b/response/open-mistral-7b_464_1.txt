Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify a person's gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population distribution is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate the probabilities:

P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, this is 0.8.

P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, this is 0.2.

P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. Since the population is 85% female, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

P(~H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis being false, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which is the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H) = 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
         = [0.8 * 0.15] / 1
         = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
