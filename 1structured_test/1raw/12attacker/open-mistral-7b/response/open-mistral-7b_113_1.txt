Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. A witness, whose gender identification accuracy is 80% for males and 20% for females, identified the attacker as male.

However, the witness's statement is contradictory to the city's population statistics, as the attacker's gender should have been more likely to be female, given the city's demographics.

This contradiction creates a paradox, and it's challenging to provide a reliable probability estimate based on the given information. Therefore, it would be more accurate to state that the probability cannot be determined from the provided information.

As a strict answer in the requested format:
{probability: undefined, reason: contradictory information}
