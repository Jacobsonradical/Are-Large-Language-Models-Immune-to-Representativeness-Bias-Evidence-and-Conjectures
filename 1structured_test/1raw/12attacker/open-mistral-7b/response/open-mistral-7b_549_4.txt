Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% with an error rate of 20%.
2. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city. Since the witness's ability to identify gender is not perfect, we cannot rely solely on their statement without considering the probability of making a mistake.

If we assume that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's gender, then the attacker is more likely to be female, given the city's gender distribution. Let's calculate the probability of this error:

1. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 0.2 (the error rate).
2. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male is 0.8 (the success rate).

Given that 15% of the population is male, the probability of the witness observing a male attacker is 0.15. The probability of the witness correctly identifying this male attacker is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as a male attacker is 0.2 * 0.85 (the error rate multiplied by the female proportion in the population).

So, the probability of the witness making an error and identifying a female as the attacker is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying the male attacker is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Since the witness stated that the attacker is male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the probability of the witness making the correct identification, which is 0.12.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.12} or 12%.
