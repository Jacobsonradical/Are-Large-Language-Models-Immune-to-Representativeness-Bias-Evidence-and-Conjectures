To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the relationship between prior knowledge and evidence. In this case, our prior knowledge is the proportion of males and females in the city, and our evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(M|witness) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male
- P(F|witness) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male

We are given the following information:
1. P(M) + P(F) = 1 (because the total probability of all possible outcomes is 1)
2. P(M|witness) = 0.8 (from the first piece of information)
3. P(F|witness) = 0.2 (from the first piece of information)
4. P(M) = 0.15 (from the second piece of information, as 85% of the population is female)

Now we can calculate P(witness|M), which is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male given that the attacker is actually male:

P(witness|M) = P(M|witness) * P(M) / (P(M) * P(M|witness) + P(F) * P(F|witness))

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(witness|M) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2))

Calculating this expression yields:

P(witness|M) ≈ 0.121

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability P(M) given the witness's identification:

P(M) = P(witness|M) * P(M) / (P(witness|M) * P(M) + P(witness|F) * P(F))

P(witness|F) is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, which is given as 0.2. Substituting the values, we get:

P(M) = (0.121 * 0.15) / ((0.121 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this expression yields:

P(M) ≈ 0.021

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.021 or 2.1%. This estimate is quite low given that 15% of the city's population is male, indicating that the witness's gender identification ability may not be reliable under the nighttime conditions. However, it's important to note that this estimate relies on many assumptions and simplifications, and the actual probability might be different in a real-world scenario.
