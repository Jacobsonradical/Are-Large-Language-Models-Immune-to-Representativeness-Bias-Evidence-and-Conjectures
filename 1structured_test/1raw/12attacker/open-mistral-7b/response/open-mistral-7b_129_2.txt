Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(M), and the probability that the attacker is female as P(F). The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male is P(M|witness_male), and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female is P(F|witness_male). Similarly, we have P(M|witness_female), P(F|witness_female), P(witness_male), and P(witness_female).

From the information given in "a", we know that P(M|witness_male) = 0.8 and P(F|witness_male) = 0.2. We don't have enough information to calculate P(M|witness_female), P(F|witness_female), P(witness_male), or P(witness_female) directly.

However, we do have the total error rate of the witness, which is P(F|witness_male) + P(M|witness_female) = 0.2. This means that P(M|witness_female) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(M):

P(M) = P(witness_male|M) * P(M) / [P(witness_male|M) * P(M) + P(witness_male|F) * P(F)]

From "b", we know that P(F) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15. However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(witness_male|M) or P(witness_male|F) directly.

Since the witness's gender judgments are independent of the attacker's gender, we can assume that P(witness_male|M) = P(witness_male) and P(witness_male|F) = 1 - P(witness_male).

Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to calculate P(witness_male) directly. Therefore, we cannot calculate a strict probability estimate based on the given information.

In conclusion, given the information provided, we cannot provide a numeric probability estimate for the attacker being male.
