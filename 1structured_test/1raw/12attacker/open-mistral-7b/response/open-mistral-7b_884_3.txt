To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and we don't have any information about the specific gender of the attacker, we can treat each identification as a random event with a 0.8 probability of being correct and a 0.2 probability of being incorrect.

The witness identified the attacker as male, which means this identification was correct or incorrect according to these probabilities. Since we don't know if the identification was correct or not, we need to consider both possibilities.

The probability of the witness's identification being correct is 0.8, and the probability of it being incorrect is 0.2. However, if the identification was incorrect, it must have been mistaking a female attacker for a male. Since the city is 85% female, there are more females than males. Therefore, the probability of the witness mistaking a female for a male is higher than the probability of mistaking a male for a female.

To account for this bias, we can adjust the probabilities based on the city's gender distribution. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of a random person being female is 0.85, and the probability of a random person being male is 0.15.

Given these probabilities, the probability of the witness's identification being correct (mistaking a male for a male) is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. The probability of the witness's identification being incorrect (mistaking a female for a male) is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since we don't know which probability applies, we need to consider both. The overall probability of the witness's identification being correct (mistaking a male for a male) or the identification being incorrect (mistaking a female for a male) is the sum of these probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

However, since we are interested in the probability that the attacker is male, and the identification being correct means the attacker is male, we can directly use the probability of the identification being correct as our estimate. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12.

In summary, given the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12.
