Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

The witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't know the exact gender distribution in the population from which the attacker came. We do know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F). We know that P(M) + P(F) = 1.

The witness identified the attacker as male, which means they made a correct call with a probability of P(M). Given the 80% accuracy rate, we can write an equation for P(M):

P(M) = 0.8 (number of males in the population) / (number of males + number of females)

We also know the total population is 100% female + 100% male = 200%. So, the number of males is 100% - 85% = 15%, and the number of females is 85%.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(M):

P(M) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 12%.
