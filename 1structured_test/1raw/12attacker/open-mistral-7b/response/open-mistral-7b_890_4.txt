Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male as follows:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male.
4. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, there is a 20% chance that they mistakenly identified a female attacker as male.
5. However, because the city has a majority of female population (85%), it's more likely that a random person is female.
6. Therefore, it's more likely that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually female.
7. To account for this, we can adjust the witness's identification to reflect the city's demographics.
8. Let's assume that the actual probability of the attacker being male is P.
9. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability that they correctly identified a male attacker is 0.8P.
10. Given that there are more females in the city, the probability that the witness errs and identifies a female attacker as male is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
11. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male is P = 0.12 / 0.20 = 0.6.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.6} (60%).
