Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know the general population distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, whose gender judgement accuracy is 80% correct and 20% incorrect, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the conditional probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability of the attacker being male (H1) given the witness's identification (E).

Let's denote:
- P(H1) as the prior probability of the attacker being male (85% = 0.85)
- P(H0) as the prior probability of the attacker being female (15% = 0.15)
- P(E|H1) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male (the witness's accuracy, 0.8)
- P(E|H0) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male (the witness's error, 0.2)

According to Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H0) * P(H0)]

You can calculate the probability value using the given numbers:
P(H1|E) = [(0.8) * (0.85)] / [(0.8) * (0.85) + (0.2) * (0.15)]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.71 or 71%.
