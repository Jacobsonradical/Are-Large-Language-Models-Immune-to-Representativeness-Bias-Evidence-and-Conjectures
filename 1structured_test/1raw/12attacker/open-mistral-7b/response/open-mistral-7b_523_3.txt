Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% success rate in correctly identifying gender and a 20% error rate. Since we don't have enough information to adjust this rate based on the gender distribution in the city, we can use the raw success rate.

The witness identified the attacker as male, which is a success according to their own statistics. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (or 80%).
