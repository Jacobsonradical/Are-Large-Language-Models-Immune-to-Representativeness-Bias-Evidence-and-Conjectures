Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is male
- Ā: The event that the attacker is female
- E: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

The prior probability of the attacker being male, P(A), is not provided in the information given, but we can calculate it based on the city's population data:

P(A) = number of males in the city / total population
    = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85)
    = 0.15 / 1
    = 0.15

The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female, P(E | Ā), is given as 20%:

P(E | Ā) = 0.2

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, P(E | A), is given as 80%:

P(E | A) = 0.8

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified him as male:

P(A | E) = P(E | A) * P(A) / [P(E | A) * P(A) + P(E | Ā) * P(Ā)]
         = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]
         = 0.12

So, based on the provided information and Bayes' theorem, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
