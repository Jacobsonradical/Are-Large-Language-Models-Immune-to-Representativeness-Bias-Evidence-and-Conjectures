To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. First, let's find the prior probability of the attacker being male based on the city's population distribution. Since 15% of the population is male, the prior probability is 0.15.

2. Next, we need to account for the witness's reliability. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error in this specific case.

3. The probability of the witness erring and saying the attacker is male when the attacker is actually female is 0.2 (the error rate) * 0.85 (the proportion of females in the city).

4. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male when the attacker is indeed male is 0.8 (the error rate) * 0.15 (the proportion of males in the city).

5. Since we don't know whether the witness is correct or not, we can add these two probabilities to get the posterior probability of the attacker being male: 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29.

The estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%.
