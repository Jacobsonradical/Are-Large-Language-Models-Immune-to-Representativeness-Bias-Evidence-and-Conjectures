To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possibilities:

a) The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender. In this case, the attacker is actually male.
b) The witness made an error in identifying the attacker's gender. In this case, the attacker could be either male or female, but since the victim could not see the attacker's gender, we cannot use this information to our advantage.

The probability of the witness making an error (b) is 20%, as mentioned earlier. However, since we cannot use this information to improve our estimate, we can ignore it.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender (a) is 80%. Since the attacker's gender is either male or female, and the attacker was identified as male, the probability that the attacker is male is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.8}
