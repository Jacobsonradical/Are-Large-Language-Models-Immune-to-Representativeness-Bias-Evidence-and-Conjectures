To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errors 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is female, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male as follows:

1. The probability of the witness erring and identifying a female as male is 20%.
2. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of the attacker being female, given a misidentification, is 0.85 (the proportion of females in the population).
3. So, the probability of the attacker being female, given a misidentification, is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).
4. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (83%).
5. Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, which is 0.83.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.83} (83%).
