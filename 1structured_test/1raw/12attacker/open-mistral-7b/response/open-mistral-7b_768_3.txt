Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is female, we can assume that 15% of the people the witness sees are male. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 20% * 15% = 0.03 or 3%.

On the other hand, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a female is 80% * 85% = 0.68 or 68%.

The remaining 15% of the population is male, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 80% * 15% = 0.12 or 12%.

However, we know that the witness identified the attacker as male. So, the probability that the attacker is male is the same as the probability that the witness correctly identified a male, which is 12%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.12} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.
