The given information provides two probabilities:

1. The probability that a random person in the city is male is 15% (as mentioned in point "a").
2. The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person's gender as male is 80% (as mentioned in point "b").

Since the witness's judgment of gender is not perfect (20% error rate), we cannot directly use their identification as evidence that the attacker is male. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We are given the following:
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a random person is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a male person as male)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 (probability that the witness identifies any person as male)

Now we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 66.7%.
