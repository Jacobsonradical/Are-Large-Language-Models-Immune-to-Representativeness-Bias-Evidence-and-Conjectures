To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know whether the witness's error in this case was misidentifying a female as male or a male as female, we can't adjust the error rate based on the city's gender distribution. Therefore, we'll use the 20% error rate as is.

The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male. However, since the attack was from behind, the witness might not have been able to consider this information. Therefore, for the witness, the gender distribution might as well be 50% female and 50% male.

Given this assumption, the probability of the witness identifying a male as male is 50%, and the probability of the witness identifying a male as female (an error) is 50%. However, we know that there is a 20% error rate. This means that the actual probability of the witness identifying a male as male is higher than 50%.

To find this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Witness's Identification) = P(Witness's Identification | Male) * P(Male) / [P(Witness's Identification | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness's Identification | Not Male) * P(Not Male)]

P(Witness's Identification | Male) = 0.5 (assuming the witness's error rate is 50%)
P(Male) = 0.15 (from the city's gender distribution)

We don't have enough information to calculate P(Witness's Identification | Not Male) and P(Not Male). However, we do know that P(Witness's Identification | Not Male) * P(Not Male) = 0.20 (the 20% error rate).

Since we can't calculate both P(Male) and P(Witness's Identification | Not Male), we can't provide a strict numerical answer. However, we can say that the probability that the attacker is male is likely higher than 0.15 (given the city's gender distribution) but lower than 0.5 (assuming the witness's error rate is 50%). The exact probability depends on the value of P(Witness's Identification | Not Male), which we don't have enough information to calculate.

{probability: higher than 0.15 but lower than 0.5, please note that the exact probability depends on the value of P(Witness's Identification | Not Male)}
