To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness's error rate.

1. First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being female based on the general population distribution:
   Probability of female attacker = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female)

2. Next, we need to account for the witness's error rate. Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, we can assume that they misidentified a female attacker as male 20% of the time (given that they correctly identified a male attacker as male 100% of the time).

3. Therefore, the probability of the witness misidentifying a female attacker as male is 0.20.

4. Now, let's find the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as male:
   Probability of correct male identification = 1 - Probability of error (misidentifying male as female) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

5. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can now calculate the probability that the actual attacker is male given this misidentification:
   Probability of male attacker given misidentification = Probability of correct male identification / (Probability of correct male identification + Probability of error)
   Probability of male attacker given misidentification = 0.80 / (0.80 + 0.20)
   Probability of male attacker given misidentification = 0.80 / 1.00 = 1.00

6. However, this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is applicable to the actual attacker, which might not be the case. If we assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual attacker's gender, then the probability of a female attacker being misidentified as male is the same as the overall error rate (0.20). In this case, the probability of a male attacker being misidentified as male would be 0.

7. Therefore, based on the assumption that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual attacker's gender, the probability of the attacker being male is:
   Probability of male attacker = Probability of male attacker given misidentification * Probability of misidentification + Probability of female attacker * Probability of correct identification
   Probability of male attacker = (1.00 * 0.20) + (0.15 * 0.80)
   Probability of male attacker â‰ˆ 0.30

So, based on the given information and the assumption that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual attacker's gender, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.30 or 30%.
