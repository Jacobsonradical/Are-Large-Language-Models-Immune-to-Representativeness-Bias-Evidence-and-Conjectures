Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. However, we also have a witness who correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as male.

The probability that the witness was correct in identifying the attacker as male can be calculated as the probability of the witness being correct multiplied by the probability of the attacker being male, plus the probability of the witness being incorrect multiplied by the probability of the attacker being female.

Let's calculate these probabilities:

1. Probability of the attacker being male: 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male)
2. Probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is male: 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
3. Probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is male: 0.2 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time)
4. Probability of the attacker being female: 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female)
5. Probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is female: 0.5 (since the witness correctly identifies gender 50% of the time when the gender is female)
6. Probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is female: 0.5 (since the witness is incorrect 50% of the time when the gender is female)

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness was correct:

Probability of witness being correct = (probability of attacker being male * probability of witness being correct when the attacker is male) + (probability of attacker being female * probability of witness being correct when the attacker is female)

Probability of witness being correct = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.5)

Probability of witness being correct = 0.12 + 0.425 = 0.545

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is equal to the probability that the witness was correct:

{probability: 0.545}
