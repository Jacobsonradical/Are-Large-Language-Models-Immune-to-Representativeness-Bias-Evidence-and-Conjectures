Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is male, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male.

1. P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male. This is given in the first piece of information as 0.8 (80%).

2. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we need to estimate based on the second piece of information. The second piece of information tells us that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. So, P(H) = 0.15 (15%).

3. P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male given that the attacker is female. This is also given in the first piece of information as 0.2 (20%).

4. P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is given by 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (85%).

5. P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which is the sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H) = 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 1 = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%. This might seem counterintuitive given that the witness identified the attacker as male, but it's a result of the witness's inaccuracy in judging gender and the gender distribution in the population.
