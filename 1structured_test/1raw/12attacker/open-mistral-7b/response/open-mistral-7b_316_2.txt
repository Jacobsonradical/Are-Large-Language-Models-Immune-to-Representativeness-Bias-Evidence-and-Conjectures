Given the two pieces of information, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The general population gender distribution: From the first piece of information, we know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.

2. The witness's accuracy in gender identification: The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, the second piece of information provides us with a bias in the witness's judgement. Since the witness consistently mistakes females for males at a rate of 20%, we need to account for this bias when estimating the probability of the attacker being male.

If we assume that the victim's attacker is actually a female, the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify this as a male attacker is 20%. On the other hand, if the attacker is a male, the witness would correctly identify this 80% of the time.

Given the witness's statement that the attacker is male, this implies that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender. The probability of this happening if the attacker is a female is 0.2 (20%), and the probability of this happening if the attacker is a male is 0.8 (80%).

Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.8} or 80%.
