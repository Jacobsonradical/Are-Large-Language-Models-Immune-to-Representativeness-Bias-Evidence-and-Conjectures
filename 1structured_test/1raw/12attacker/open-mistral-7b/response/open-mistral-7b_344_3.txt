Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.
2. However, we also know that the witness's ability to identify gender is not perfect. They correctly identify gender 80% of the time, but err 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios: either the witness correctly identified a male attacker, or they made an error and mistakenly identified a female attacker as male.
4. To estimate the probability of the first scenario (correct identification), we can multiply the actual proportion of male attackers by the witness's accuracy rate: 0.15 (proportion of males) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy rate) = 0.12.
5. To estimate the probability of the second scenario (mistaken identification), we can multiply the proportion of female attackers by the witness's error rate: 0.85 (proportion of females) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17.
6. Since these are the only two possibilities, their probabilities must add up to 1. So, 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (mistaken identification) = 0.29.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.29, or 29%.
