To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness's gender identification accuracy is 80%, and the city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume that the witness identifies a random person in the city. The probability that this person is female is 0.85, and the probability that this person is male is 0.15.

Given that the witness has an 80% accuracy, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%). The probability that the witness erroneously identifies a female as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the actual probability that the attacker is male is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a male and the probabilities of the witness erroneously identifying a female as male:

0.12 (probability of correct identification) + 0.17 (probability of error) = 0.29 (29%)

However, the witness's gender identification was incorrect in this case. Since the witness made an error, the actual probability that the attacker is female is the complement of the probability that the attacker is male:

1 - 0.29 = 0.71 (71%)

However, this result contradicts the initial information that the attacker's gender could not be determined. To resolve this contradiction, we need to consider that the witness's gender identification might not be reliable in this specific situation.

Since we cannot determine the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker is male cannot be calculated accurately.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: unable to calculate, please do not provide a number between 0 and 1}
