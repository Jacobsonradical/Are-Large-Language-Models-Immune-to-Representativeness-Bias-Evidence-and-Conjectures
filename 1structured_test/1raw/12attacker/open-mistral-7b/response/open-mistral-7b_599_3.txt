Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have specific numbers for how many times the witness got the gender right or wrong in this particular case. We only know that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Since we don't have enough information to calculate the probability directly, we can only provide a probabilistic interpretation based on the witness's track record. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, it's reasonable to assume that the probability that the attacker is male is also around 0.8 (or 80%), but this is an approximation and not a precise estimate based on the given data.

So, in the dictionary format: {probability: 0.8}
