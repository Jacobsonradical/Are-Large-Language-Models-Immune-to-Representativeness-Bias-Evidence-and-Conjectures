To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population gender distribution and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender.

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, the witness's identification of the attacker as male contradicts the population gender distribution (85% female). This contradiction makes it challenging to provide a straightforward probability estimate based on the given information.

A possible approach is to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's gender identification. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) \* P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as male)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability of the attacker being male in the population)
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the probability that the witness identifies any person as male)

Since we don't have the exact population size, we cannot directly compute P(H) or P(E). However, we can calculate the conditional probabilities P(E | H) and P(H | E) to evaluate the witness's credibility.

1. P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
2. P(E | ~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

To calculate P(H | E), we need to use Bayes' theorem:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) \* P(H)] / [P(E | H) \* P(H) + P(E | ~H) \* P(~H)]

Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, and the witness's accuracy is 80% and 20%, respectively, the probabilities P(H) and P(~H) are approximately:

- P(H) = 0.15
- P(~H) = 0.85

However, without knowing the population size, we cannot compute the exact numerical value for P(E). Therefore, we cannot provide a strict probability estimate in the requested format.

In conclusion, given the given information, the witness's gender identification contradicts the population gender distribution, making it challenging to provide a straightforward probability estimate. Using Bayes' theorem, we can evaluate the witness's credibility, but we cannot provide a precise probability estimate without knowing the population size.
