To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the initial population breakdown.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, and the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we can calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male:

1 - Probability of correct identification of female = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Since the population is 85% female, the probability that the witness encounters a female is 0.85. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male is 0.2.

The probability that the witness identifies a female as male and the attacker is actually female is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the attacker must be either a male or a false positive identification by the witness. The probability of a false positive is 0.17.

The probability of the attacker being male is therefore 1 - Probability of false positive = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83

{probability: 0.83}
