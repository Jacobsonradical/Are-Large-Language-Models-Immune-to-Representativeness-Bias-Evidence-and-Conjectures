Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case, event A is the attacker being male, and event B is the witness's identification of a male attacker.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male. Given that we don't have any specific information about the attacker, we can assume this probability to be equal to the proportion of males in the population. From information (b), P(A) = 15%.

2. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker as male. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

3. P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying any person as male. Since the population is half male and half female, and the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.6.

Putting it all together, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.6 = 0.12

Therefore, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 12%.
