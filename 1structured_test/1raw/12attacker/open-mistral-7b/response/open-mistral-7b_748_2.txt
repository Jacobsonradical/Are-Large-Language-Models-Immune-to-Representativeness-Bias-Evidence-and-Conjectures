Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male (from information "a").
2. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as male, but their ability to accurately judge gender is only 80% (information "b").
3. Therefore, even if the attacker was actually female, there's a chance that the witness might mistake her for a male due to their inaccuracy in gender identification (20% chance).
4. Conversely, if the attacker was actually male, the witness would correctly identify him as such most of the time (80% chance).
5. Since we don't have any additional information that might influence the gender of the attacker, we can only consider the probabilities based on the given information.

The probability estimate for the attacker being male then becomes the sum of the probability of the attacker being male and the witness misidentifying a female as male, and the probability of the attacker being male and the witness correctly identifying him:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 1 = 0.21}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.21 or 21%.
