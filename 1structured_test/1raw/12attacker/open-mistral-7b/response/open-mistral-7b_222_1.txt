Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being male, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

Let's break down the given information:
1. The prior probability of the attacker being male: We don't have this information directly, but we can infer it from the city's population data given in point b. So, P(A) = 0.15 (15% male population).
2. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender: We're given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
3. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's gender: Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(not B|A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate the probability of event B given event A:
P(B|A) = 0.8

To find P(not B|not A), we can use the law of total probability:
P(not B|not A) = P(not B|A) * P(A) + P(not B|not A) * P(not A)

Given that we don't have the prior probability of the attacker being female (P(not A)), we can't directly calculate P(not B|not A). However, we can calculate it indirectly using the given witness accuracy:

P(not B|not A) = 1 - P(B|not A)

Since we don't know P(B|not A), we can't calculate the exact probability of the attacker being male. However, we can calculate a range based on the given witness accuracy.

To do this, let's assume that P(B|not A) is either 0 or 1. If P(B|not A) = 0, then the witness always identifies males as females, and the probability of the attacker being male (P(A)) cannot be higher than the witness's error rate. So, in this case, the maximum probability of the attacker being male is P(A) = 0.2.

On the other hand, if P(B|not A) = 1, then the witness always identifies females as males, and the probability of the attacker being male would be 0. If this were the case, the witness would never correctly identify a male attacker, so the probability of the attacker being male would be 0.

Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of P(B|not A), we can't calculate an exact probability for P(A). However, we can use the given witness accuracy to calculate an upper bound and a lower bound.

The lower bound would be the witness's error rate, P(A) = 0.2.
The upper bound would be the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness always identifies females as males, which is 0.

Therefore, based on the given information, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being male is between 0 and 0.2. However, without more information, a precise probability cannot be calculated.
