Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is generally correct in 80% of their gender identification and incorrect in 20% of their cases, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually male, we can consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

The attacker's actual gender is either male (M) or female (F). Let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

1) If the attacker is male (M):
   - The probability of being mistakenly identified as female by the witness is 20% (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time).

2) If the attacker is female (F):
   - The probability of being incorrectly identified as male by the witness is 80% (since the witness is correct only 20% of the time with female individuals).

Now, we have two probabilities for an incorrect identification: 0.2 for males and 0.8 for females. The total probability of an incorrect identification is the sum of these probabilities:

Total probability of incorrect identification = 0.2 (for males) + 0.8 (for females) = 1

Since the total probability of incorrect identification should be less than 1, it seems there's an inconsistency in the information provided. The witness's incorrect identification rate is too high for both genders to be consistent with the given population distribution.

As a result, we cannot provide a reliable probability estimate based on the information provided. It is essential to reconsider the witness's ability to identify genders under low-light conditions or double-check the population data to ensure consistency.
