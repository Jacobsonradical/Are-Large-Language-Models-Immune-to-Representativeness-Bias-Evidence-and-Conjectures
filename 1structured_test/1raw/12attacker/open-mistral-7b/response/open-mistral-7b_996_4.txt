Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. In this case, the witness identified the attacker as male, which means the witness's judgment was correct 80% of the time or incorrect 20% of the time.
3. Given that the population is 85% female and 15% male, it's likely that the majority of people the witness encounters are female.
4. Therefore, if the witness misidentifies a person as male, it's more likely that the actual person is female, not male.
5. However, since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that the attacker is indeed male in 80% of the cases where the witness makes a correct identification, and in 0% of the cases where the witness makes an error.
6. To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification: 0.8 (probability of correct identification) * 0.15 (probability of attacker being male given a population of 15% male) + 0 (probability of correct identification given an error) * 0.85 (probability of attacker being female given a population of 85% female) = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
