To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and we know that 85% of the population is female, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 20%.

However, the witness identified the attacker as male, which means there was a misidentification. Since the probability of misidentifying a female as male is 20%, the probability of misidentifying a male as female must be the complementary probability, i.e., 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Now, we need to find out how likely it is for the witness to misidentify a male as female and still end up with a statement that the attacker is male. This happens when the attacker is actually female and the witness mistakes her for a male. The probability of this event is 0.15 (the proportion of males in the city) * 0.80 (the probability of misidentifying a male as female).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is 1 - 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.84.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.84}.
