Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is generally correct in identifying gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.

Let's consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: The witness was correct in identifying the attacker's gender. In this case, the attacker is actually male.
Scenario 2: The witness was incorrect in identifying the attacker's gender. In this case, the attacker is female, despite the witness's statement.

The probability of Scenario 1 happening is the probability of the witness being correct, given that the attacker is male. Since the city's population is 15% male, the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

The probability of Scenario 2 happening is the probability of the witness being incorrect, given that the attacker is female. Since the city's population is 85% female, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85. The probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is female is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

However, since we have received a witness statement that the attacker is male, we should only consider Scenario 1. The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness statement, is the probability of Scenario 1 happening, which is 0.12.

So, {probability: 0.12} is the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided.
