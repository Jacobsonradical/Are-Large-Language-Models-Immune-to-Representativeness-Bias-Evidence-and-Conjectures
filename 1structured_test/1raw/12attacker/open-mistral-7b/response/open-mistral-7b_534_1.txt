Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider: the gender distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender.

1. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80% (correctly identifying gender in 8 out of 10 cases) and incorrect 20% of the time.

However, the witness's gender identification was not accurate in this specific case. The witness identified the attacker as male, but we don't know if the witness was correct or not because the victim could not see the attacker's gender.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can assume that the witness's incorrect identification is an error and consider it as evidence against the attacker being male. In this scenario, we would need to adjust the 15% male population proportion to account for the witness's error.

Let's assume the witness's error rate is applied to the 15% male population proportion. In that case, the adjusted probability of the attacker being male would be lower than 15%.

Unfortunately, without more specific information about the witness's error in this case, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate. Therefore, the best answer would be:

{probability: unable to provide a precise number, but the probability is likely lower than 15%}
