Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% probability of correctly identifying a person's gender. However, we don't know the exact gender distribution in the group the witness was observing. If we assume that the gender distribution in the group the witness observed is also 50% male and 50% female, then the witness's 80% success rate implies that the attacker is actually male 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies a male.

On the other hand, if we assume that the gender distribution in the group the witness observed is not 50% male and 50% female, but rather it follows the city's gender distribution (85% female and 15% male), then the witness's 80% success rate implies that the attacker is actually male a lower percentage of the time.

Without more information, it's not possible to provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. However, based on the witness's ability to judge gender, it seems likely that the attacker is male, but the exact probability depends on the gender distribution in the group the witness observed.
