To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's errors are more likely to be in favor of misidentifying males as females or females as males. Let's assume for now that the errors are evenly distributed (which might not be the case, but we'll use this assumption to keep the calculation simple).

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male:

Probability of witness identifying male correctly = Probability of male in population * Witness's accuracy in identifying male
                                                                          = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                                          = 0.12

Since we don't have enough information to consider the possibility of the witness's errors in identifying gender, we can only estimate the probability based on the witness's correct identifications. Therefore, our estimate is 12% (or 0.12) that the attacker is male.
