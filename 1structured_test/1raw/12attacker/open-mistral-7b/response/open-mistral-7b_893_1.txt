To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). We know that the witness identifies males as males with a probability of 0.8 (80%). So, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male if the attacker is indeed male is 0.8.

On the other hand, the witness errs by identifying a female as male with a probability of 0.2 (20%). Given that the city's population is 85% female, the probability that the witness errs by identifying the attacker as male if the attacker is actually female is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since we don't have any information about the attacker's gender, we can consider both possibilities (male and female) and calculate the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male.

P(male | identified as male) = P(male) * P(identified as male | male) + P(female) * P(identified as male | female)

Substituting the given values:

P(male | identified as male) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.17 = 0.12 + 0.1465 = 0.2665

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.2665} or approximately 26.65%.
