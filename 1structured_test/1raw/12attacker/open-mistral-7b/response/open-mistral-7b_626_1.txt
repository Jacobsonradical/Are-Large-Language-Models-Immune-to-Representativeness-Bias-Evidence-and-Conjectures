To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can't be 100% certain that the attacker is actually male because of the possibility of the witness making an error. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B (P(A|B)) is equal to the probability of event B given event A (P(B|A)) times the prior probability of event A (P(A)) divided by the probability of event B (P(B)):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is the attacker being male, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

First, let's find P(A):
P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is male)

Next, let's find P(B|A):
Since the witness was correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8

Now, we need to find P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies a female attacker as male. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.
P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is female, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So, P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = (0.8) * (0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.2414

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 24.14%.
