To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male (before considering the witness's statement)
- P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male (an error)

Given that we know the witness's accuracy rate and gender distribution in the population, we can calculate these probabilities as follows:

1. P(M) = 15% (since 15% of the city's population is male)
2. P(F) = 1 - P(M) = 85% (since 85% of the city's population is female)
3. P(w|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
4. P(w|F) = 0.2 (the witness errs and identifies females as males 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is male (P(w|M)) and the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is female (P(w|F)):

5. P(w|M) = 0.8
6. P(w|F) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (since the witness errs 20% of the time, but only 85% of the city's population is female)

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male (P(M|w)) using Bayes' theorem:

7. P(M|w) = P(w|M) * P(M) / [P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)]

Calculating the probability:

P(M|w) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12, or 12%.
