To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. The population distribution: 15% of the city's population is male.
2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, we have an additional piece of information: the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male. This means that if the attacker was actually female, the witness would have correctly identified the attacker as female 80% of the time. But since the witness identified the attacker as male, the attacker must be male.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 1 (or 100%), as the witness's incorrect identification effectively rules out the possibility that the attacker is female.

So, the answer is: {probability: 1}
