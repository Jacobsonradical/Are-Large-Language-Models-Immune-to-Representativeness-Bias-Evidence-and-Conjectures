To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

First, let's calculate the expected number of correct and incorrect gender identifications by the witness in 100 trials (assuming equal opportunities for male and female subjects):

1. Correctly identifying a male: Probability of selecting a male = 0.15, and the witness correctly identifies 80% of the time = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
2. Correctly identifying a female: Probability of selecting a female = 0.85, and the witness correctly identifies 80% of the time = 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68
3. Incorrectly identifying a male: Probability of selecting a male = 0.15, and the witness errs 20% of the time = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03
4. Incorrectly identifying a female: Probability of selecting a female = 0.85, and the witness errs 20% of the time = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Now, let's sum up the expected number of correct and incorrect gender identifications:

Correctly identifying a male: 12
Correctly identifying a female: 68
Incorrectly identifying a male: 3
Incorrectly identifying a female: 17

The total number of trials is 100 (correct + incorrect), so the expected number of male and female subjects in the sample should also be 50 each.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can only consider the cases where the witness correctly identified a male or incorrectly identified a female:

1. If the attacker is male: The witness correctly identifies the attacker 12 times out of 50 trials (24%).
2. If the attacker is female: The witness incorrectly identifies a female 17 times out of 50 trials (34%).

However, the witness did identify the attacker as male, so we only need to consider the probability of the attacker being male in this case: 12% (correctly identifying a male) + 34% (incorrectly identifying a female) = 46%.

Now, we need to account for the actual gender distribution in the city: 15% of the population is male. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that the attacker is indeed male. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city, is the actual proportion of males in the population:

{probability: 0.15}
