To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80%, but we also know that there is a 15% chance of the attacker being male in the city.
2. To calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, we can multiply the witness's accuracy by the actual probability of the attacker being male.

probability = witness's accuracy * actual probability of attacker being male
probability = 0.8 * 0.15
probability = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%. This may seem counter-intuitive given that the witness identified the attacker as male, but it's important to consider the reliability of that identification in the context of the actual gender distribution in the city.
