Based on the provided information, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and incorrectly identify it as 20%.
2. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume there are 100 people in the city for simplicity. According to the second piece of information, there are 85 females and 15 males.

The witness identified the attacker as male. The probability of this happening if the attacker is a male is 1 (since the attacker is indeed male in this case). However, there's also a chance that the witness made an error and misidentified a female as male.

The probability of this happening is the witness's error rate, which is 20%. So, if the attacker is female, the probability that the witness misidentifies her as male is 0.2.

Since there are 15 males and 85 females, the probability of the attacker being female given the witness's statement is the probability of the witness making an error, which is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.8}
