Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' Theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes known. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness correctly identified a male attacker 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis)

We are given that:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a male attacker 80% of the time)
- P(H) = Unknown (the prior probability of the attacker being male)
- P(E) = Unknown (the probability of the witness identifying any person as male, regardless of their actual gender)

However, we can find the value of P(E) using the information about the gender distribution in the city:

P(E) = P(E|M) * P(M) + P(E|F) * P(F)

Where:
- P(E|M) is the probability of the witness identifying a male as male (0.8)
- P(M) is the probability of the attacker being male (the value we are trying to find)
- P(E|F) is the probability of the witness identifying a female as male (assuming this is an error)
- P(F) is the probability of the attacker being female (0.15)

We know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(E|F) = 0.2. Now we can find the value of P(E):

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find the probability that the attacker is male:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [0.8 * P(M)] / 0.29

Since P(H|E) is a probability, it must be between 0 and 1. We can solve for P(M) to find the probability that the attacker is male:

P(M) = [0.8 * P(H|E)] / 0.29

Unfortunately, without a specific value for P(H|E), we cannot provide a numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is male. However, we can say that the probability is greater than 0.26 (since 0.8 * 0.26 > 0.29) and less than 1 (since 0.8 * 1 > 0.29).

In summary, based on the information provided, we cannot provide a precise numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is male, but we can say that it is greater than 0.26 and less than 1.
