To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we should consider both the city's population statistics and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. The city's population statistics (as given in point "a") suggest that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.

2. The witness's reliability in gender identification (as given in point "b") is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that there is a 80% chance that the witness was correct in their identification and a 20% chance that they were incorrect.

However, we also know that the city's population is heavily female, and it is unlikely that the witness would mistake a female for a male so often. This implies that when the witness identifies someone as male, they are likely to be correct more often than 80%.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(M). The probability that the witness was correct given that the attacker is male is P(M), and the probability that the witness was incorrect given that the attacker is male is 1 - P(M).

The probability that the witness was correct (given the information we have) is the witness's reliability: 0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * (1 - P(M)) = 0.8

So, we have the equation: 0.8 = 0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * (1 - P(M))

Simplifying this equation, we get: 0.6 = 0.8 * P(M)

Solving for P(M), we find that the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.75 or 75%.
