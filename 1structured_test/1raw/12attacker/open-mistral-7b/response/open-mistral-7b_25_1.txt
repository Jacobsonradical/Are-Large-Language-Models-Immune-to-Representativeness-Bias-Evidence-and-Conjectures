Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). The probability that the witness misidentified the attacker's gender, given that the attacker is actually male, is 20%. Similarly, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender, given that the attacker is male, is 80%.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male:

P(male) = P(witness identifies as male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) / [P(witness identifies as male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness identifies as male | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female)]

We know the values of P(witness identifies as male | attacker is male) = 0.8 and P(attacker is female) = 0.15. To find P(witness identifies as male | attacker is female), we can use the principle of total probability:

P(witness identifies as male | attacker is female) = P(witness identifies as male and attacker is female) / P(attacker is female)

Given that the witness mistakes gender 20% of the time, the probability that they misidentify a female as male is also 0.2:

P(witness identifies as male | attacker is female) = 0.2

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(male) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the result, we get:

P(male) = 0.12 / 0.168 â‰ˆ 0.7157 or 71.57%

So, based on the witness's identification and the population demographics, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 71.57%.
