Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. According to the first piece of information, the population is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The second piece of information tells us that the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender and a 20% error rate.
3. However, the witness made an error in this specific case, as they identified the attacker as male.
4. So, if the witness's error rate is 20%, and they made an error in this case, it means the attacker is more likely to be female (since the majority of the population is female).

The probability that the attacker is female can be calculated as:

1 - Witness's error rate = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Since the witness made an error, and their error rate is 0.2, the attacker is more likely to be female than male. Therefore, the probability estimate for the attacker being male is:

{probability: 0.15, please note that this is the initial population percentage of males in the city, as we cannot rely on the flawed witness's identification.}

However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on unreliable information, as the witness's identification was incorrect. In a situation with more reliable evidence, a more accurate probability estimate could be made.
