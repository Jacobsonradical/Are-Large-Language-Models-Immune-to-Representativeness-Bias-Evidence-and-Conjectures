To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can consider two scenarios:

1. The attacker's gender is actually male (true positive, TP).
2. The attacker's gender is actually female (false positive, FP), and the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male.

We are given the following information:

a) The population is 85% female and 15% male.
b) The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that the event happened in scenario 1 or 2. The probability of being in scenario 1 (TP) is the probability of the attacker being male in the population, which is 15%. The probability of being in scenario 2 (FP) is the probability of the attacker being female, times the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male.

Let's use P(M) to denote the probability of the attacker being male, P(F) for female, and P(wM|M) for the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, and P(wM|F) for the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male.

We know that P(F) = 1 - P(M) = 0.85.

Given a sample of people, half female and half male, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means:

P(wM|M) = 0.8
P(wF|F) = 0
P(wF|M) = 0.2
P(wM|F) = 1

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write the probability of the event as the sum of the probability of being in scenario 1 (TP) and the probability of being in scenario 2 (FP):

P(wM) = P(TP) + P(FP)

To find P(TP), we need to multiply the probability of the attacker being male by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male:

P(TP) = P(M) * P(wM|M)

To find P(FP), we need to multiply the probability of the attacker being female by the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male:

P(FP) = P(F) * P(wM|F)

So, the probability of the event is:

P(wM) = P(M) * P(wM|M) + P(F) * P(wM|F)

We can substitute the given values:

P(wM) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0

P(wM) = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.12}
