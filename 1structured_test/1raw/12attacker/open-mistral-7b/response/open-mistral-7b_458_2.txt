To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The gender distribution in the city: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

The witness mistakenly identifies a female as male 20% of the time. Since the city has a higher proportion of females, we should expect a larger number of misidentifications to be of females as males.

Let's consider two scenarios:
a) The attacker is actually female. In this case, the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male 20% of the time.
b) The attacker is actually male. In this case, the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male 80% of the time.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is female as P(f) and the probability that the attacker is male as P(m). We know that P(f) + P(m) = 1.

We are given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Given this information, we should consider both scenarios (a) and (b), with their corresponding probabilities, weighted by the witness's reliability.

1. If the attacker is actually female (P(f)), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male is P(f) * 0.20 (the 20% error rate).
2. If the attacker is actually male (P(m)), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male is P(m) * 0.80 (the 80% correct rate).

The witness identified the attacker as male, so we can write an equation:

0.80 * P(m) + 0.20 * P(f) = 1

To solve for P(m), we can rearrange the equation:

P(m) = (1 - 0.80 * P(f)) / 0.20

However, we do not have a direct value for P(f). We only know that P(f) + P(m) = 1, and that 85% of the population is female. Therefore, we can write:

P(f) = 0.85

Substitute P(f) into the equation for P(m):

P(m) = (1 - 0.80 * 0.85) / 0.20

P(m) â‰ˆ 0.28

The probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.28 or 28%.
