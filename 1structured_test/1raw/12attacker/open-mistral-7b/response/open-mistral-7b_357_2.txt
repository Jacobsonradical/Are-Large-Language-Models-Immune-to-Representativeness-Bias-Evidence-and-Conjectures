To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker being male)
- E is the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Given the information provided, we have:
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female, so the prior probability of the attacker being male is 15%)

We don't have enough information to calculate P(E), but we can assume that it's equal to the sum of P(E | H) and P(E | ~H), where ~H represents the attacker being female. Since the witness was wrong 20% of the time, P(E | ~H) = 0.2.

However, since we don't know the exact number of people in the city, we can't calculate the exact values of P(H) and P(E | ~H). Instead, let's assume that the number of people in the city is large enough so that the sample size used to determine the witness's ability to judge gender is representative of the whole population.

Under this assumption, we can approximate P(H) and P(E | ~H) as follows:
- P(H) ≈ 0.15
- P(E | ~H) ≈ 0.2

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
≈ 0.284

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.284 or 28.4%.
