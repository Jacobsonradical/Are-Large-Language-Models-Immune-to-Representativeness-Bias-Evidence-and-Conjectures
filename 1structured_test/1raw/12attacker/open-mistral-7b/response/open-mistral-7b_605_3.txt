To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification, along with the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's gender identification accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The gender distribution in the city: The city has an 85% female population and a 15% male population.

Let's assume that the attacker's gender is actually M (male), and we want to find the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as M. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the probability that the witness makes an error is 0.2.

The probability that the attacker is a female (F) is 0.85, and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies M as F is also 0.2. So, the probability that the attacker is a female and the witness incorrectly identifies the gender is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is a male and the witness correctly identifies the gender is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

Now, we know that the witness identifies the attacker as a male. Given that the witness's identification might be incorrect, we need to account for the possibility that the attacker is actually a female and the witness makes an error.

The probability that the attacker is a female and the witness incorrectly identifies the gender as M is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%. The probability that the attacker is a male and the witness correctly identifies the gender is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

Since the witness identifies the attacker as a male, we want to find the probability that the attacker is actually a male, given the witness's identification. This probability is the sum of the probabilities that the attacker is a male and the witness correctly identifies the gender (0.12) and the probability that the attacker is a female and the witness makes an error (0.17).

So, the probability that the attacker is a male, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.29}.
