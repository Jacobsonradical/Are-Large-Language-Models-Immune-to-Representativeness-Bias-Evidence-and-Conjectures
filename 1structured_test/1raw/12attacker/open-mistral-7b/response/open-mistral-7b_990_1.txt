To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the initial population distribution and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male).

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we know that P(male) + P(female) = 1, and P(female) = 0.85.

The witness correctly identifies gender in 80% of the cases and errs in 20% of the cases. In other words, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 0.2.

The witness identified the attacker as male. If the attacker were indeed male, the witness would have correctly identified the gender. If the attacker were female, the witness would have erroneously identified the gender.

Given that we are interested in the probability of the attacker being male, we can compute this probability by considering both the initial population distribution and the witness's reliability:

P(male) = P(witness correctly identifies a male) * P(male in the population) + P(witness incorrectly identifies a female as male) * P(female in the population)

P(witness correctly identifies a male) * P(male in the population) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

P(witness incorrectly identifies a female as male) * P(female in the population) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

P(male) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%. This means that there is a 29% chance that the attacker is male based on the given information.
