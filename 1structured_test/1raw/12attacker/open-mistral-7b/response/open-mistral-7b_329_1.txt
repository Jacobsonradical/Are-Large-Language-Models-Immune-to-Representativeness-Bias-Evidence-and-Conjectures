This is a probability problem that involves Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

From the problem statement, we have two pieces of prior information:
1. The population is 85% female and 15% male. This gives us the prior probability of H: P(H) = 0.15
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and errors 20% of the time. This gives us the likelihood of E given H: P(E|H) = 0.8

Since the witness's ability to identify gender is the same for males and females, we can assume that the likelihood of E given not H (P(E|~H)) is also 0.8. Here, ~H denotes the hypothesis that the attacker is female.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of H given E:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.1024

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 10.24%.
