Given the two pieces of information provided, we can't directly use the population statistics (85% female, 15% male) to estimate the attacker's gender because the victim couldn't identify the attacker's gender. Instead, we should rely on the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, they mistakenly identified the attacker as male. This means that there's a 20% chance that they made an error in this specific case (given that the attacker's gender is actually unknown to us).

If we assume that the witness's error rate is uniformly distributed, then the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement is the complement of the error rate. In other words:

{probability: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8}

This means that, given the witness's statement, we estimate that the attacker is male with a probability of 0.8 or 80%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's error rate is uniformly distributed, which might not be the case in reality.
