Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80% (correctly identifying the gender of 80% of the people they see).
2. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

However, it's important to note that the witness made an error 20% of the time in their gender identification, and we don't know if the error was in identifying males as females or females as males. Without this information, we can't make a definitive estimate about the probability that the attacker is male.

If we assume that the error rate is evenly distributed between identifying males as females and females as males, then the witness's 80% accuracy rate means they correctly identified the gender 80% of the time, and they made an error in 20% of the cases (100% - 80%). But since we don't know whether these errors were biased towards misidentifying males as females or females as males, we can't use this information to make a probability estimate.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I must conclude that I cannot provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. It would require additional information or a different approach to make such an estimate.

{probability: undefined, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
