To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the gender distribution in the city is equally likely (50% male, 50% female), then the probability that the witness would identify a male as male is 0.8 (80%), and the probability that the witness would identify a male as female is 0.2 (20%).

However, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female. This means that if the attacker is actually female, the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male is 0.15 (15%), and if the attacker is male, the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male is 0.8 (80%).

Since we don't know the gender of the attacker, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (regardless of the attacker's gender) by multiplying the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker and of the attacker being male. This gives us 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

On the other hand, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying the attacker as male (regardless of the attacker's gender) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker and of the attacker being female. This gives us 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

Since the witness's statement is that they identified the attacker as male, we should add the probabilities of the witness being correct and of being mistaken. This gives us 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%).

However, this calculation assumes that the gender distribution in the city is equally likely (50% male, 50% female). Given that 85% of the population in the city is female, it might be more reasonable to assume that the witness's baseline error rate of 20% is biased towards misidentifying males as females. In this case, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female attacker would be lower than 0.2, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker would be higher than 0.8. This would increase the probability of the attacker being male.

Without more information, it is difficult to quantify this effect. However, it is clear that the witness's statement alone is not sufficient to establish a strong probability that the attacker is male. The probability that the attacker is male is likely to be somewhere between 0.12 (12%) and 0.29 (29%), but it could be higher or lower depending on the exact relationship between the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city.

{probability: 0.29, please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions, and a more accurate estimate would require additional information}
