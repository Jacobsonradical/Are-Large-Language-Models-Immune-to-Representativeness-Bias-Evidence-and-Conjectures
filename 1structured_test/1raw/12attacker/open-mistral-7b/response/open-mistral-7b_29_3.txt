To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a principle of conditional probability used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's define our variables:

- H: The attacker is male
-  ~H: The attacker is not male (female)
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as male

We are given the following probabilities:

P(E|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies males 20% of the time)
P(H) = Unknown probability that the attacker is male
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = Unknown probability that the attacker is female

The total population is composed of 85% females and 15% males. So, P(~H) = 0.85 and P(H) = 0.15.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Plug in the given values:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85))

Calculate the result:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.227

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 22.7%.
