To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability of a correct identification is 0.8.

Next, let's consider the gender distribution in the city. According to the information provided, 15% of the population is male.

Now, we can combine these probabilities to estimate the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender as male. This probability can be calculated as the product of the two probabilities: 0.8 (probability of correct identification) times 0.15 (probability of the attacker being male).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is: {probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
