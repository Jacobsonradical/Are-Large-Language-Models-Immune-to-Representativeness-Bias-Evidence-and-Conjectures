To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since we don't have specific information about the gender of the attacker, we can't directly apply the population distribution. Instead, we'll use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probabilities based on the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A divided by the probability of B. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given the probabilities of A and B:
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a male)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being female)

To find P(A|B), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating the probabilities:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.256

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 25.6%.
