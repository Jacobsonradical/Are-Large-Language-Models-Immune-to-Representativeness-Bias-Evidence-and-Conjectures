To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male). The probability of the witness misidentifying the gender is 1 - P(male) = 0.2 (from given information).

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability of correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 * P(male). The witness errs 20% of the time, and since there are more females in the city (85%), the probability of erring and identifying a female as the attacker is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The witness's total success rate in identifying genders is 80%, so we can write the equation:

0.8 * P(male) + 0.17 = 0.8

Solving for P(male):

P(male) = (0.8 - 0.17) / 0.8 = 0.63

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.63 (63%).
