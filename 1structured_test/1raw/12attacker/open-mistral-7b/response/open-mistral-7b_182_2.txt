To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's error rate is biased towards misidentifying males as females or females as males. Let's assume for now that the error rate is uniform, meaning the witness makes an equal number of mistakes in both directions.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct given that the attacker is male:

Probability of correct identification given male attacker = Witness's accuracy rate for male = 0.8

Similarly, we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct given a female attacker:

Probability of correct identification given female attacker = Witness's accuracy rate for female * Probability of female attacker = 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is female given the witness's identification is:

Probability of female attacker given witness's identification = 1 - Probability of male attacker given witness's identification = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

However, we cannot directly use this probability to estimate the probability that the attacker is male, as it assumes that the witness's error rate is uniform, which is not given.

Therefore, without further information about the witness's error rate or bias, it is not possible to provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. The best we can say is that the attacker is more likely to be female (given the city's gender distribution), but the witness's identification suggests otherwise. This is a conflict between two pieces of evidence, and further investigation would be needed to resolve it.

In conclusion, I cannot provide a specific number for the probability that the attacker is male. However, based on the information given, it seems that the attacker is more likely to be female, but the witness's identification suggests otherwise.
