Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

First, we have a witness who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness is equally likely to err in identifying a male or a female, then the probability of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8 (80%) and the probability of the witness identifying a male as female is 0.2 (20%).

Second, we have information about the gender distribution in the city, with 85% female and 15% male.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is male by multiplying the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male by the proportion of males in the population.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12, or 12%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.12}
