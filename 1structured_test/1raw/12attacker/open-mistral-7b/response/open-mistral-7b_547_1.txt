To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

In this case, our events are:
1. H0: The attacker is female.
2. H1: The attacker is male.

Let's define some variables:
P(H0) = Prior probability of the attacker being female (given the city's population, we know this is 0.85)
P(H1) = Prior probability of the attacker being male (1 - P(H0))

P(W|H0) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female (0.2, since the witness was wrong 20% of the time)
P(W|H1) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male (1 - P(W|H0)) = 0.8 (since the witness was right 80% of the time)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's report:

P(H1|W) = P(W|H1) * P(H1) / [P(W|H1) * P(H1) + P(W|H0) * P(H0)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H1|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this gives us a probability of approximately 0.21, or 21%.

So, based on the given information, we estimate that the attacker is male with a probability of approximately 0.21.
