The information given consists of two parts: 1) The city's population composition, and 2) The witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

1) The city's population composition is 85% female and 15% male.
2) The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, which means they correctly identify gender 80% of the time.

Now, let's consider the two possibilities:
A) The attacker is female. In this case, the witness would incorrectly identify the gender 20% of the time.
B) The attacker is male. In this case, the witness would correctly identify the gender 80% of the time.

Given the information, we cannot know if the attacker is female or male. However, we do know that the witness is more likely to correctly identify a male attacker than a female one, given their error rate.

Let's calculate the probability of each scenario:
A) If the attacker is female, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is 0.2 (or 20%).
B) If the witness identifies the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is higher than the probability that the attacker is female. Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, the probability of a female being identified as male is 0.2. But, since there are more females than males in the city, the probability that the witness is identifying a male attacker when they say "male" is less than 0.2. We can calculate this probability by dividing the male population proportion by the error rate: 0.15 / 0.2 = 0.75 (or 75%).

However, the witness also incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time. If the witness identifies the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually female is 0.2. But, since there are more females than males in the city, the probability that the witness is identifying a female attacker when they say "male" is higher than 0.2. We can calculate this probability by multiplying the female population proportion by the error rate: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Since the probability of a female being identified as male is higher than 0.2, and the probability of a male being identified as male is less than 0.75, the overall probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is a weighted average of these two probabilities. The weight for the first probability (0.17) is the probability of a female being incorrectly identified as male, and the weight for the second probability (0.75) is the probability of a male being correctly identified as male.

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is 0.17 * 0.2 + 0.75 * 0.7 = 0.35 (or 35%).

However, the original question asked for the probability that the attacker is male, not given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Since we cannot know if the attacker is male or female, we cannot calculate an exact probability. But, given the information, the probability that the attacker is male is higher than the city's male population proportion because the witness is more likely to correctly identify a male attacker than a female one.
