To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's gender is random, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's observation.

Bayes' theorem is written as: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the attacker being male, B is the witness identifying the attacker as male, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, and P(B) is the probability of the witness making the observed statement, regardless of the attacker's gender.

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time), and P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.28 (the overall probability of the witness making the observed statement, regardless of the attacker's gender).

The prior probability, P(A), is the probability of the attacker being male in the population. We are given that 85% of the population is female, so the probability of the attacker being male is 15% or 0.15.

Using these values, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's observation:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.357 (the estimated probability that the attacker is male)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.357 or 35.7%.
