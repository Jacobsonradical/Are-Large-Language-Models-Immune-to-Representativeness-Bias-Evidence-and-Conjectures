To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's errors are more likely to be mistakes in identifying males or females. Without this information, we can't adjust the 80% success rate for the witness.

Now, let's consider the gender distribution in the city. Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of a random person being male is 0.15.

Since we don't have enough information to adjust the witness's accuracy rate, we can't directly apply the witness's success rate to this probability. Therefore, the best estimate we can make is that the attacker is male with a probability of 0.15 (or 15%), which is the same as the male population proportion in the city.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.15}
