Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

1. The witness has a 80% probability of correctly identifying gender and a 20% probability of error.
2. However, we don't know if the witness's error rate is biased towards misidentifying males or females.
3. We also don't have any information about the gender of the person the witness misidentified in this specific case.
4. The city's gender demographic (85% female and 15% male) is different from the witness's error rate, which could affect the probability estimate.

Given these uncertainties, it's difficult to provide a precise probability estimate based on the information provided. Therefore, I would suggest a conservative approach and say that the probability that the attacker is male is likely to be around the 15% city population rate (0.15), but with a significant degree of uncertainty.

However, to get a more accurate estimate, additional information would be needed, such as the witness's bias in gender misidentification or the specific gender the witness misidentified in this case.
