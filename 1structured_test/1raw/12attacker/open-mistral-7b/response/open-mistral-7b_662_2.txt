To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability.

1. The population statistics suggest that 15% of the city's population is male.
2. However, the witness's reliability is also a factor. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time, this means that even when the actual person is male, the witness might incorrectly identify them as female 20% of the time.

To incorporate both factors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is expressed as: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this context, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identifies a male.

We are given P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability), which is the probability that a random person is male, and P(B|A) = 1 (the likelihood), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, given that the person is actually male.

The probability P(B) is the probability of the witness's identification, which includes both correct and incorrect identifications. Since the witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time, and incorrectly 20% of the time, P(B) = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.83.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.83 â‰ˆ 0.181.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 18.1%.
