Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% (with a 20% error rate).
2. The population ratio of males to females is 15% to 85%.

Since we do not have any direct evidence about the gender of the attacker, we can only make an estimate based on the witness's report and the population ratio. However, the witness's ability to identify gender is not perfectly accurate, so we need to account for this error.

Let's assume that the attacker is actually female and the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male. In this case, the probability that the witness makes an error is 20%.

On the other hand, if the attacker is male, then the probability that the witness correctly identifies the gender is 80%.

Given that the population ratio of males to females is 15% to 85%, the probability of the attacker being male (P(male)) is the product of the probability of the witness making a correct identification and the probability of the attacker being male in the population:

P(male) = P(witness correctly identifies as male) * P(attacker is male)

P(witness correctly identifies as male) = 0.8 (from the information)
P(attacker is male) = 0.15 (given population ratio)

So, P(male) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
