Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence about the attacker's gender: the city's demographics and the witness's identification.

1. According to the city's demographics, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male. This means that the probability of a random person being male is 0.15.

2. The witness's ability to judge gender under similar conditions was 80% accurate and 20% inaccurate. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this is one of the 80% correct identifications.

However, we don't have enough information to calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification in this specific case. We only know the probability of correct identification in general.

Therefore, based solely on the city's demographics, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15. However, considering the witness's identification, we can only say that the probability is at least 0.8 (80%), but it might be higher or lower depending on the specific circumstances of the identification. Without more information, we cannot provide a more precise estimate.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.15 (with some uncertainty due to the witness's identification)}
