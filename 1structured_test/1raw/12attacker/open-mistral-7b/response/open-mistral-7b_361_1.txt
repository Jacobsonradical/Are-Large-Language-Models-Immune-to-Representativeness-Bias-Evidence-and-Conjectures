Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is male, E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male, and we are trying to find P(H|E).

The terms in the equation are as follows:

1. P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being male, which we don't have direct information about but we can estimate based on the city's gender distribution. From information b, 15% of the city's population is male, so P(H) = 0.15.

2. P(E|H): The probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. This is given in the first piece of information as 0.8.

3. P(E|~H): The probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male given that the attacker is female. Since the witness is less accurate in identifying females, we can assume that this probability is less than 0.8. From the first piece of information, we know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, so P(E|~H) = 0.2.

4. P(~H): The probability that the attacker is female, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

5. P(E): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender. This is the probability of P(E|H) times the probability of H plus the probability of P(E|~H) times the probability of ~H. P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E) = [(0.8) \* (0.15)] / (0.29) = 0.241

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.241, or 24.1%.
