To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume that the attacker's gender is either 'male' or 'female' with equal probability (0.5) before the witness makes the identification. Given the witness's ability to identify gender, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness making an error and misidentifying the attacker as male is 0.2 (20%).

To account for the gender distribution in the city, we can multiply the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male by the proportion of males in the city and the probability of the witness erring by misidentifying a female attacker as male by the proportion of females in the city.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is:
0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

The probability of the witness erring by misidentifying a female attacker as male is:
0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (either correctly or erroneously):

Total probability = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.29}
