To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the overall gender distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender.

1. The overall gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

Given this information, the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a female attacker as male is 20%, and the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker as such is 80%.

However, we cannot directly apply these probabilities to the overall population distribution because the witness's errors might skew the estimated probability. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
A: The attacker is male
B: The witness identifies the attacker as male
P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being male (given by the city's gender distribution)
P(B|A): The likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker correctly (80%)
P(B): The probability of the witness making the observed statement B (given both A and not-A, i.e., the union of both possibilities)

Since we do not have enough information to calculate P(B) directly, we can use the law of total probability to rewrite it as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)

Given that the witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80% and 20%, respectively, we can calculate P(B|not-A) as 20%.

However, since we do not know the number of female attackers, we cannot calculate the exact probability of a female attacker. Instead, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's statement and the overall gender distribution.

The estimated probability that the attacker is male (given the witness's statement) is:

{probability: 0.73, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This estimate suggests that, given the witness's statement, it is more likely that the attacker is male than female, but the actual probability may be different if we had more information about the number of female attackers.
