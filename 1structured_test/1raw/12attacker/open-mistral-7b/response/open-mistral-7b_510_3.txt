Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's gender and a 20% chance of making an error. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there is a 0.8 probability that the witness was correct in their identification. However, we don't have enough information about the gender distribution in the group of people the witness observed that night to directly calculate the probability that the attacker is male.

To provide an estimate, we can consider the bias in the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city. Since 85% of the population is female, it's likely that the witness's sample was also biased towards more females. Given this bias and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender 80% of the time, it seems unlikely that the witness would mistakenly identify a male as female (given the city's gender distribution) 20% of the time.

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the actual probability of the attacker being male is higher than 80%. However, without more specific information, it's not possible to provide a precise number between 0 and 1. Therefore, the best estimate I can provide is that the probability that the attacker is male is greater than 0.8, but less than 1.

{probability: greater than 0.8, but less than 1}
