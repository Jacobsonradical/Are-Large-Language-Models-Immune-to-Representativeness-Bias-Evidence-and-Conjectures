Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and the city's population is 15% male. However, we need to consider that the witness also errs 20% of the time, which means they may incorrectly identify a female as male.

Let's denote the probability of a female being misidentified as male as p. Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, we can write an equation:

0.2 = 0.2 * 0.85 (probability of a female) + p * 0.15 (probability of a male)

Solving for p, we get:

p = 0.2 - 0.17 = 0.03

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification:

P(male | identified as male) = P(identified as male | male) * P(male) / (P(identified as male | male) * P(male) + P(identified as male | female) * P(female))

Substituting the values we have, we get:

P(male | identified as male) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.03 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12, or 12%.
