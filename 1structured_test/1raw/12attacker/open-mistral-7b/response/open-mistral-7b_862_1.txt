To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- p as the probability that the attacker is male
- q as the probability that the attacker is female

We know that p + q = 1 and that q = 0.15 (as stated in the question).

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's gender 20% of the time, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80. This means that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 0.20.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we have two possibilities:
1) The witness correctly identified the attacker as male, which happens with probability 0.80p.
2) The witness incorrectly identified another person as male, which happens with probability 0.20p.

The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(witness identifies attacker as male) = 0.80p + 0.20p = 1.00p

However, we have an additional piece of information: the witness's identification matches the true gender of the attacker 50% of the time (since the witness is correct half the time). So, the probability that the witness's identification matches the true gender of the attacker is 0.50.

Given that the witness's identification matches the true gender of the attacker, the attacker must be male. Therefore, the probability that the witness's identification matches the true gender of the attacker and the attacker is male is:

P(witness identifies attacker as male and attacker is male) = 0.50 * P(witness identifies attacker as male)

Substituting P(witness identifies attacker as male) from the previous equation, we get:

P(witness identifies attacker as male and attacker is male) = 0.50 * 1.00p = 0.50p

Since we know that this probability is equal to 0.50, we can solve for p:

0.50p = 0.50
p = 1

However, this solution is not within the required range of probabilities (0 <= p <= 1). This means that the witness's identification is inconsistent with the actual gender distribution in the city. It's possible that the witness made an error, and the attacker is actually female.

Therefore, without more information, it's not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. The information provided is contradictory.
