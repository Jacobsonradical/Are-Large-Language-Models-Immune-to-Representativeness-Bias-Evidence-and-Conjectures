Given the information provided, the population is 85% female and 15% male. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as male, but with an error rate of 20%. This means that out of 100 times the witness identifies a person's gender, they get it wrong 20 times.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, it could mean that the attacker is indeed male, or it could be an error on the part of the witness. Since we know the witness's error rate, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male based on this.

Let's say there's a 50% chance that the witness made an error (since their error rate is 20%, there's a 80% chance they got it right). If they made an error, then the attacker is actually female, despite the witness's identification.

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is equal to the probability that the witness got it right plus the probability that they got it wrong and the attacker is still male.

The probability that the witness got it right is the actual proportion of male attackers in the population, which is 15%. The probability that they got it wrong and the attacker is still male is equal to the population proportion of male attackers times the probability that the witness errs in identifying a male as female.

This probability is 15% * 20% = 0.03 or 3%.

So, the total probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is 15% + 0.03 = 18.03%.

However, since probabilities must be between 0 and 1, we can round this estimate to 18%.

{probability: 0.18}
