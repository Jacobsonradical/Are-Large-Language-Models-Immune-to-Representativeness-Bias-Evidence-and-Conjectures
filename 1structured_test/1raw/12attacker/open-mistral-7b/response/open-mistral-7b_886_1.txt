To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

First, let's calculate the expected number of correct gender identifications by the witness in a random sample of people. Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, and the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the expected number of correct identifications for females is 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68. Similarly, the expected number of correct identifications for males is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The total number of people in the sample is 0.85 (females) + 0.15 (males) = 1. So, the expected number of correct gender identifications in a random sample of one person is 0.68 (females) + 0.12 (males) = 0.8.

However, the witness identified the attacker as male, which is an incorrect identification for 85% of the population. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the inverse of the expected probability of the witness making an error:

{probability: 1 - 0.8 = 0.2}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.2, or 20%. This means that there is a 20% chance that the attacker is actually male, given the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city. It's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's gender identification ability is constant, which might not be the case in real life.
