To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Attack) = P(Attack | Male) * P(Male) / [P(Attack | Male) * P(Male) + P(Attack | Female) * P(Female)]

We are given that P(Attack | Male) = 1 (since the attack occurred), and we want to find P(Male).

P(Female) = 0.85 (given in the information)
P(Attack | Female) = 0.2 (witness's error rate in identifying males)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Male) = P(Attack | Male) * P(Male) / [P(Attack | Male) * P(Male) + P(Attack | Female) * P(Female)]
P(Male) = (1 * 0.15) / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(Male) = 0.0225 / 0.2025
P(Male) â‰ˆ 0.111 (11.1%)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.111 or 11.1%.
