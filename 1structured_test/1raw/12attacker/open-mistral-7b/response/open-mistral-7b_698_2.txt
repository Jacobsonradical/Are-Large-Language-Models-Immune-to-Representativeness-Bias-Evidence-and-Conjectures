To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F) = 1 - P(M).

The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. Since the gender distribution is equal (50% male and 50% female), the witness's errors are evenly distributed between the two genders. So, the witness errs and misidentifies a male as female 10% of the time, and errs by misidentifying a female as male 10% of the time.

The witness's statement that they correctly identified the gender 80% of the time means that the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male is 0.8. This probability can be calculated as follows:

P(M|Correct_witness) = Number of correct male identifications / Total number of correct identifications
                                         = 0.8

Since the erroneous identifications are evenly distributed between the genders, we can also say that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.1.

Now, we know that the witness identified the attacker as male, so the probability we're interested in is P(M), the probability that the attacker is actually male. This probability can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(M) = P(Correct_witness|M) * P(M) / P(Correct_witness)

We know P(Correct_witness|M) = 0.8, and we want to find P(M). The total number of people in the city is a mix of females (P(F)) and males (P(M)), so P(Correct_witness) = P(Correct_witness|M) * P(M) + P(Correct_witness|F) * P(F).

Given that the population is 85% female and 15% male, we have P(F) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15. We also know that P(Correct_witness|F) = 0.1.

Now, we can calculate P(Correct_witness):

P(Correct_witness) = P(Correct_witness|M) * P(M) + P(Correct_witness|F) * P(F)
                                 = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85
                                 ≈ 0.13

Finally, we can calculate P(M):

P(M) = P(Correct_witness|M) * P(M) / P(Correct_witness)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.13
     = 0.8 * 0.1154
     ≈ 0.0923

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.0923 or 9.23%.
