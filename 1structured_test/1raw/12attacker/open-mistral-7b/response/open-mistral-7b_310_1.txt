Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that the general population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. However, we also have information that a witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, let:
- A be the event that the attacker is male
- B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

The probability of A (the attacker being male) given B (the witness's identification) can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, which is 1 (since the witness is correct for males in this case). P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15%).

P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, which is 0.2 (since the witness is incorrect for females 20% of the time). P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85 (85%).

Plugging these values into the formula:

P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.15 / 0.32 = 0.46875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.47 or 47%.
