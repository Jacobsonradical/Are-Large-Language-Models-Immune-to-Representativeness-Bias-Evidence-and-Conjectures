Given the information provided, we have a witness who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male. However, we don't know if the witness's ability to identify gender is biased towards one gender or not.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). Then, the probability that the witness identifies a male as male is P(male) and the probability that the witness identifies a female as male is 0.15 * P(male) (since 15% of the population is male).

Similarly, the probability that the witness identifies a male as female is 0.2 * P(male) (since 20% of the time the witness errs) and the probability that the witness identifies a female as female is 0.85 * P(male) + 0.8 * 0.15 * (1 - P(male)) (since the witness correctly identifies a female as female 80% of the time and mistakenly identifies a male as female 20% of the time when the actual gender is female).

The witness identified the attacker as male, so we have the equation: 0.8 * P(male) + 0.2 * 0.15 * (1 - P(male)) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time).

Solving this equation, we get P(male) = 0.5.

So, based on the given information, we estimate that the probability that the attacker is male is 50%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions, and the actual probability could be different.
