To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and the city has an 85% female population, we can calculate the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a male attacker as female.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as p (where 0 ≤ p ≤ 1), and the probability of the attacker being female as 1 - p.

The probability of the witness erring in identifying a male attacker as female is given by the probability of drawing a female from the population, which is 1 - p, and then incorrectly identifying the gender, which happens 20% of the time:

Probability of error = (1 - p) * 0.2

Now, the witness identified the attacker as male. This means that the attacker must be male or that the witness made an error. So, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male as the sum of the probability of the attacker being male and the probability of the witness erring:

p = Probability of attacker being male + Probability of error

We can rewrite the equation as:

p = 1 - Probability of error

p = 1 - [(1 - p) * 0.2]

Solving for p, we get:

p = 0.8 / (1.2 - 0.2 * (1 - p))

p ≈ 0.588

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.588 or 58.8%.
