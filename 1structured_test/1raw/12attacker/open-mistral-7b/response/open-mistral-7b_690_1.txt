Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, a witness, who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the actual gender distribution in the city and the witness's error rate. The witness's observations might be skewed due to their error rate.

Let P(male) be the probability that the attacker is male, and Q(male) be the probability that the witness identifies someone as male, given that they are actually male.

We are given that Q(male) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy) and P(male) = 0.15 (actual gender distribution).

The witness might have identified a female as male due to their error, so we can write the equation for the total probability of the witness identifying someone as male:

Q(male) = P(male) * Probability of witness correctly identifying a male + P(female) * Probability of witness mistakenly identifying a female as male

We are given that Q(male) = 0.8, and P(male) = 0.15. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8 - the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male.

Let E be the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, E = 0.2.

So, 0.8 = 0.15 * Probability of witness correctly identifying a male + 0.85 * E

Substitute E with 0.2 and solve for the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male:

0.8 = 0.15 * (0.8 - 0.2) + 0.85 * 0.2
0.8 = 0.15 * 0.6 + 0.175
0.8 = 0.09 + 0.175

Now, we can find the probability of the attacker being male (P(male)):

P(male) = (Probability of witness correctly identifying a male) / (Q(male))
P(male) = (0.6) / (0.8)
P(male) = 0.75

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.75, or 75%.
