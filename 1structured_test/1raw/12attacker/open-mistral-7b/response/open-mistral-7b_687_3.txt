Given the information provided, let's reason through the problem:

1. We have a witness who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
3. However, we don't know if the witness's error rate is biased towards either gender. For example, if the witness has a tendency to misidentify males as females, the actual probability of the attacker being male might be higher than 15%.
4. Without more information about the nature of the witness's errors, it's not possible to provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

So, strictly answering the question in the dictionary format:
{probability: Unable to provide a number due to lack of sufficient information}
