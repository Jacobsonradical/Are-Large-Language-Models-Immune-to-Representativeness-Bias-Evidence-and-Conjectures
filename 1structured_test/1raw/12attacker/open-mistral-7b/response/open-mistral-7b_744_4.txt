Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male
- P(w) as the probability that the witness makes an identification

From the information provided, we know that:
- P(M) + P(F) = 1
- P(w|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time)
- P(w|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male 20% of the time)
- P(w) = P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)

We also know the gender distribution in the population from information (b):
- P(M) = 0.15
- P(F) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(w):
- P(w) = P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:

P(M|w) = P(w|M) * P(M) / P(w)

Plugging in the values:

P(M|w) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.275

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.275 or 27.5%.
