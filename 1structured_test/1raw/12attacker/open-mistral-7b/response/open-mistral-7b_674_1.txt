To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness's error rate. Since we cannot directly observe the gender of the attacker, we can only make an educated guess based on the information available.

Let's denote:
- p as the probability that the attacker is male
- q as the probability that the attacker is female (1 - p)
- w as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male
- e as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female

From the information given, we know that q = 0.15 and w = 0.8 (given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time). However, we don't have direct information about e, the error rate for identifying males as females.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, we can infer that e = 0.2 (given that the total error rate is 20%).

Now, let's consider the situation when the witness sees the attacker and makes a judgment. The witness would identify the attacker as male with probability w for a male attacker and with probability e for a female attacker. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can formulate the following equation:

0.8p + 0.2(1-p) = 1

Solving for p, we get:

p = 0.75

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.75}. This means that, given the information available, it is estimated that the attacker has a 75% chance of being male.
