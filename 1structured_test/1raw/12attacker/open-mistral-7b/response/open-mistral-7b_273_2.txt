To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. The population statistics suggest that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80%, with a 20% error rate.

However, the witness misidentified the attacker's gender, and we don't know if the error was in favor of the majority (female) or the minority (male). If we assume that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed between both genders, then the probability of the witness erring on a female and a male is equal (20% each).

Now, since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can infer that the actual error occurred when identifying a female as male. In this case, the probability of the attacker being female is 20%, and the probability of the attacker being male is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.80}.
