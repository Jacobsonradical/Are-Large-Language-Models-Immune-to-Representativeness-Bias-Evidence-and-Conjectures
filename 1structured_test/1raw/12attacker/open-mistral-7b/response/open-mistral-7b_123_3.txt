To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, we can assume that the erroneous identifications are equally distributed between male and female. This means that for every 100 people, the witness incorrectly identifies 20 people as the opposite gender.
4. Of those 20 errors, we would expect 15 to be women misidentified as men (given that 85% of the population is female).
5. This leaves us with 5 erroneous identifications of men as women.
6. So, in total, there are 100 * 0.85 female individuals + 5 erroneous female identifications = 85.85 female individuals.
7. Similarly, there are 100 * 0.15 male individuals + 5 erroneous male identifications = 15.15 male individuals.
8. Now, the witness correctly identifies 80% of the time, which means they correctly identify 85.85 * 0.8 = 72.72 female individuals and 15.15 * 0.8 = 12.12 male individuals.
9. The witness erroneously identifies 20% of the time, which means they incorrectly identify 85.85 * 0.2 = 17.17 female individuals as male and 15.15 * 0.2 = 3.03 male individuals as female.
10. So, the total number of correctly identified female individuals is 72.72 + 17.17 = 89.89.
11. The total number of correctly identified male individuals is 12.12 + 3.03 = 15.15.
12. The total number of individuals in the city is 100 * 0.85 + 5 erroneous female identifications = 85.85 + 5 = 90.85.
13. The total number of erroneous identifications is 17.17 female individuals misidentified as male + 3.03 male individuals misidentified as female = 20.20.
14. The witness correctly identifies 15.15 male individuals out of a total of 90.85 individuals, and erroneously identifies 17.17 female individuals as male.
15. The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male individual is therefore 15.15 / 90.85 = 0.1664.
16. Given that the witness incorrectly identifies 17.17 female individuals as male, we can assume that the actual number of male individuals in the city is 15.15 + x, where x is the number of erroneously identified male individuals.
17. Since the witness identifies a male individual 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identifies a male, is x / (15.15 + x).
18. The witness's identification of the attacker as male is erroneous with a probability of 20%, so the actual probability that the attacker is male is (0.1664 * x) / (0.1664 * x + 0.8 * (100 - x)).

The probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.418.
