To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being male, and the new evidence is the witness's statement and the gender distribution in the city.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In our case:
- A is the attacker being male
- B is the witness's statement and the gender distribution in the city

The witness's statement gives us the probability of the witness identifying a male as male, given that the person is actually male: P(B|A) = 0.8

The gender distribution in the city gives us the prior probability of the attacker being male: P(A) = 0.15

The probability of the witness making a mistake, i.e., identifying a female as male, is P(not B|A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2

So the probability of the witness making a mistake given that the attacker is female is P(B|not A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female)

The probability of the witness making a mistake, regardless of the attacker's gender, is P(not B) = P(not B|A) * P(A) + P(not B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.2125

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2125 â‰ˆ 0.56

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the gender distribution in the city, is approximately 0.56 or 56%.
