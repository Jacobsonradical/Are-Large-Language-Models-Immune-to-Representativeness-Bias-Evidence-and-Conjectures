To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being male as P(M), and the probability of the witness misidentifying a female as male as E(F|M). The witness identified the attacker as male, so either the attacker is actually male (P(M)) or the witness made an error (E(F|M)).

We know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time (1 - E(F|M)) and errs 20% of the time (E(F|M)). Since there are more females than males in the city, we can assume that the majority of people the witness encounters are females. Therefore, the probability of the witness encountering a female and correctly identifying her gender as such is higher than the probability of encountering a male and correctly identifying him as such.

Let P(F) be the probability of the attacker being female. Since 85% of the population is female, P(F) = 0.85.

Given this information, we can write two equations:

1) P(M) + E(F|M) = Witness's identification
2) P(M) = P(M|Correct identification) * Probability of correct identification + P(M|Error) * Probability of error

Let's break down the second equation:

a) P(M|Correct identification) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified a male as such)
b) Probability of correct identification = 0.8 (given in the information)
c) P(M|Error) = 0 (since the witness never correctly identified a female as male)
d) Probability of error = 0.2 (given in the information)

Now, let's solve the equations:

1) P(M) + E(F|M) = Witness's identification
2) P(M) = 0.8 * P(M|Correct identification) + 0 * P(M|Error)

Since P(M|Correct identification) = 1 and P(M|Error) = 0, we can simplify the second equation:

2) P(M) = 0.8

Now, we can substitute P(M) = 0.8 into the first equation:

1) 0.8 + E(F|M) = Witness's identification

We don't have enough information to directly compute E(F|M). However, we can make an educated guess based on the given information. Since the witness is more likely to correctly identify a female as such, we can assume that E(F|M) is lower than the overall error rate of 20%. A reasonable guess might be around 15%.

So, if E(F|M) = 0.15, then 0.8 + 0.15 = 0.95, which is closer to the witness's identification than the true gender distribution in the city.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems likely that the attacker is male, but the exact probability is difficult to calculate without more information about the witness's error rate in gender identification.

{probability: 0.9, please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and a reasonable assumption about the witness's error rate in gender identification}
