To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the overall gender distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male).

First, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female and 15% is male. This information suggests that P(male) = 0.15 (since P(female) + P(male) = 1 and P(female) = 0.85).

However, we also have information about the witness's ability to identify gender. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a male, they correctly identify him as male 80% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can update our estimate of P(male) based on the witness's accuracy. The probability that the witness identified a male correctly given that the attacker is actually male is 0.8 (the witness's success rate).

On the other hand, the probability that the witness identified a male incorrectly given that the attacker is actually female is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our estimate of P(male):

P(male | witness's statement) = P(witness's statement | male) * P(male) / [P(witness's statement | male) * P(male) + P(witness's statement | not male) * P(not male)]

We know that P(witness's statement | male) = 0.8 and P(male) = 0.15. We don't have direct information about P(witness's statement | not male), but we can calculate it using the witness's error rate:

P(witness's statement | not male) = P(not male) * (1 - P(witness's statement | male)) = 0.85 * (1 - 0.8) = 0.17

Now we can calculate P(male | witness's statement):

P(male | witness's statement) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * (1 - 0.15)] = 0.12

So our updated estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.12 or 12%. This is significantly lower than the overall gender distribution in the city, indicating that the witness's statement may not be reliable in this specific case.
