To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the city's demographics and the witness's reliability.

1. The city's demographics suggest that 15% of the population is male.
2. However, the witness's reliability is also important. They correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, and they have a 80% success rate in gender identification, this suggests that the attacker might be male.
4. However, we need to account for the fact that the witness made an error 20% of the time. In this case, they misidentified a female as male.
5. Given that 85% of the population is female, it's more likely that the witness made an error in this case than that the attacker is actually male.
6. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, considering both the city's demographics and the witness's reliability, might be lower than 15%.

However, without more specific information, it's difficult to provide an exact number. A more precise calculation would require knowing the weight of the witness's identification compared to the city's demographics, which isn't provided in the information given.

{probability: less than 15%, but exact number cannot be determined without more information}
