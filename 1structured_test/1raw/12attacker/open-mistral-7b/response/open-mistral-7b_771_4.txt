To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is usually represented as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In our case, we have:
- H: The attacker is male
- E: The witness identified the attacker as male

We are given the following information:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time)
- P(H) = Unknown (prior probability of the attacker being male)
- P(E) = We need to calculate this using the given population statistics

The population statistics are given as:
- 85% of the population is female (P(~H))
- 15% of the population is male (P(H))

Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, we can calculate P(~E|H) as 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.18
P(E) = 0.3

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.3
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.3
P(H|E) = 0.4

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.4 or 40%.
