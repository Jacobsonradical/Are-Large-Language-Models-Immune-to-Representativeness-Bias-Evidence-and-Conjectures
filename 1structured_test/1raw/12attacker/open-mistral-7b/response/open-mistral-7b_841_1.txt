Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, whose ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's error rate. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we can assume that some of the time when the witness identifies someone as male, they are actually misidentifying a female.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (P(M)) and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker (P(F)).

P(M) = Probability of a male attacker * Probability of witness correctly identifying a male attacker
     = 0.15 * 0.8
     = 0.12

P(F) = Probability of a female attacker * Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male
     = 0.85 * 0.2
     = 0.17

Now, we know that the witness identified the attacker as male. The probability of this happening given that the attacker is male is P(M), and the probability of this happening given that the attacker is female is P(F). Since the attacker could be either male or female, we need to add these probabilities to find the overall probability.

P(Attacker is male | Witness identified as male) = P(M) + P(F) * Probability of witness mistakenly identifying a female as male
                                                            = 0.12 + 0.17 * 0.2
                                                            = 0.12 + 0.034
                                                            = 0.154

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the information provided is approximately 0.154 or 15.4%.
