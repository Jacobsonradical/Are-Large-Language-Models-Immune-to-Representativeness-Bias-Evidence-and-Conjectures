To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female attacker as male.

Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female. Since 85% of the population is female, P(F) = 0.85. The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker is P(M) * 0.80.

On the other hand, since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female attacker as male is P(F) * 0.20.

The witness identified the attacker as male, so we can set up an equation: P(M) * 0.80 + P(F) * 0.20 = 1

Solving for P(M), we get P(M) = 0.952381 (approximately 95.24%)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.952381} (approximately 95.24%)
