To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M) and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F).

Given the witness's ability to judge gender, we know that they incorrectly identify a male as female 20% of the time. This means that they correctly identify a male 80% of the time. So, the probability of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8, and the probability of them misidentifying a male as female is 0.2.

Now, let's consider the gender distribution in the city. We know that 85% of the population is female, so P(F) = 0.85, and the probability of the population being male is P(M) = 1 - P(F) = 0.15.

The witness identified the attacker as male. If the attacker was indeed male, the witness would be correct. However, if the attacker was female, the witness would incorrectly identify her as male 20% of the time.

So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male is P(M) = 0.15. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is P(F) * 0.2 = 0.17 (since 85% of the population is female).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male is the sum of these two probabilities: P(M) + P(F) * 0.2 = 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.2655

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.2655 or 26.55%.
