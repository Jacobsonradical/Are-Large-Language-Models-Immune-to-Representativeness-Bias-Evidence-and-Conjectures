To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

The witness's statement that the attacker is male should be considered an observation with a probability of error. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male as the probability of the witness making an accurate observation (80%) multiplied by the true probability of the attacker being male, and then divided by the total probability of the witness's observation.

Let P(M) be the probability of the attacker being male, and P(F) be the probability of the attacker being female. Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can write:

P(M) = 0.15
P(F) = 0.85

The probability of the witness making an accurate observation (identifying a male as male) is P(M) * 1 (since the witness is always 100% correct when the attacker is male), and the probability of the witness making an error (identifying a female as male) is P(F) * 0.2 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is female).

The total probability of the witness's observation (identifying the attacker as male) is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(witness observation | attacker is male) = P(M) * 1
P(witness observation | attacker is female) = P(F) * 0.2

The total probability of the witness's observation is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(witness observation) = P(witness observation | attacker is male) * P(M) + P(witness observation | attacker is female) * P(F)
P(witness observation) = (P(M) * 1) + (P(F) * 0.2)

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's observation. We can do this by dividing the probability of the witness making an accurate observation (identifying a male as male) by the total probability of the witness's observation:

P(M | witness observation) = P(witness observation | attacker is male) / P(witness observation)
P(M | witness observation) = (P(M) * 1) / [(P(M) * 1) + (P(F) * 0.2)]

Substituting the values for P(M) and P(F), we get:

P(M | witness observation) = (0.15 * 1) / [(0.15 * 1) + (0.85 * 0.2)]
P(M | witness observation) = 0.15 / 0.21
P(M | witness observation) = 0.7143

The probability estimate that the attacker is male, given the witness's observation, is approximately 0.7143 or 71.43%.
