Given the information provided, the city's population is 85% female and 15% male. However, we also have a witness who, under similar conditions, was able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time and erroneously identified gender 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we should consider the witness's error rate and the prior probability of the attacker being male (given by the city's population).

Let's denote the prior probability of the attacker being male as P(M), and the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a female as male as P(E|F). Then, we have:

P(M) = 0.15 (the city's population is 15% male)
P(E|F) = 0.20 (the witness's error rate)

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male is 1 - P(E|F) = 0.80.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement is:

P(M|W) = (P(M) * P(W|M)) / (P(M) * P(W|M) + P(~M) * P(W|~M))

where P(W|M) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, and P(W|~M) is the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a female as male. We know that P(W|M) = 0.80 and P(W|~M) = P(E|F) = 0.20.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(M|W), we get:

P(M|W) = (0.15 * 0.80) / (0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.20)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.14)
       = 0.12 / 0.26
       = 0.4615

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.46 or 46%.
