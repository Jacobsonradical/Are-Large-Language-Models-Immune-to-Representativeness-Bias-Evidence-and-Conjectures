To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

A) The attacker is actually male, and the witness correctly identified the gender.
B) The attacker is female, and the witness made an error in identifying the gender.

Let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

A) Probability of the attacker being male (P(M)): 15% (15/100)

B) Probability of the witness erring and saying the attacker is male (P(F|M)): 20% (20/100)

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male is the inverse of the probability of erring, which is 1 - P(F|M) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

So the probability of both events A and B happening is P(M) * P(F|M) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, since we already know that the witness identified the attacker as male, this scenario is not relevant to our estimation. Instead, we should only consider scenario B, where the attacker is female, and the witness makes an error.

B) Probability of the attacker being female (P(F)): 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

B) Probability of the witness erring and saying the attacker is male (P(M|F)): 20% (20/100)

The probability of both events B and B' happening is P(F) * P(M|F) = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

Given the available information, it is more likely that the attacker is female (17%) than male (12%). However, it's worth noting that the witness's ability to accurately identify gender under poor lighting conditions might have influenced these estimates. A more detailed or accurate witness account could provide more reliable information.
