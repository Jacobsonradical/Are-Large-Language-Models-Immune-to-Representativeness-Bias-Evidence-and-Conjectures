To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the population.

The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. Since the attacker's gender is not known, the probability that the witness misidentified a female attacker as male is 20%.

On the other hand, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. This means that the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker is also 80%.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85. The probability that the attacker is male is therefore 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

However, we need to account for the witness's error rate. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, the actual probability of having a male attacker, given that the witness identifies the attacker as male, is 0.15 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.12.

So, based on the witness's testimony and the gender distribution in the population, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12.
