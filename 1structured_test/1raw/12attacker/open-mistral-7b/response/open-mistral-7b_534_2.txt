To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

From the information provided, we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a person, they will correctly identify a male as male 80% of the time and a female as female 80% of the time. However, they will mistakenly identify a male as female 20% of the time and a female as male 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as male, but we need to account for the possibility that the witness made a mistake. Since the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, the probability that the witness saw a male is 15%. We also know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when they see a male.

So, the probability that the witness saw a male and correctly identified him is 15% * (1 - 0.2) = 13.5%. However, there's also the possibility that the witness saw a female and mistakenly identified her as male. The probability of this happening is 85% * 0.2 = 17%.

Therefore, the total probability that the witness saw a male and correctly identified him, or saw a female and mistakenly identified her as male, is 13.5% + 17% = 30.5%.

Since we know that the attacker is either male or female, and the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the proportion of cases where the witness correctly identified a male or mistakenly identified a female as male.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 13.5% / 30.5% = 0.44 or 44%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.44} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.
