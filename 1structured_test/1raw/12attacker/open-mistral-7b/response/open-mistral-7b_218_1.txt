Given the two pieces of information, we have a population that is 85% female and 15% male. However, we also have a witness who, in similar conditions, was able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time and erroneously identified gender 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as male. But since we don't have information about the witness's accuracy in this specific situation, we cannot rely solely on their identification. Instead, we can use the population statistics to make an estimate.

The witness's error rate of 20% suggests that, in general, they misidentify the gender 20% of the time they encounter a person. However, we know that the population is heavily female (85%). If the witness's error rate is 20%, we can infer that they are more likely to incorrectly identify a female as male than the other way around, due to the gender imbalance in the population.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, and given the population statistics, it seems more likely that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually female. However, without more specific information about the witness's accuracy in this situation, it is not possible to provide a precise numerical estimate.

Therefore, it is not appropriate to provide an estimate in the requested format. A more detailed investigation would be needed to make a reliable probability estimate.
