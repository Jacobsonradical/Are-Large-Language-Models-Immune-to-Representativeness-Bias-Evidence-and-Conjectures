Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a rule that allows us to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's testimony and the gender distribution in the city.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break it down:
1. P(E | H) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, given that the attacker is actually male. This is given as 0.8 in the question.
2. P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. Since we have no information about the attacker before the event, this is assumed to be equal to the probability of the attacker being male in the general population. Given that 15% of the population is male (from information b), P(H) = 0.15.
3. P(E) is the probability of the evidence. This is the probability of the witness identifying any person as male, regardless of their actual gender. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(E) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a male) + 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying a female as male) * 0.15 (probability of a female being in the population) = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83.

Now, we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.83 â‰ˆ 0.12

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
