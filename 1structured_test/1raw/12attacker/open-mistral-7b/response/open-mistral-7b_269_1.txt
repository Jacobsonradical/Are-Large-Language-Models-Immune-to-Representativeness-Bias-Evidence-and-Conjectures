To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make some assumptions.

The first piece of information (a) tells us that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. However, this does not directly give us information about the gender of the attacker.

The second piece of information (b) tells us that a witness who is accurate 80% of the time and mistaken 20% of the time identified the attacker as male. This suggests that the witness's identification of the attacker as male is likely to be correct more often than not, but it does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker is male) based on new evidence (in this case, the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (the witness identified the attacker as male)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

We are given P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is male) and P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male).

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)

where ~H is the negation of the hypothesis (the attacker is not male). Since we are not given any information about P(E|~H), we cannot calculate P(E) directly.

However, we can make an assumption about P(E|~H) based on the accuracy of the witness. If the witness is equally accurate in identifying gender when the person is female, then we can assume that P(E|~H) = 0.8 as well.

Under this assumption, P(E) = 0.12 (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.8 \* 0.85).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can then estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.75

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.75 (75%).

So, {probability: 0.75}
