To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an assumption about the independence of the witness's gender perception and the true gender of the attacker.

Given that the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender, we can say that in 80% of cases, the witness correctly identifies the gender of the person they are observing. However, we do not know if this 80% accuracy rate is influenced by the gender of the person being observed or if it is a general accuracy rate.

The second piece of information tells us that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This information is not directly relevant to the witness's ability to identify gender, but it could potentially influence the base rate of male attackers in the city.

Assuming that the witness's gender perception is not biased towards male or female attackers, and given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually male.

{probability: 0.8, please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions, and actual probabilities may vary}
