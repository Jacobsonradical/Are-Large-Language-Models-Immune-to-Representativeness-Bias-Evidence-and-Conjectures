Given the two pieces of information, we have a population with an 85% female majority and a 15% male minority. However, a witness who is not perfect in identifying gender correctly stated that the attacker was male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male).

From the population statistics, P(male) = 0.15 (since 15% of the city's population is male).

The witness has an 80% success rate in correctly identifying gender and a 20% error rate. When the witness says the attacker is male, we can't immediately assume it's true, as there's a chance of error.

Let's denote the probability of the witness making an error as P(error). Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(error) = 0.2.

From the information given, we know that P(error) = P(not male | male stated) * P(male) + P(error | male stated) * P(not male).

Since the witness is consistent, P(error | male stated) = P(error) = 0.2, and P(error | not male stated) = 1 - P(error) = 0.8.

Now, we can set up a system of equations:

P(error) = P(not male | male stated) * P(male) + P(error | male stated) * P(not male)
0.2 = (1 - P(male)) * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)

Solving for P(male), we get:

P(male) = 0.15 * (1 - 0.2 / 0.15) / (1 - 0.2) = 0.15 * 0.8 / 0.8 = 0.15

However, since the witness stated that the attacker was male, the error probability P(error) cannot be used directly to estimate the probability of the attacker being male. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the initial probability P(male) based on the witness's statement:

P(male | male stated) = P(male stated | male) * P(male) / [P(male stated | male) * P(male) + P(male stated | not male) * P(not male)]

We don't know P(male stated | male) directly, but we do know it's greater than 0.8 and less than 1, as the witness is more likely to correctly identify a male than not. Let's denote it as X.

So,

P(male | male stated) = X * 0.15 / [X * 0.15 + (1 - X) * (1 - 0.15)]

To find the best estimate, we need to find the maximum value of this probability function with respect to X. This can be done by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero, which gives:

X = 1

However, this value of X is not feasible, as it implies the witness is perfect in identifying gender, which contradicts the 20% error rate given. Therefore, we can't find a single accurate estimate for P(male | male stated) and can only provide a range based on the given information.

In conclusion, based on the witness's statement and the uncertainty in their ability to identify gender, the probability that the attacker is male is likely greater than 0.15 (15%) but less than 1. A more precise estimate would require additional information about the witness's performance in gender identification.
