Given the two pieces of information, we have a population that is predominantly female (85%) and a witness who is somewhat reliable in identifying gender, but makes errors 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as male.

However, it's important to note that the witness's statement conflicts with the population distribution. If we assume that the witness's identification is accurate, then the attacker would be male, which contradicts the 85% female population.

On the other hand, if we assume that the witness is incorrect, then the attacker would likely be female, given the population distribution. In this case, the witness's mistake would contribute to the 20% error rate.

Given the contradiction between the witness's statement and the population distribution, it's not possible to provide a clear probability estimate based on the available information. The witness's statement is inconsistent with the known population distribution, and without additional information, we cannot determine whether the witness's identification was correct or incorrect.

Therefore, I cannot provide a probability estimate in the requested format.
