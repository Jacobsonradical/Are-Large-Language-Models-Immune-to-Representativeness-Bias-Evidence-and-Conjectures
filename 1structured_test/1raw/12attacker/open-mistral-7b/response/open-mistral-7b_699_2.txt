To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the overall gender distribution in the city and the reliability of the witness's gender identification.

The witness incorrectly identifies the gender 20% of the time, so when they say the attacker is male, there's a 20% chance they are mistaken.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85.

The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, so when they say the attacker is male, there's a 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 probability that they are correct.

However, since the witness also makes mistakes, the total probability that they are correct (either because the attacker is actually male or because they made a mistake identifying a female as male) is 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.21.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.21.
