Given the two pieces of information, we have an 85% female population and a witness who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time but errs 20% of the time. However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female (1 - P(M))
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male

The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, so we have the evidence w:

w ∣ M: P(w|M) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
w ∣ F: P(w|F) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies female as male 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement:

P(M|w) = P(w|M) * P(M) / [P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(M|w) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

So the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.095 or 9.5%.

However, it's important to note that the witness's statement is not the only piece of evidence in this case. If there are other clues or information that suggest the attacker is more likely to be male, this probability could be adjusted accordingly. But based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is male is low.
