To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. According to the population distribution, the probability of a random person being male is 15% (0.15).
2. However, the witness's accuracy suggests that in 80% of cases, they correctly identify a male, and in 20% of cases, they incorrectly identify a male as female. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, we need to consider this error rate.
3. To account for the witness's error, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error in this specific case. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, the error must have occurred when the attacker was actually female.
4. Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85.
5. Therefore, the probability of the witness making an error and incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.20 (the error rate).
6. Since we know the witness made an error in this case, we can calculate the probability of this error happening by multiplying the probability of the attacker being female (0.85) by the error rate (0.20): 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17
7. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 1 - the error rate = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80
8. Since we know the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, the probability of this happening when the attacker is actually male is the probability of the witness being correct, which is 0.80.
9. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male is the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male, which is 0.80.

In summary: {probability: 0.80}
