To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided about the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female:

1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of the attacker being female in the city is 0.85. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is:

0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male:

0.8 * 0.17 + 1 * 0.2 = 0.14 + 0.2 = 0.34

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.34, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
