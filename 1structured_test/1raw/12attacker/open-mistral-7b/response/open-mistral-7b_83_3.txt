Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, we also know that the witness, who identified the attacker as male, has a 80% success rate in identifying gender and a 20% error rate.
3. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male 20% of the time, we can infer that they might have mistakenly identified a female as male.
4. Therefore, the actual proportion of male attackers in the city could be higher than 15% due to the witness's errors.
5. To estimate this probability, we can calculate the proportion of male attackers that would result in the witness correctly identifying them as male 80% of the time.
6. Let x be the probability that a male is the attacker. Then, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker is 0.8x.
7. The probability that the witness makes an error (misidentifies a female as male) is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03, or 3%.
8. Since the witness makes errors in identifying both males and females, the actual proportion of male attackers is higher than 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.
9. To find this proportion, we can set up an equation and solve for x: 0.12 = 0.8 * x - 0.03
10. Solving for x, we get x â‰ˆ 0.16 or 16%.

So, based on the witness's ability to judge gender and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 16%. This estimate takes into account the possibility that the witness erred in identifying the attacker's gender.
