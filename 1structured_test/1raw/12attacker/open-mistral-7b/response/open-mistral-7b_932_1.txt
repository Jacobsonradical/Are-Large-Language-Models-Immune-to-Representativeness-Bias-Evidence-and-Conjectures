To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's gender identification.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(wM|M) as the probability that a male attacker is correctly identified by the witness
- P(wM|F) as the probability that a female attacker is incorrectly identified as male by the witness

We are given that:
- P(wM) = P(wM|M) * P(M) + P(wM|F) * P(F)
- P(wM) = 0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * P(F)
- P(M) + P(F) = 1
- P(M) = 0.15 (from information b)

We are also given that P(wM|M) = 0.8 and P(wM|F) = 0.2.

Now we need to find P(F). We can do this by solving the equation for P(M) in the first equation, and then subtracting P(M) from 1 to get P(F).

P(M) = (P(wM) - P(wM|F) * P(F)) / P(wM|M)
P(F) = 1 - P(M)

Now we can calculate P(wM|M) * P(M) + P(wM|F) * P(F) to get P(wM):

P(wM) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)
P(wM) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(wM) = 0.26

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male:

P(M) = P(wM|M) * P(M) / P(wM)
P(M) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.26
P(M) â‰ˆ 0.273

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.273 or 27.3%.
