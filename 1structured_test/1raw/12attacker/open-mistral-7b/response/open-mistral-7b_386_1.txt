To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as follows:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is the number of times the witness correctly identifies a male divided by the total number of times the witness makes a gender identification.
2. In this case, the number of times the witness correctly identifies a male is the probability of a male times the witness's accuracy in identifying males, and the number of times the witness makes a gender identification is the total number of people.
3. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is (proportion of males in the city) * (witness's accuracy in identifying males) = (0.15) * (0.8) = 0.12 or 12%.

However, since the attacker's gender is unknown, we should consider both the possibility that the attacker is male and the possibility that the attacker is female. Given that the witness mistakenly identified a person as male 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male as follows:

1. The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male is the number of times the witness mistakenly identifies a female divided by the total number of times the witness makes a gender identification.
2. In this case, the number of times the witness mistakenly identifies a female is the probability of a female times the witness's error rate in identifying females, and the number of times the witness makes a gender identification is the total number of people.
3. Therefore, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male is (proportion of females in the city) * (witness's error rate in identifying females) = (0.85) * (0.2) = 0.17 or 17%.

Now, since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male as the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male:

1. Probability of attacker being male = Probability of witness correctly identifying a male + Probability of witness mistakenly identifying a female as male.
2. Probability of attacker being male = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 29%.
