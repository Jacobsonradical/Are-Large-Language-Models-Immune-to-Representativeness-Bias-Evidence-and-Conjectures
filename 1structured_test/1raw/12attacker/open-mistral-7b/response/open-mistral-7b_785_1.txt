To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the witness's reliability in determining gender.

1. The population statistics give us that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's reliability is given as correctly identifying gender 80% of the time and erring in 20% of the cases.

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, we can assume that they will incorrectly identify a female as male 20% of the time. This means that when the witness identifies a person as male, there is a 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 or 80% chance that the person is actually male.

However, we can't directly apply this 80% probability to the general population statistics, because we don't know if the witness saw a male or a female. If the witness saw a female, they would incorrectly identify her as male 20% of the time, and if they saw a male, they would correctly identify him 80% of the time.

So, to estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to account for both the general population statistics and the witness's reliability.

The witness identifies the attacker as male. Given the general population statistics, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is male. However, since the witness is reliable 80% of the time, we can adjust this probability based on the witness's observation.

The probability that the witness correctly identified a male is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%. The probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female as male is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

However, since the witness's reliability is based on a sample of people that is half female and half male, it may not accurately reflect the reliability in a city where 85% of the population is female. Therefore, this estimate should be considered as an approximation.
