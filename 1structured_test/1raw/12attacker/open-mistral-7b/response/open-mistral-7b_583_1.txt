To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the city's gender distribution and the witness's ability to accurately identify gender.

1. The city's gender distribution: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify gender: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

A) The attacker is actually male: In this case, the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender. The probability of this scenario is 15%, as that is the proportion of males in the city.

B) The attacker is actually female: In this case, the witness mistakenly identified a female as male. The probability of this scenario is 1 - 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a female) = 0.2 (20%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of scenario A happening is higher than scenario B. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.15}

So, the attacker has an estimated 15% probability of being male, based on the city's gender distribution and the witness's accuracy.
