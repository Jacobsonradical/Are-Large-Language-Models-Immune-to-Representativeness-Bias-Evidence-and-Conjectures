Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. According to the first piece of information, the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The second piece of information tells us that a witness, who is generally correct in identifying gender 80% of the time, identified the attacker as male. However, we also know that the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time.
3. Since we don't have any additional information about whether the witness made an error in this specific case, we can't definitively say that the attacker is male or female based on the witness's testimony alone.

However, if we were to make an estimate given the gender distribution in the city, it would be more likely for the attacker to be female due to the city's population composition. Therefore, without more information, it would be reasonable to assign a lower probability to the attacker being male.

Now, let's calculate a probability based on this reasoning:

The city's population is 85% female, so there's an 85% chance that the attacker is female. If the witness is wrong 20% of the time, there's a 20% chance that they mistakenly identified a female as male, which would increase the estimated probability of the attacker being male.

Since we don't have enough information to calculate the exact probability of the witness being wrong in this specific case, we can't provide a precise probability. Therefore, while it's somewhat more likely that the attacker is female based on the city's population, we can't provide a strict probability estimate.

In conclusion, while we can speculate based on the given information, we cannot definitively determine the probability that the attacker is male without more information. Therefore, it's not possible to provide a probability between 0 and 1 based on the information provided.
