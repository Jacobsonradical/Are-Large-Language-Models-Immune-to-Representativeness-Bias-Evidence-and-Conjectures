The probability estimate of the attacker being male, given the information provided, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the attribution of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being male is given by the population distribution:

P(Male) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male)

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is indeed male, is given by the witness's accuracy in gender identification:

P(Male|Witness) = 0.8 (given that the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time)

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female, is given by the error rate in gender identification:

P(Male|Not Male, Witness) = 0.2 (given that the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

We can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony using Bayes' theorem:

P(Male|Witness) = P(Witness|Male) * P(Male) / [P(Witness|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness|Not Male, Male) * P(Not Male)]

Plugging in the values:

P(Male|Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * (1 - 0.15))]

P(Male|Witness) â‰ˆ 0.19

So, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 19%.
