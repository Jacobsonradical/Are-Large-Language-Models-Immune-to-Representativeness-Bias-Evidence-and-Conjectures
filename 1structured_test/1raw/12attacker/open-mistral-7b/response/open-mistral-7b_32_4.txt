To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of choosing a random person from the city and identifying them as male is 15%. However, the witness's ability to accurately identify gender is better than this, as they correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male. If we consider the actual gender distribution in the city, the probability that a random person is misidentified as male by this witness is 20%. However, since the witness is better than random, we should adjust this probability to account for their higher accuracy rate.

The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as male when that person is actually female can be calculated as follows:

Probability of error when identifying female as male = Probability of choosing a female * Probability of misidentifying a female as male
                                                                      = 0.85 * 0.2
                                                                      = 0.17

Since the witness is equally likely to err when identifying a male as female, the probability of error when identifying a male as female is also 0.17.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability that the witness would correctly identify a male, which is 0.83.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.83}
