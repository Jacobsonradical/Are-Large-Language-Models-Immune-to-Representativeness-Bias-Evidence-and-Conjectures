Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume the attacker's gender is unknown and denote it as X. The probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker's gender as male (when the attacker is female) is the error rate of 20%. So, P(misidentify|female) = 0.2.

On the other hand, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender as male (when the attacker is male) is the witness's accuracy rate of 80%. So, P(correct|male) = 0.8.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we're interested in the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(male|witness) = P(witness|male) * P(male) / [P(witness|male) * P(male) + P(witness|female) * P(female)]

We already have the values for P(witness|male) = 0.8, P(male) = 0.15, P(witness|female) = 0.2, and P(female) = 0.85.

Calculating the probability:

P(male|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

The estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.22, or 22%.
