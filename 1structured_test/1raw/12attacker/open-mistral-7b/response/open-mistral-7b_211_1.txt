Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is accurate in identifying gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.

The witness's statement about the attacker's gender is either correct (the attacker is indeed male) or incorrect (the attacker is actually female).

Since we don't have any additional information to decide if the witness's statement is correct or not, we can't definitively say that the attacker is male. However, we do know the probability of the witness making a mistake in identifying the gender.

The probability of the witness erring and saying the attacker is male when the attacker is actually female is 20%. This is because the witness is wrong 20% of the time.

Since we don't know if the witness is correct or not, we can consider both possibilities: the attacker is male, and the witness is correct (probability 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%), or the attacker is female, and the witness is wrong (probability 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17, or 17%).

Adding these two probabilities together, we get 12% + 17% = 29%. However, this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to identify gender is independent of the actual gender of the attacker, which may not be the case.

Therefore, given the information provided, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. The information about the city's population and the witness's accuracy does not provide enough evidence to make a probabilistic judgment about the gender of the attacker.
