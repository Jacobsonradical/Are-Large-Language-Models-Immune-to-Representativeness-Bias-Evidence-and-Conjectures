Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness, with an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume that the attacker's gender is either 'male' or 'female'. The witness's error rate is 20%, so when they say 'male', they are actually referring to a female 20% of the time.

The probability of the witness misidentifying a female as male is equal to the probability of misidentifying a male as female, given their 80% accuracy rate. Therefore, the error rate for each gender is 20% or 0.2.

Now, let's consider the city's population statistics. In this city, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male. The witness identifies a person as 'male'. Given the city's population, this 'male' could be either a true male (15%) or a misidentified female (15% * 0.2 = 3%).

Hence, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the true male population (15%) and the misidentified female population (3%):

{probability: 0.18, the attacker is likely 18% male}
