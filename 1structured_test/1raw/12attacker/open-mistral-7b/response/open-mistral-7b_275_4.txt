To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. According to the given population statistics, there is an 85% chance that the attacker is female (since 85% of the city's population is female) and a 15% chance that the attacker is male.

2. However, the witness's testimony suggests that there might be a higher probability of the attacker being male. The witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time, and erred 20% of the time.

Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, there is a 20% chance that the witness made an error. Since the population statistics favor a female attacker, it's more likely that the witness made an error in this case. Therefore, the probability that the witness's testimony is incorrect and the attacker is actually female is 0.20.

On the other hand, there is a 0.80 chance that the witness's testimony is correct and the attacker is male.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is 0.80 - 0.20 = {probability: 0.60} or 60%.
