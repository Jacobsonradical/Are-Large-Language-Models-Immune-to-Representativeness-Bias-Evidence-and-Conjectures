Given the information provided, we have two sources of probability estimates: the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. From the population distribution, we know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male. This would suggest a 15% probability that the attacker is male, as the attacker's gender is not necessarily reflective of the city's gender distribution.

2. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is more relevant to this situation. In 80% of the cases, the witness correctly identifies a person's gender, and in 20% of the cases, the witness makes an error. However, we don't know the specific error rate for misidentifying a male as a female in this situation. Let's assume for now that the error rate is equal for both genders, meaning the witness errs in identifying males as females 20% of the time and errs in identifying females as males 20% of the time.

3. The witness identified the attacker as male. If the witness's gender identification was perfectly accurate, we would have a 100% probability that the attacker is male. However, since the witness is not perfectly accurate, we need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error and misidentified a female as male.

4. If the witness misidentified a female as male, the actual gender of the attacker would be female. In this case, the probability of the witness's identification being correct would be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, which is 0.8.

5. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being female given the witness's identification is 0.2 (the probability of the witness making an error).

6. However, we are asked for the probability of the attacker being male, not the probability of the attacker being female. Since the probability of the attacker being female and the probability of the attacker being male add up to 1 (given that the attacker must be either male or female), we can find the probability of the attacker being male by subtracting the probability of the attacker being female from 1.

7. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

So, based on the witness's accuracy in gender identification, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 80%. However, this estimate is subject to the assumption that the error rate for misidentifying a male as a female is equal to the error rate for misidentifying a female as a male, which may not be the case in reality.
