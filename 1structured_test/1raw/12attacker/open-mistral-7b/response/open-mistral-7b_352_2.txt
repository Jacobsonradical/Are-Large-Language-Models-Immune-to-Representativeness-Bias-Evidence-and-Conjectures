Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population demographics and the witness's gender identification accuracy.

1. From the population demographics, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's ability to judge gender correctly is 80% of the time, while they err 20% of the time. However, we don't know whether the witness's errors are more likely to be mistakenly identifying males as females or vice versa.

Given that we don't have enough specific information about the witness's bias or error distribution, we can't reliably adjust the population demographics based on the witness's errors. Therefore, the best estimate of the attacker's gender is still based on the population demographics:

{probability: 0.15, this is the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the city's demographics}
