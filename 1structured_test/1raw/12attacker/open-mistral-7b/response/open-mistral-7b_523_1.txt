To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80%, with an error rate of 20%.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To calculate the probability that the witness identified a male attacker correctly, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Attacker is Male) = P(Attacker is Male | Male identified) * P(Male identified) / P(Attacker is Male) * P(Male identified | All possible genders)

First, let's find P(Male identified | Attacker is Male) and P(Male identified | All possible genders):

1. P(Male identified | Attacker is Male) = 1 (since the attacker is actually male)
2. P(Male identified | All possible genders) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying males)

Now, let's calculate P(Attacker is Male | Male identified):

P(Attacker is Male | Male identified) = P(Male identified | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male) / P(Male identified)

P(Male identified | Attacker is Male) is 1, so:

P(Attacker is Male | Male identified) = (1 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85)

Calculating this expression gives us:

P(Attacker is Male | Male identified) = 0.1 / (0.12 + 0.68) = 0.1 / 0.8 = 0.125

Now, we can calculate the final probability:

P(Male | Attacker is Male) = P(Attacker is Male | Male identified) * P(Male identified) / P(Attacker is Male) * P(Male identified | All possible genders)

P(Male | Attacker is Male) = (0.125) * (0.8) / (0.1) * (0.8) = 0.64

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.64, or 64%.
