To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- F as the probability that the attacker is female
- M as the probability that the attacker is male

The witness's gender identification accuracy can be represented by the following equation:

0.8 * M + 0.2 * F = 1 (witness's observed gender distribution)

We also know that 85% of the population is female, so F = 0.85. Substituting F into the equation above, we get:

0.8 * M + 0.2 * 0.85 = 1
0.64M + 0.17 = 1
0.64M = 0.83
M = 0.83 / 0.64 â‰ˆ 1.302

However, it's important to note that the probability of an attacker being male should be between 0 and 1. The result (1.302) is greater than 1, which means that the witness's accuracy is not enough to conclude that the attacker is more likely male. The witness's observations might be influenced by bias, and a more accurate assessment is needed.

Since the obtained probability is not reliable, it's not possible to provide a strict probability estimate in the requested format. However, the witness's observed gender distribution might suggest that the attacker is more likely male, but further investigation is needed to validate this claim.
