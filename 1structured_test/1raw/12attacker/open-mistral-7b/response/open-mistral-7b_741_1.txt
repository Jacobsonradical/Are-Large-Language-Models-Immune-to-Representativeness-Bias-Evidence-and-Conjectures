To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the overall gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's gender identification accuracy is 80%, and the attacker's gender is unknown. However, we do know that the attacker is more likely to be female (85%) based on the city's gender distribution.
2. Given this information, it's reasonable to assume that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker as male. So, the probability that the attacker is actually female (given the witness's mistake) is 0.8 (witness's error rate) * 0.15 (probability of a male in the city).
3. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male (given the witness's mistake) is 1 - 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.16.
4. However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender. In this case, the attacker is indeed male. So, the probability of this happening is 0.2 (witness's error rate) * 0.15 (probability of a male in the city) = 0.03.
5. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is male (considering both the witness's correct and incorrect identifications) is 0.16 (error rate * male population probability) + 0.03 (correct identification probability) = 0.19.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.19 or 19%.
