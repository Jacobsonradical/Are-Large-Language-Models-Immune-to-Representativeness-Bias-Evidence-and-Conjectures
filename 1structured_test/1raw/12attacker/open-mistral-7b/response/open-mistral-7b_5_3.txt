To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. From the population statistics (information "a"), we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, we also have information "b" that the witness's ability to judge gender was 80% accurate and 20% inaccurate. This means that, in general, the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male 20% of the time and a male as female 20% of the time.
3. Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, it could mean that the attacker is indeed male, or it could be a mistake made by the witness.
4. To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which describes the probability of an event A given another event B. In this case, A is the event "attacker is male," and B is the event "witness identifies attacker as male."
5. Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
6. We know P(A) from the population statistics (85% female, 15% male). P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, which is 1 (since the attacker is actually male in this case).
7. However, we do not have direct access to P(B), which is the probability that the witness identifies any person as male, because we only know the probability of correct identification for males and females separately.
8. To estimate P(B), we can use the witness's overall accuracy in gender identification (80%). Since the population is half male and half female, the probability of encountering a male is 0.5. So, we can estimate P(B) as 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4.
9. Now we can estimate P(A|B) as P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), which is (1) * (0.15) / (0.4) = 0.375.

Therefore, based on the population statistics and the witness's accuracy in gender identification, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.375 or 37.5%.
