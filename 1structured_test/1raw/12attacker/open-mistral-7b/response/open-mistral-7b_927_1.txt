To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability.

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. This means that the probability of a random person being female is 0.85 and the probability of a random person being male is 0.15.

2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. This means that when presented with a person, the witness will correctly identify their gender as male 80% of the time and mistakenly identify a female as male 20% of the time.

3. However, we don't have enough information to know whether the witness's error rate is the same when identifying males as females or vice versa. If it is, then the witness's statement that the attacker is male has a probability of being true equal to the probability that the attacker is male in the population, which is 0.15.

4. If the witness's error rate is different for males and females, then we would need more information to accurately estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

In the absence of more information, our best estimate is that the attacker is male with a probability of 0.15 (15%).
