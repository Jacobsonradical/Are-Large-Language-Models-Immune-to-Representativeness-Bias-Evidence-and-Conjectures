Given the two pieces of information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The general population statistics: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender: 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

The witness's statement that the attacker is male has an inherent probability of being correct, given the general population statistics. However, we also know that the witness sometimes makes mistakes, so we need to account for their error rate as well.

Let P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female, and P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male. We have P(F) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15.

The witness correctly identifies the attacker as male with probability P(M), and incorrectly identifies a female as male with probability P(F) * (1 - 0.8) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (either correctly or incorrectly) is P(M) + 0.03.

According to the witness's statement, this probability is 0.8, so we can set up the equation:

0.8 = P(M) + 0.03

Solving for P(M), we get:

P(M) = 0.77

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.77, or 77%.
