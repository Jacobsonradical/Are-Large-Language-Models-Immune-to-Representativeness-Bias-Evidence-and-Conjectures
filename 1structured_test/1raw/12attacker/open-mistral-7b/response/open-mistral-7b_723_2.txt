To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male, we should consider this as an error. Therefore, the probability that the witness's error was due to misidentifying a female as male is 20%.

The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's error, is equal to the proportion of males in the city.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is: {probability: 0.15}
