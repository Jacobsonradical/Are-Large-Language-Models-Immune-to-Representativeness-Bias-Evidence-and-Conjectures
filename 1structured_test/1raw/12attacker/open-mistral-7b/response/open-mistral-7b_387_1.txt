Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and their error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's reason through it:

The witness's error rate of 20% means that they mistakenly identify a person as male 20% of the time when that person is actually female. Since the population is 85% female, the proportion of times the witness errs by identifying a female as male is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

On the other hand, when the witness correctly identifies a person as male, they are actually identifying a male. Since the population is 15% male, the proportion of times the witness correctly identifies a male is 0.15.

Since the witness's error rate is lower than their correct rate, we can assume that their observations of the attacker are more likely to be correct than their mistakes. Therefore, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is male to be the proportion of times the witness correctly identifies a male, which is 0.15.

In dictionary format: {probability: 0.15}
