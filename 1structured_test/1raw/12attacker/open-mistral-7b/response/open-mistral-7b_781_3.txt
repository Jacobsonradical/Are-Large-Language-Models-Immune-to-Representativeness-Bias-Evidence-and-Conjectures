According to the given information, the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. Since the attacker's gender is not known, there's a 20% chance that the witness's mistake applies to this case. This means there's an 80% chance that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender.

However, we don't have enough information about the gender distribution in the specific area where the attack occurred or at the time of the attack. The city's gender population distribution (85% female, 15% male) is not directly applicable here.

Therefore, I cannot provide a precise probability estimate based on the given information. The probability would depend on the gender distribution in the specific area and time of the attack, which is not provided.
