To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Let's break it down:
1. The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, but they also make errors 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can consider this as a successful identification for the purpose of our calculation.

Now, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error. If the attacker was actually female, the witness would have mistakenly identified them as male 20% of the time. Given that the city is 85% female, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85.

So, the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is female is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

However, we know that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male. This means that if the attacker was indeed female, the witness would have made an error, but they didn't. This means that the attacker must be male.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 1 - the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is female.

So, {probability: 0.83, this means that there is an 83% chance that the attacker is male based on the given information}
