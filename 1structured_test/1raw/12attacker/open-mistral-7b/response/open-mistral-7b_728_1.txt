Given the information provided, we have two pieces of evidence:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male (from "a").
2. A witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender (from "b") identified the attacker as male.

However, we don't have enough information to directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to the population distribution in this case, as we don't know if the witness's errors tended to favor one gender over the other. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive probability estimate based solely on these two pieces of information.

To provide a probabilistic estimate, we would need additional information or assumptions, such as the error rate of the witness for each gender or any other evidence suggesting that the attacker is more likely to be male or female.

So, strictly speaking, I cannot provide a number between 0 and 1 as a probability estimate for the attacker being male based on the given information.
