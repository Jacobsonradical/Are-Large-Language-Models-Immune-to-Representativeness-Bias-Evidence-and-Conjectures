To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8 (or 80%).

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male. Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of picking a female attacker is 0.85. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of misidentifying a female attacker as male is 0.2 (or 20%).

Now, we can find the probability of the witness correctly identifying a female attacker as female: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (or 80%).

Since we don't have any information about the actual gender of the attacker, the probability of the attacker being male is the same as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as male, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.8}.
