To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's gender is unknown, the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as male when the attacker is actually female is 20%.

On the other hand, given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 (or 15%).

However, we also need to consider the possibility of the witness's error. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male when the attacker is actually male is the error rate of 0.20 (or 20%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability that the witness was correct, which is the product of the correct identification rate and the probability that the attacker is male, or 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).

However, we also need to account for the possibility of the witness's error. The probability that the attacker is actually female but the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male is the product of the error rate and the probability that the attacker is female, or 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is male (either correctly identified or mistakenly identified) is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (or 29%).

In summary: {probability: 0.29, the attacker is male with a probability of 29%}
