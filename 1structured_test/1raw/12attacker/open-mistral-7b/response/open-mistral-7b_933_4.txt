To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's gender is randomly selected from the city's population, then the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as male (when the attacker is actually female) is equal to the error rate of 20%.

However, because the city has a 85% female and 15% male population, the actual probability that the attacker is male is not the same as the error rate. To find this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Witness) = P(Witness | Male) * P(Male) / P(Witness)

where:
- P(Male | Witness) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement,
- P(Witness | Male) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is equal to 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy),
- P(Male) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is equal to 0.15 (from the city's gender distribution),
- P(Witness) is the probability of the witness's statement, which is the sum of P(Witness | Male) * P(Male) and P(Witness | Female) * P(Female). Since we don't have the accuracy of the witness in identifying females, we cannot directly calculate P(Witness).

We can, however, use the fact that the witness's statements are equally likely to be true or false, so P(Witness) = 0.5. Then:

P(Male | Witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.5 = 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.24 or 24%.
