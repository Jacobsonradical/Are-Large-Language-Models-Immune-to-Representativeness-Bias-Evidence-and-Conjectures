Given the two pieces of information, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male (from information "a").
2. A witness, who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time (from information "b"), identified the attacker as male.

Now, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's gender. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, there's a 20% chance that the attacker is actually female, but the witness misidentified them as male.

However, we also need to consider the fact that the city's population is heavily female (85%). If the attacker was indeed female but the witness made an error, this would be an unlikely event given the city's demographics.

To account for both factors, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is usually written as P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)], where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male),
- E is the evidence (witness identified attacker as male),
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence,
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time),
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of attacker being male before the evidence),
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness could have identified either gender).

We are given the values of P(E|H) = 0.8 and P(H) = 0.15 (from information "a" and "b"), but we need to estimate P(E) and P(E|~H) (where ~H represents the hypothesis that the attacker is female).

P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying any person as male, which is equal to the sum of the probability of correctly identifying a male (0.8 * 0.15) and the probability of incorrectly identifying a female as male (0.2 * 0.85).

P(E|~H) is the probability of the witness identifying a female as male, which is 0.2 (from the information that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time).

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = [(0.8 * 0.15) / (0.12 + 0.03)] = 0.54

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the evidence and city demographics, is 54%.
