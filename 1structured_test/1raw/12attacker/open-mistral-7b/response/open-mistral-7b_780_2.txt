To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory, which allows us to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:

- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male.
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female.
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male.
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male.

The given information allows us to specify these probabilities as follows:

1. P(M) + P(F) = 1 (since the attacker must be either male or female).
2. From the witness's testimony, P(w|M) = 0.8 and P(w|F) = 0.2.
3. The ratio of males to females in the population is 15% : 85%. Since there are twice as many females as males, P(M) = 0.15 and P(F) = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(M|w) = P(w|M) * P(M) / [P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)]

Substituting the values we computed earlier:

P(M|w) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Doing the calculations, we get:

P(M|w) â‰ˆ 0.21

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 21%.
