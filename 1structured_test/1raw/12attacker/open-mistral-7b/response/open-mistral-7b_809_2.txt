Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The population composition in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

However, it's important to note that the witness's statement contradicts the population data. In this case, we can't directly use the population proportions to calculate the probability of the attacker being male, as the witness's testimony suggests a different gender.

The witness's error rate is 20%, meaning they incorrectly identify the gender 20% of the time. Given that they identified the attacker as male, there is a 20% chance that they made an error and the actual attacker is female.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, would be 1 - the error rate:

{probability: 0.8}

However, this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's accuracy is consistent across all situations, which might not be the case. In reality, the actual probability could be higher or lower than 0.8. More information about the witness, their accuracy in similar situations, and any potential biases would be needed to make a more precise estimate.
