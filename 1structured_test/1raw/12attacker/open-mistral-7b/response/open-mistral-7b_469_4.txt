To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(Correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the gender
- P(Error|M) as the probability that the witness errs when the attacker is male
- P(Error|F) as the probability that the witness errs when the attacker is female

From the information given, we know that:
1) P(M) + P(F) = 1
2) P(Correct) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy)
3) P(Error|M) = 0.2 (witness's error rate when the attacker is male)
4) P(F) = 0.85 (from the city's population distribution)

We don't have enough information to directly calculate P(M), but we can express it in terms of P(F). From the first and fourth equations, we have:
P(M) = 1 - P(F) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now we have enough information to calculate P(Correct|M) and P(Correct|F):
P(Correct|M) = P(Correct and M) / P(M) = (0.8 * P(M)) / 0.8 = P(M) = 0.15
P(Correct|F) = P(Correct and F) / P(F) = (0.8 * P(F)) / 0.8 = P(F) = 0.85

Since the witness identified the attacker as male and was correct, we can also say that the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male is equal to the probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15.

Given that the witness was correct, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male:
P(M|Correct) = P(Correct and M) / P(Correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.15

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15, or 15%.
