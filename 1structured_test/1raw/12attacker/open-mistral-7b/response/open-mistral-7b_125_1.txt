To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given about the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male).

The witness incorrectly identifies the gender 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a male, they misidentify him as female 20% of the time. Similarly, when the witness sees a female, they misidentify her as male 20% of the time.

Since the city has an 85% female population, the probability of seeing a female is 0.85. The probability of seeing a male is therefore 0.15.

The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a female, they correctly identify her as such 80% of the time, and when they see a male, they correctly identify him as such 80% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as male. Given this, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the probability that, when the witness sees a male, they correctly identify him as such. This probability is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time).

However, we must account for the fact that the witness is more likely to see a female in the city (given that 85% of the population is female). Therefore, we should adjust the probability of the attacker being male by the probability that the witness sees a male, multiplied by the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male.

The probability of the witness seeing a male is 0.15. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8. Therefore, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, given that they see a male, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12.
