Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as follows:

1. The population statistics suggest that 15% of the city's population is male.
2. However, a witness identified the attacker as male, but their accuracy in gender identification is only 80%.
3. Therefore, the witness's identification of the attacker as male is not enough evidence to conclusively say that the attacker is male.
4. To estimate the probability, we need to account for the witness's error rate.
5. Since we don't know the exact number of mistakes the witness made in identifying the gender, we can't provide an exact probability.
6. However, we can use the Bayes' theorem to calculate an approximate probability.
7. Let's assume that the witness made a mistake in identifying the gender of the attacker (i.e., they identified a female as male).
8. In this case, the actual attacker is female, and the witness's statement contradicts the reality.
9. The probability of this happening is the probability of the witness making a mistake times the probability of the attacker being female.
10. According to the information provided, the probability of the witness making a mistake is 20%, and the probability of the attacker being female is 85%.
11. Therefore, the probability of both events happening (i.e., the witness making a mistake and the attacker being female) is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).
12. Since we don't know if the witness made a mistake or not, we should also consider the scenario where the witness did not make a mistake (i.e., the attacker is actually male).
13. The probability of this happening is the probability of the witness not making a mistake times the probability of the attacker being male.
14. According to the information provided, the probability of the witness not making a mistake is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (or 80%), and the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.
15. Therefore, the probability of both events happening (i.e., the witness not making a mistake and the attacker being male) is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).
16. Since we don't know which scenario is true, we should consider both scenarios as possible outcomes.
17. Therefore, the overall probability of the attacker being male is the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios: 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29 (or 29%).

Therefore, based on the given information and assumptions, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 29%.
