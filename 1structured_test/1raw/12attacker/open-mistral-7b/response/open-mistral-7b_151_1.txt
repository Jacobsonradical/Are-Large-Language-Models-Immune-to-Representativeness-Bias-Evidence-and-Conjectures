To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have information about whether the witness's errors lean more towards misidentifying males as females or vice versa, we'll assume that the errors are evenly distributed. This means that when the witness makes an error, they are just as likely to mistake a male for a female as they are to mistake a female for a male.

Given that the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as follows:

Probability of correctly identifying a male = Witness's accuracy rate for males
                                                             = 0.8

Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time, the probability of the witness making an error when they encounter a male is:

Probability of error for males = 1 - Witness's accuracy rate for males
                                             = 1 - 0.8
                                             = 0.2

Now, since we assume that the errors are evenly distributed, the probability of the witness erring by misidentifying a male as female is equal to the probability of the witness erring by misidentifying a female as male:

Probability of misidentifying a male as female = 0.2

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, plus the probability of the witness making an error but still correctly identifying the attacker as male:

Probability that the attacker is male = Probability of correctly identifying a male + Probability of misidentifying a female as male
                                                      = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.15
                                                      = 0.8 + 0.025
                                                      = 0.825

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.825 or 82.5%.
