Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male based on the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's errors are more likely to be in favor of misidentifying males as females or females as males. Let's assume for simplicity that the error rate is evenly distributed between the two genders.

The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male. If we assume that the error rate is the same for both genders, then the probability that the witness identifies a male attacker as male is 0.8 (the correct identification rate) times 0.15 (the proportion of males in the population), or 0.12.

On the other hand, the probability that the witness identifies a female attacker as female is 0.8 (the correct identification rate) times 0.85 (the proportion of females in the population), or 0.68.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is the probability that the witness correctly identified a male, which is 0.12.

However, given that the error rate is likely not perfectly evenly distributed between the two genders, and considering that the witness's ability to judge gender under the conditions of the attack may have been affected, this estimate should be considered as an approximation.

{probability: 0.12, please note that this is a rough estimate and may not accurately reflect the true probability}
