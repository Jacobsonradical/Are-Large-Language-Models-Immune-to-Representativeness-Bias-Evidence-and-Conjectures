To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of a false positive (misidentifying a female as male) as the error rate:

False positive probability = Error rate = 0.2

The probability of a true positive (correctly identifying a male as male) is the complement of the error rate:

True positive probability = 1 - Error rate = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

However, we know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. This means that the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

To find the posterior probability, we multiply the prior probability by the true positive probability and divide by the sum of the prior probability and the false positive probability:

Posterior probability = (Prior probability * True positive probability) / (Prior probability + False positive probability)

Posterior probability = (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 + 0.2)

Posterior probability = 0.12

So, based on the witness's testimony and the city's gender distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12, or 12%.
