Given the two pieces of information provided, we can approach this problem by considering both the overall population statistics and the witness's reliability.

1. The population statistics suggest that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's reliability is that they correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.
3. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as male contradicts the population statistics.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to account for both the population statistics and the witness's reliability. Since the witness's identification could be an error, we should consider the possibility that the attacker is actually female.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is female as P(female) and the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). We know that P(female) + P(male) = 1.

The witness's identification of the attacker as male has a probability of P(male) if the attacker is indeed male, and a probability of P(error|female) = 0.2 * P(female) if the attacker is female.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can set up an equation:

0.8 * P(male) + 0.2 * P(error|female) = 1

Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we know that P(male) + P(error|female) = 0.8. Therefore, we can simplify the equation to:

P(male) = 0.5

However, this result seems to contradict the population statistics. This is because the witness's identification might be an error. In fact, the witness's identification could be an error with a probability of 0.2.

To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is indeed male, and the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is female (and the witness made an error):

P(identified as male|male) = P(male) = 0.5
P(identified as male|female) = P(error|female) = 0.2 * P(female)

Given the witness's identification, we can calculate the posterior probabilities of the attacker being male or female:

P(male|identified as male) = P(identified as male|male) * P(male) / (P(identified as male|male) * P(male) + P(identified as male|female) * P(error|female))
P(female|identified as male) = P(identified as male|female) * P(error|female) / (P(identified as male|male) * P(male) + P(identified as male|female) * P(error|female))

Calculating these probabilities, we get:

P(male|identified as male) ≈ 0.59
P(female|identified as male) ≈ 0.41

This suggests that, given the witness's identification, the attacker is more likely to be male (with a probability of approximately 0.59), but there is still a significant chance that the attacker is female (with a probability of approximately 0.41).

However, since the population statistics suggest that the attacker is more likely to be female (with a probability of 0.85), we should be cautious about this result. It seems that the witness's identification might be an error, and the true probability of the attacker being male is likely lower than the estimate of 0.59.

In conclusion, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.59, but this estimate is likely an overestimate due to the witness's potential error in gender identification. A more conservative estimate might be around 0.4, given the overall population statistics.

{probability: 0.4, please note that this is a more conservative estimate considering the population statistics}
