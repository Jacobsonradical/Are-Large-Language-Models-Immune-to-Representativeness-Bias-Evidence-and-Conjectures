Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. However, we don't have information about the gender distribution in the specific area where the attack occurred. We only know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.

Since we don't have specific numbers about the gender distribution in the area where the attack occurred, we can't make a precise calculation. But we can make an educated guess based on the given information.

If the attack occurred in an area with a gender distribution similar to the city's population, then the attacker is more likely to be female (85% chance) according to the city's statistics. However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male 20% of the time when they were wrong.

So, if we assume that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between incorrectly identifying males and females, and the attacker is actually female, then there would be an additional 20% chance that the witness erroneously identified the attacker as male.

Therefore, if we add the 15% chance that the attacker is male according to the city's statistics to the 20% chance that the witness incorrectly identified a female as male, we get an estimated probability of 35% that the attacker is male.
