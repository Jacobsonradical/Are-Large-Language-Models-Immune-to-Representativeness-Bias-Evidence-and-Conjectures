Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:
1. The majority of the population in the city is female (85%).
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate at identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

The first piece of information tells us that the population is heavily female, but this does not necessarily mean the attacker is female. The second piece of information tells us that a witness, who is not perfect, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability (the probability before we received new information) with the likelihood of the new information given the prior. In this case, the prior probability is the probability that the attacker is male in the population, and the likelihood is the probability that the witness would identify a male attacker as male.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness would identify a male attacker as male)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is male in the population)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability that the witness identified the attacker as male)

We are given the prior probability of the attacker being male (15%), the likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker as male (80%), and the probability of the witness identifying any attacker as male (the sum of the likelihoods: 80% for male attackers and 20% for female attackers).

However, we do not have the probability of the witness identifying any attacker as male, which is necessary to calculate the probability of B in the Bayes' theorem formula. Without this information, we cannot provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

As a rough approximation, we can say that the probability of the attacker being male is likely higher than 15% (the prior probability), given that the witness identified the attacker as male, but it is unlikely to be higher than 80% (the likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker as male), given that the witness is not perfect. However, without more information, a precise estimate cannot be provided.
