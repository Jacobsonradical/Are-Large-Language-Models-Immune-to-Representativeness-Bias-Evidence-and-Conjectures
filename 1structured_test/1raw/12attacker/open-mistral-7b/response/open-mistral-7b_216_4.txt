To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume that the attacker is actually female. In this case, the witness will mistakenly identify the attacker as male 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85.

So, the probability that the witness misidentifies a female as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Now, let's assume that the attacker is actually male. In this case, the witness will correctly identify the attacker as male 80% of the time. Since 15% of the population is male, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we should assign a higher probability to the scenario where the attacker is indeed male. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12, or 12%.

However, this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to identify gender is independent of the attacker's actual gender. If the witness is biased or makes more errors in certain gender cases, this estimate would not be accurate.

So, the strict answer to your question is: {probability: 0.12} but with the caveat that this estimate may not be fully reliable due to potential biases in the witness's gender identification ability.
