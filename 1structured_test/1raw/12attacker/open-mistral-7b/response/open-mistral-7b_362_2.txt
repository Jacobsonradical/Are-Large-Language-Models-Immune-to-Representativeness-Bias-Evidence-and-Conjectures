To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probabilities based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem is represented as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, we are interested in finding P(Male|Attack), where Male represents the attacker being male and Attack represents the attack.

From the information provided, we have:
- P(Male) = 0.15 (as 85% of the population is female)
- P(Attack|Male) = 1 (since the attacker was male)
- P(Attack|Female) = unknown, but it's assumed to be lower than P(Attack|Male)
- P(Male|Witness) = 0.8 (the witness identified the attacker as male 80% of the time)

We also know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, so we can calculate P(Female|Witness) = 0.2.

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(Attack|Female) directly. But we can use the given information about the witness's accuracy to infer that P(Attack|Female) < P(Attack|Male).

Since we can't calculate P(Attack|Female) directly, we can't compute P(Male|Attack) directly either. Instead, we can find an estimate by assuming a range for P(Attack|Female) and calculating P(Male|Attack) for each value in that range.

One approach is to assume that P(Attack|Female) is half of P(Attack|Male), representing a possible minimum scenario. In this case, P(Male|Attack) would be:

P(Male|Attack) = [P(Attack|Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Attack|Male) * P(Male) + P(Attack|Female) * P(Female)]
P(Male|Attack) = [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.5 * 0.85]
P(Male|Attack) ≈ 0.14

This estimate suggests that the attacker is likely to be male in about 14% of the cases, given the information provided. However, this is a conservative estimate, as there might be scenarios where P(Attack|Female) is significantly lower than 0.5.

To find a more optimistic estimate for the probability that the attacker is male, we could assume that P(Attack|Female) is much lower than P(Attack|Male). For example, we could assume that P(Attack|Female) is 10% of P(Attack|Male), representing a possible maximum scenario. In this case, P(Male|Attack) would be:

P(Male|Attack) = [P(Attack|Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Attack|Male) * P(Male) + P(Attack|Female) * P(Female)]
P(Male|Attack) = [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85]
P(Male|Attack) ≈ 0.26

This estimate suggests that the attacker is likely to be male in about 26% of the cases, given the information provided and assuming a maximum scenario for P(Attack|Female).

In conclusion, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated to be between 14% and 26%, depending on the assumptions made about P(Attack|Female). However, without more information, it's challenging to provide a more precise estimate.
