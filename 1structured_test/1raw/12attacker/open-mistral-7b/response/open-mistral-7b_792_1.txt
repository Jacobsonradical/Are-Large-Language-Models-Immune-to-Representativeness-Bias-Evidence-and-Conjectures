To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an assumption about the reliability of the witness's gender identification under the specific night conditions.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we have a prior probability of the attacker being male. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as male introduces a biased sample that might not accurately reflect the true population distribution.

Since the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, we can assume that there's a 0.8 probability that they correctly identified a male and a 0.2 probability that they incorrectly identified a female as male.

Given the witness's report, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed male. However, we cannot directly use the prior probability of 0.15 (15%) because the witness's identification might not accurately represent the true distribution of gender in the city.

To calculate an adjusted probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is male | Witness's report) = (P(Witness's report | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male)) / (P(Witness's report))

But we lack the necessary information to calculate P(Witness's report), which represents the probability of the witness's report given the true gender distribution in the city. Therefore, we cannot provide a strict probability estimate based on the given information.

In summary, the witness's report of a male attacker increases the probability that the attacker is male, but we cannot determine an exact probability without additional information.
