Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is male
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are given the prior probability of A, which is P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the city's population is male), and the conditional probability of E given A, which is P(E|A) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male in this specific case).

We also have the prior probability of not A, which is P(not A) = P(F) = 0.85 (since 85% of the city's population is female), and the conditional probability of E given not A, which is P(E|not A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is female).

The probability we are interested in is P(A|E), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|E) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.15 / 0.32 = 0.46875

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.47 or 47%.
