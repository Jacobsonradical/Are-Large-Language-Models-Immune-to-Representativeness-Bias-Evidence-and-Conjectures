Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to revise the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

From the provided information, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the gender as male 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the gender as male 20% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is male, as 15% of the population is male)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is female, as 85% of the population is female)

To calculate P(E), we need to use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Computing this value, we get:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.448

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.45 or 45%.
