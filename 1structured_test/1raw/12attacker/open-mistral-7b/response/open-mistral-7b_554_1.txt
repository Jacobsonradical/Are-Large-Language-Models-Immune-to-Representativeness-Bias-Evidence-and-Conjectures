To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given and make an assumption about the witness's error rate when identifying the attacker's gender.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume that the witness's error rate is independent of the actual gender of the person. In this case, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is equal to the probability of incorrectly identifying a female as male (20%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

a) The attacker is indeed male, and the witness correctly identified the gender.
b) The attacker is female, but the witness made an error.

The probability of scenario a) is the probability of a male in the population multiplied by the probability of correctly identifying a male, which is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

The probability of scenario b) is the probability of a female in the population multiplied by the probability of incorrectly identifying a female as male, which is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the probability of scenario a) happening. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.12}
