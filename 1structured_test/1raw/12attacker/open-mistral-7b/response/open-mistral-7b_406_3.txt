Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and errs 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. However, we don't have any information about whether the attacker is a resident of this city or not. If we assume that the attacker is a resident of the city, then the probability of the attacker being male would be the proportion of males in the city, which is 15%.

However, the witness's statement suggests that the witness might not be very reliable in gender identification, especially in low light conditions. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the witness's identification might not accurately reflect the actual gender of the attacker.

Given this uncertainty, a conservative approach would be to use the witness's error rate as a lower bound for the probability that the witness is incorrect, and the population gender distribution as an upper bound for the true gender of the attacker. This would mean that the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's statement, is less than 15% (the actual proportion of males in the city) and greater than 20% (the witness's error rate).

A more quantitative approach would be to calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake, given that the attacker is male. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of the witness being correct that the attacker is male is 0.8, and the probability of the witness being incorrect (i.e., stating that the attacker is female) is 0.2.

Given that the population is 85% female, the probability that the attacker is female, given that the witness is incorrect, is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the population gender distribution, is the probability of the witness being incorrect multiplied by the probability that the attacker is female given the witness's incorrect statement, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.

However, as I mentioned earlier, this assumes that the witness is a reliable gender identifier, which may not be the case. Therefore, this estimate should be interpreted with caution.

Here's the answer in the requested format: {probability: 0.17}
