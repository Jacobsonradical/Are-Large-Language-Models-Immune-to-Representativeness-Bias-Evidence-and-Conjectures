To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. Based on population statistics, the probability of the attacker being male is 15%. This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of males in the population by 1 (since the event happens to one individual out of the total population): 0.15.

2. However, the witness's reliability in gender identification suggests that the actual probability may be different from the population statistics. The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. This means that when the witness identifies a person as male, there is a 20% chance that this person is actually female.

3. To incorporate the witness's reliability into our estimate, we can consider that the witness's identification of the attacker as male could be a mistake 20% of the time. Hence, the true probability of the attacker being male might be lower than the 85% reported by the witness.

4. To calculate this adjusted probability, we need to consider the probability that the witness is correct, which is 1 minus the probability of error: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

5. Now, we can calculate the adjusted probability of the attacker being male by multiplying the population probability by the probability of the witness being correct: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, considering both the population statistics and the witness's reliability, is 0.12 or 12%.
