To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs when new evidence becomes available.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
1. P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
2. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, which is given as 0.8.
3. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to find.
4. P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies anyone as male, which is the sum of the probability of a male being male (P(A)) and the probability of a female being mistakenly identified as male (P(not A) * P(witness mistakes female as male)).

We know that P(not A) = 1 - P(A) and P(witness mistakes female as male) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time).

So, P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(not A) * P(B|not A) = P(A) * 0.8 + (1 - P(A)) * 0.2

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1. P(A) * 0.8 = 0.8 * 0.80 (from the witness's ability)
2. P(A) * 0.8 + (1 - P(A)) * 0.2 = 0.85 (from the city's population)

We can solve these equations to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is male.

Let's solve the first equation for P(A):

P(A) = 0.8 * 0.80 / 0.8 = 0.64

Now, let's substitute this value back into the second equation and solve for P(A):

0.64 * 0.8 + (1 - 0.64) * 0.2 = 0.85
0.512 + 0.2 - 0.64 = 0.85
0.512 = 0.25

This does not make sense, as the left side of the equation must be less than or equal to 0.85, and 0.512 is greater than 0.85. It seems that the information provided is inconsistent, and we cannot accurately estimate the probability of the attacker being male based on the given data.
