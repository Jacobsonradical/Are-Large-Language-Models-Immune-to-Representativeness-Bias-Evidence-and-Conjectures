Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population demographics and the witness's identification of the attacker.

1. According to the population demographics, the probability of the attacker being male is 15%. This is based on the assumption that the attacker is chosen at random from the population.

2. However, the witness identified the attacker as male. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. This means that in 80% of the cases, the witness correctly identifies the gender, and in 20% of the cases, the witness makes an error.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there is a 0.8 (or 80%) chance that the witness was correct. Since we know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, there is also a 0.2 (or 20%) chance that the witness made an error in this case.

If the witness made an error, then the attacker is actually female (given the city's demographics). In this case, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85 (or 85%), and the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (or 15%).

However, we are given that the witness was correct in this case, so the attacker is indeed male.

In summary, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 (or 80%). This is a higher estimate than the population demographics because of the witness's ability to correctly identify genders.

So, {probability: 0.8}
