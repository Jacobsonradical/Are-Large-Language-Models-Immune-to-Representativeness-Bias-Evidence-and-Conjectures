Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80% (correct) and 20% (incorrect).
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A) is the prior probability of event A, P(B) is the prior probability of event B, and P(B|A) is the likelihood of event B given event A.

In this case, event A is the attacker being male, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is given by the population distribution. Since there are 85% females and 15% males, P(A) = 15/100 = 0.15.
2. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male if the attacker is male. This is given by the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8.
3. P(B) is the prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.16
= 0.84375

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.84375 or 84.375%.
