Given the information provided, we have two sources of probability: the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. This gives us a baseline probability that an attacker is male.

2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, since the witness identified the attacker as male, we know that they made a correct identification in this case or erred. Since we don't know which, we can't directly use this probability.

Since we don't have enough information to directly calculate the probability, we can only provide an upper bound. This upper bound is the probability that the attacker is male under the population distribution, which is 0.15 (15%). Even if the witness was wrong, they could still have identified a male attacker, so the actual probability must be at least as high as this value.
