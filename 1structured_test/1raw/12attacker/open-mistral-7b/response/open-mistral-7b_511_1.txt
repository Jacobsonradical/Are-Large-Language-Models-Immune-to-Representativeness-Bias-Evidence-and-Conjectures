Given the information provided, the attacker's gender was initially unknown to the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as male. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, with an error rate of 20%.

In this scenario, we can consider the witness's identification as a piece of evidence. However, we should also consider the possibility of the witness making an error. Since the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of a random person being female is higher than the probability of being male.

Given this, it's reasonable to assume that if the witness made an error, it was more likely to be in favor of the more common gender (female). Therefore, the probability of the witness's identification being incorrect and the attacker being female would be higher than the probability of the identification being correct and the attacker being male.

Let's denote F as the probability of the attacker being female and M as the probability of the attacker being male. We can set up an equation based on the witness's ability to correctly identify gender:

M = 0.8 * M + 0.2 * F

Given that the total probability of the attacker being either male or female is 1, we can also set up an equation for F:

F = 1 - M

Substituting M from the first equation into the second, we get:

F = 1 - 0.8 * M

Now we can solve these equations to find the values of M and F. However, since we are only interested in the probability that the attacker is male, we can simplify this problem by expressing M as a function of F:

M = (1 - F) / (1 + 0.8 * (1 - F))

We cannot find an exact numerical solution for M in this case, but we can still estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time, we can assume that the true probability of the attacker being male is higher than 0.8.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.8, please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions}
