To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between identifying males as females and females as males, then the witness's true error rate for misidentifying males is higher than 10% (since they are mistakenly identifying more females as males than males as females due to the city's gender distribution).

However, without specific information about the exact distribution of the witness's errors, we cannot determine the exact error rate for misidentifying males. So, we will use the 20% error rate as an upper bound for the true error rate in this case.

The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male. If the witness's 20% error rate applies to misidentifying males, then the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is 1 minus the probability that the witness made an error:
