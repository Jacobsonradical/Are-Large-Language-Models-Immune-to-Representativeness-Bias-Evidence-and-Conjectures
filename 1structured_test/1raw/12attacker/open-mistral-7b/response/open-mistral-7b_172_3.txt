To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we first need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't have information on whether the errors are more likely to be misidentifying males as females or females as males. Let's assume for now that the errors are evenly distributed, which means the witness is making 10% errors in each direction.

Given that the city has an 85% female population, we can calculate the probability of a randomly chosen person being female:

P(Female) = 0.85

Since the errors are evenly distributed, the probability of a randomly chosen person being misidentified as male is also 10%.

P(Misidentified as Male) = 0.10

Now, let's consider the witness's statement. If the witness identifies a person as male, the probability of that person being actually male is:

P(Male | Identified as Male) = P(Male) + P(Misidentified as Male | Identified as Male) * P(Misidentified as Male)

P(Male | Identified as Male) = 0.85 + 0.10 * 0.10 = 0.86

However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness could be systematically biased towards identifying people as male. If the witness is more likely to err on the side of misidentifying males as females, then the actual probability of the attacker being male might be lower than 0.86.

Unfortunately, the information provided does not allow us to quantify this bias. Therefore, the best estimate we can give is 0.86, assuming no bias.

{probability: 0.86}
