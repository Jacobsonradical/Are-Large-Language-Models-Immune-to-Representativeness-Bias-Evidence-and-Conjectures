Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence to consider: the gender distribution in the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

1. The city's gender distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's ability to identify gender: correct 80% of the time, incorrect 20% of the time.

However, the witness's error rate is based on a balanced sample of people (half female and half male). But in this case, the attacker's gender is unknown, and we're dealing with an unbalanced sample. If the attacker is actually female, then the witness is more likely to incorrectly identify the attacker as male (since the witness errs more often with female than male).

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- 0.8 as the probability of correctly identifying a male
- 0.2 as the probability of incorrectly identifying a male
- 0.1 as the probability of correctly identifying a female
- 0.9 as the probability of incorrectly identifying a female

Given the information that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can set up an equation:

0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * P(F) = 1 (since the witness is 100% certain)

However, without more information, it's not possible to solve this equation uniquely for P(M). We can't determine the probability that the attacker is male with certainty based on this information.

{probability: 0.5, please note that this is an estimate and not a definitive answer because of the missing information}
