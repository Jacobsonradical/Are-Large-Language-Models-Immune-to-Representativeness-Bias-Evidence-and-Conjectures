To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (the witness's identification)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability that a male would be mistakenly identified as female by the witness)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (without knowing the gender of the attacker)

Given the information provided, we can calculate the values for each term in the formula:

1. P(H) (Prior probability of the attacker being male): We don't have this information directly, but we can use the population statistics provided in "b" as an approximation. The population is 85% female and 15% male, so the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

2. P(E|H) (Likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis): The witness incorrectly identifies the gender 20% of the time when the person is male. So, the probability that a male would be mistakenly identified as female by the witness is 0.2.

3. P(E) (Probability of the evidence): This is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker could be either male or female. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of the evidence is: 0.8 * 0.15 (female attacker) + 0.2 * 0.85 (male attacker) = 0.12 + 0.14 = 0.26

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.2 * 0.15 / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.269

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.269 or 26.9%.
