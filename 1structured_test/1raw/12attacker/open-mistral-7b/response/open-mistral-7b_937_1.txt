Given the two pieces of information, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.

Since we don't know if the witness made an error or not in this case, we can't rely solely on the witness's statement. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the population distribution and the witness's accuracy.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B (P(A|B)) is given by:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is male,
- B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male,
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (given by the population distribution),
- P(B) is the probability of the witness making the statement that the attacker is male (given both that the attacker is male and that the attacker is female),
- P(B|A) is the likelihood that the witness makes the statement given that the attacker is male.

Let's calculate these probabilities:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% chance the attacker is male)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies male 20% of the time)

We can't calculate P(B) directly, but we can write it as a probability sum:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since we don't know the prior probability of the attacker being female (P(not A)), we can't calculate P(B) explicitly. However, we don't need to calculate P(B) to apply Bayes' theorem, we just need to know its relative value to P(B|A) and P(B|not A).

The relative value of P(B) is:

P(B) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Since P(B|not A) is much smaller than P(B|A), we can approximate this value as:

P(B) / (P(B|A) * P(A))

This value gives us the likelihood of the witness making the statement "the attacker is male" given the population distribution, without knowing the exact probability P(B).

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately:

{probability: P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A)) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12}

This means that, given the information we have, there is a 12% chance that the attacker is male and a 88% chance that the attacker is female. However, since we cannot calculate P(B) exactly, this estimate should be taken with caution.
