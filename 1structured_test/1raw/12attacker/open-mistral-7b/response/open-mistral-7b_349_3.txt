To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city population is 85% female and 15% male.

If we assume that the witness's gender identification accuracy is independent of the gender distribution in the city, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification:

P(Male | Witness's Identification) = P(Witness's Identification | Male) * P(Male) / [P(Witness's Identification | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness's Identification | Female) * P(Female)]

Substituting the given values:
P(Male) = 0.15
P(Witness's Identification | Male) = 0.8
P(Witness's Identification | Female) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

Now, calculate the probability:

P(Male | Witness's Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(Male | Witness's Identification) â‰ˆ 0.147

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 14.7%.
