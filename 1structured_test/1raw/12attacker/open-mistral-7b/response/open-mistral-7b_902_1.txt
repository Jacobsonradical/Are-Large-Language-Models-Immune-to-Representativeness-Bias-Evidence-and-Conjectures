To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: According to the given information, 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, it's important to note that the witness's error rate is not specified to be biased towards either gender. If we assume that the witness's errors are random, then the witness's incorrect gender identification could be equally distributed between male and female.

Given this assumption, let's calculate the probability of the witness's incorrect identification being a male:

1. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 20%.
2. Since the population is 85% female, the probability of the witness making an error on a female is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (approximately 17%).
3. Since the population is 15% male, and the witness mistakenly identifies a male as female 20% of the time, the probability of the witness making an error on a male is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (approximately 3%).

Since we don't have enough information to determine if the witness's errors are biased, we cannot definitively say that the probability of the attacker being male is 17% or 3%. As a result, I cannot provide a strict answer in the requested dictionary format.
