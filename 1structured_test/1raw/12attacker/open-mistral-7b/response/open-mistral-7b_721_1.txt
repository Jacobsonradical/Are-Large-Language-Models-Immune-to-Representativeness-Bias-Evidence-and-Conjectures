To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's gender was not visible, we can treat the witness's identification as an error (since they identified the attacker as male). This means the attacker's actual gender is the opposite of what the witness reported.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is equivalent to the probability that the witness errs, which is 20%. However, since the witness errs in favor of identifying males, this means that the actual attacker is more likely to be female given the city's gender distribution.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is male considering the city's gender distribution:

The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male. Since the witness errs in favor of identifying males, we can assume that for every 100 people, the witness errs and identifies a female as male 20 times. This means there are actually 100 - 20 = 80 females in the city for every 100 people.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, we can interpret this as the attacker being one of the 15% male population in the city. So, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 or 15%.

However, as mentioned earlier, the witness's error rate favors identifying males, so the actual probability might be lower. Given the information available, the most conservative estimate would be the 15% probability calculated from the city's gender distribution.
