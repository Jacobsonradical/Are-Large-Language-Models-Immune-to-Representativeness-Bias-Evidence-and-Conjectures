Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in determining gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have direct information about how the witness identified the attacker in this specific case.

The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. If we assume that the witness's gender bias does not affect their judgment in this situation, we could use the population statistics to make an estimate. However, without knowing if the witness's error rate is influenced by the gender ratio in the population, this estimate would be speculative.

In a strictly probabilistic sense, if we assume the witness's error rate is independent of the population gender ratio, and given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male would be the witness's accuracy rate of 80%.

{probability: 0.8}

However, due to the lack of direct evidence about the witness's judgment in this specific case, and the potential influence of bias, this estimate should be considered tentative and subject to revision with more information.
