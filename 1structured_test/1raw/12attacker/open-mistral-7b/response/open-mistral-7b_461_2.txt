Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the city's population demographics and the witness's ability to identify gender.

1. From the city's demographics (information "a"), we know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.

2. The witness's ability to identify gender is given in information "b". They correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

However, we only have one piece of evidence from the witness, and it's not clear if this witness's accuracy applies to the city's demographics. If the witness's accuracy is independent of the city's demographics, then we could simply multiply the two percentages to get an estimate. But if the witness's accuracy is influenced by the city's demographics, then it's not as simple.

Without more information, it's difficult to provide a precise estimate. However, if we assume that the witness's accuracy is independent of the city's demographics, we could say that:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, probability of the attacker being male based on the city's demographics and assuming the witness's accuracy is independent}

But as mentioned, this is an assumption, and without more information, it's impossible to provide a more precise estimate.
