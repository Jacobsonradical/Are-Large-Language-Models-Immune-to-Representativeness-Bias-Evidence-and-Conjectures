Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) (the prior probability): This is the probability that the attacker is male in the population. Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, P(A) = 0.15
- P(B|A) (the likelihood): This is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male. The witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(B|~A) (the likelihood of error): This is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(B|~A) = 0.2
- P(~A) (the prior probability of the opposite event): This is the probability that the attacker is female, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(A|B) = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%.
