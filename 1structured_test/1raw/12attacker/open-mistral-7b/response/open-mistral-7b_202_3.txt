To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness's error rate.

1. The general population distribution: The attacker could be either male (15%) or female (85%).

2. The witness's error rate: The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can't be certain that the person the witness identified as male is actually the attacker, as there's a 20% chance of misidentification. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probability of the attacker being male and the witness being correct, and the probability of the attacker being female and the witness making an error:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29}

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
