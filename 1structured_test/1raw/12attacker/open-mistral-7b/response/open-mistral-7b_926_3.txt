To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the population.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, let's denote the probability of a male attacker as p and the probability of a female attacker as 1-p.

The witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male with a probability of 20%, or 0.2. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that this identification is correct is equal to the probability p of a male attacker multiplied by the probability 0.8 of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, plus the probability (1-p) of a female attacker multiplied by the probability 0.2 of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male.

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is:

p * 0.8 + (1-p) * 0.2 = 0.8p + 0.2(1-p)

We can simplify this equation by setting it equal to the witness's stated probability of 0.8:

0.8p + 0.2(1-p) = 0.8

Now, we can solve for p:

0.8p + 0.2 - 0.2p = 0.8
0.6p = 0.8
p = 0.8 / 0.6 = 4/3 â‰ˆ 0.6667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the gender distribution in the city, is approximately 0.6667 or 66.67%.
