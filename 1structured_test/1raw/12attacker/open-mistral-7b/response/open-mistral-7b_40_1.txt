To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- p: the probability that the attacker is male
- q: the probability that the attacker is female (since there are two genders, p + q = 1)
- T: the true gender of the attacker
- E: the gender the witness identified (male or female)

Given the witness's accuracy, we know that if the attacker is male (T=m), the probability of the witness correctly identifying him as male is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying him as female is 0.2.

Similarly, if the attacker is female (T=f), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying her as male is 0.2, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying her as female is 0.8.

The witness stated that they correctly identified the gender 80% of the time. This means that p * 0.8 + q * 0.2 = 0.8 (since when the attacker is male, the witness correctly identifies it 80% of the time, and when the attacker is female, the witness incorrectly identifies it 20% of the time).

Now, we have two equations with two variables:

1. p + q = 1
2. p * 0.8 + q * 0.2 = 0.8

Let's solve this system of linear equations. We can express p in terms of q:

p = 1 - q

Now, substitute p in the second equation:

(1-q) * 0.8 + q * 0.2 = 0.8

Simplify the equation:

0.8 - 0.2q = 0.8

Now, solve for q:

0.2q = 0

Since q cannot be zero, there is an inconsistency in the given data. The witness's stated accuracy of 80% cannot be reconciled with the population gender distribution of 85% female and 15% male. The witness's statements are not consistent with the available information.

In summary, it is not possible to provide a probability estimate based on the given information due to inconsistencies in the data.
