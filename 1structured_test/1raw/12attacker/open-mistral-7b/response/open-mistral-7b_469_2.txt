To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and is used to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence.

In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ~H) * P(~H)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being male before seeing the evidence)
- P(~H) is the prior probability of the opposite hypothesis (probability of the attacker being female before seeing the evidence)
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (probability that the witness identifies a male as male)
- P(E | ~H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the opposite hypothesis (probability that the witness identifies a female as male)

Let's denote the probabilities:
- P(H) = p_m
- P(~H) = 1 - p_m
- P(E | H) = 0.8
- P(E | ~H) = 0.2

Using the given information, we know that p_m + (1 - p_m) = 1, which means p_m = 0.5 since the gender population is equal.

Plugging the values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H | E) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.85)]

P(H | E) = 0.4 / 0.4 + 0.03

P(H | E) = 0.4 / 0.07

P(H | E) â‰ˆ 0.571

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.571 or 57.1%.
