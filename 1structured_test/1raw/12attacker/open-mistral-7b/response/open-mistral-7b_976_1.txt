Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. But we also have information about a witness who is not always accurate in identifying gender.

2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a person who is actually female, they correctly identify her as female 80% of the time, and when they see a person who is actually male, they correctly identify him as male 80% of the time.

3. However, the witness also makes mistakes. When they see a person who is actually female, they incorrectly identify her as male 20% of the time. And when they see a person who is actually male, they incorrectly identify him as female 20% of the time.

4. Now, the witness has identified the attacker as male. But we don't know if the witness is correct or not because we don't have enough information to know if the witness saw a male or a female.

5. To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the actual percentage of males in the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

6. Since we don't know if the witness is correct or not, we cannot directly use the witness's statement to update our belief about the gender of the attacker. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our belief based on the prior probability (the percentage of males in the city) and the likelihood of the witness's statement given the gender of the attacker.

7. However, without knowing the prior probability that the witness's statement is true (i.e., without knowing the probability that the attacker is actually male), we cannot provide a strict probability.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict probability estimate based on the information given. A more detailed investigation would be needed to make a more accurate estimation.
