Given the information provided, there are two sources of information to consider: the overall population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The overall population distribution suggests that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. This is the prior probability of the attacker being male.

2. The witness's accuracy in gender identification suggests that in a 50/50 gender split, they correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err 20% of the time. This means that the witness's judgment is not perfect, but it leans towards accuracy.

Given these two pieces of information, Bayes' theorem can be used to update the prior probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states that the updated probability, or posterior probability, is equal to the prior probability multiplied by the likelihood of the event given the prior, divided by the sum of the prior probability multiplied by the likelihood of each possible event.

In this case, the event is the witness's identification of the attacker as male. The prior probability is the probability of the attacker being male in the population, which is 0.15. The likelihood of the event given the prior is the probability that the witness would identify a male attacker as male, which is 0.8 based on their accuracy.

The posterior probability is then calculated as:

posterior probability = prior probability * likelihood / (prior probability * likelihood + (1 - prior probability) * (1 - likelihood))

Plugging in the values, we get:

posterior probability = 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.14) = 0.12 / 0.26 = 0.4615

So, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.46 or 46%.
