To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given and make an assumption about the reliability of the witness's gender identification in the dark.

Since we don't have enough information to quantify the witness's error rate in such conditions, we'll assume that the witness's ability to identify gender at night is the same as in well-lit conditions (80% correct, 20% error).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the probability that the witness made a correct identification, which is 0.8 (80%).

However, the witness's identification is not the only factor to consider. We also know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. So, even if the witness was correct in their identification, there's still a chance that the attacker was actually female.

To account for this, we need to find the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male, and then multiply it by the probability of the attacker being male. This is known as Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(wM) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(wF) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male

We know that P(M) + P(F) = 1, and we're given P(M) = 0.15 (15%). We also know that P(wM) = 0.8 (80%), and P(wF) = 0.2 (20%).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(M|wM) = P(wM|M) * P(M) / (P(wM|M) * P(M) + P(wM|F) * P(F))

We can rewrite P(wM|M) as 1 (since the witness is always correct when identifying a male), and P(wM|F) as 0 (since the witness never mistakes a female for a male).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M|wM) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0 * 0.85)) = 0.15 / 0.15 = 1

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, this result indicates that the witness's identification is certain evidence that the attacker is male. This is unlikely, given that we also know that the majority of the city's population is female.

This paradox arises because we've assumed that the witness's ability to identify gender in the dark is the same as in well-lit conditions. If the witness's ability to identify gender at night is worse, the probability that the attacker is male would be lower.

In conclusion, without more information, it's not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. The given information is inconsistent, and further investigation is needed to resolve the paradox.
