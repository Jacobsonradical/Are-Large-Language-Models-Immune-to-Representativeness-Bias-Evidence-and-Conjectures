Given the two pieces of information provided, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. According to the first piece of information, the attacker is expected to be female with an 85% probability and male with a 15% probability.
2. However, we also have the witness's testimony that the attacker is male. The validity of this testimony can be assessed using the probability of the witness making a correct identification.
3. According to the second piece of information, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
4. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can consider this as a successful identification for the witness.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed male, given the witness's testimony, is equal to the probability of the witness making a correct identification.
6. So, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (or 80%).

In dictionary format:
{probability: 0.8}
