To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know the actual gender of the attacker, we can assume that the witness's judgment might be biased by the city's gender distribution (85% female and 15% male).

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male). We can set up an equation based on Bayes' theorem:

P(male) = [P(male | witness is correct)] * P(witness is correct) + [P(male | witness is incorrect)] * P(witness is incorrect)

We know that P(witness is correct) = 0.8 and P(witness is incorrect) = 0.2. However, we don't have direct information about P(male | witness is correct) or P(male | witness is incorrect).

To make an educated guess, we can assume that the witness's judgment is not significantly biased by the city's gender distribution. In this case, P(male | witness is correct) ≈ P(male) and P(male | witness is incorrect) ≈ P(female).

Since the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, we can approximate that P(male) ≈ 0.15 and P(female) ≈ 0.85.

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem equation, we get:

P(male) ≈ [P(male | witness is correct) * 0.8] + [P(female | witness is incorrect) * 0.2]

Since we assumed P(male | witness is correct) ≈ 0.15 and P(female | witness is incorrect) ≈ 0.85, we can further simplify this equation:

P(male) ≈ [0.15 * 0.8] + [0.85 * 0.2]

Calculating the equation, we get:

P(male) ≈ 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
