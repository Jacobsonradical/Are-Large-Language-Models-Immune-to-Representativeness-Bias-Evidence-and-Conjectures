Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The attacker's gender is unknown to the victim.
2. According to the city's population statistics, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.
3. A witness, who was not the victim, identified the attacker as male. However, their ability to accurately identify gender is only 80% accurate, meaning they make errors 20% of the time.

The witness's statement that the attacker is male provides some information, but it's not definitive because of the witness's error rate. To account for this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of updating the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H0 as the hypothesis that the attacker is female (since this is the majority in the city)
- H1 as the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability P(H1|E) can be calculated as follows:

P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H0) * P(H0)]

We know:
- P(H0) = 0.85 (probability that the attacker is female)
- P(H1) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is male)
- P(E|H1) = 1 (since the witness was correct when the attacker is indeed male)
- P(E|H0) = 0.2 (witness's error rate when identifying a female as male)

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem equation:

P(H1|E) = [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the value:
P(H1|E) ≈ 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.14)
P(H1|E) ≈ 0.15 / 0.29
P(H1|E) ≈ 0.5172

So, given the witness's statement and the city's population statistics, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 51.72%.
