To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's reliability and the gender distribution in the population.

1. The witness has an 80% success rate in identifying gender, with a 20% error rate.
2. The city's population consists of 85% females and 15% males.

However, since the attack happened at night, the witness might not have had sufficient information to accurately judge the gender based on visual cues. To account for this, let's assume that the witness's ability to accurately identify gender in this specific situation is lower than their usual 80%.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake in this specific situation:

1. The witness errs 20% of the time in a controlled environment.
2. In this specific situation, due to the darkness, we assume the witness's accuracy is reduced by 50% (to account for the lack of visual cues).
3. So, the probability of the witness erring in this situation is 20% * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10%.

Next, let's consider the possibility that the witness identified the attacker as male due to an error:

1. The attacker's gender is unknown, but we know the city's gender distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. If the attacker is female, the probability of the witness making an error is 0.1 or 10%.
3. If the attacker is male, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the gender is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 or 90%.

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male:

1. If the attacker is female, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is 0.1 or 10%.
2. If the attacker is male, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is 0.9 or 90%.
3. Since we don't know the attacker's gender, we need to weight these probabilities by the gender distribution in the city: 0.1 * 0.15 (probability of an attacker being male) + 0.9 * 0.85 (probability of an attacker being female).

The final probability that the attacker is male is: 0.1 * 0.15 + 0.9 * 0.85 = 0.1295 or approximately 12.95%.
