Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

The theorem is calculated as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification as male)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability of the attacker being male in the population)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker, given that the attacker could be either male or female)

Let's break this down:

1. P(A): This is provided as 15% in the question. So, P(A) = 0.15.

2. P(B|A): The witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

3. P(B): The probability of the witness identifying a male attacker is given as 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1-P(A)), since the witness mistakenly identifies a female attacker as male 20% of the time. So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1-0.15) = 0.14.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.14 â‰ˆ 0.571

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.571.
