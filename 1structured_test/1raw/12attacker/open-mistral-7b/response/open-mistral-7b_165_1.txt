To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:

- A: The attacker is male
- ∼A: The attacker is not male (i.e., the attacker is female)
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as male
- ∼E: The witness identifies the attacker as female

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female, so 15% is male)
2. P(∼A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
3. P(E | A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
4. P(E | ∼A) = 0.2 (The witness errs in identifying gender 20% of the time)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to compute P(A | E):

P(A | E) = P(E | A) \* P(A) / [P(E | A) \* P(A) + P(E | ∼A) \* P(∼A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A | E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Calculating the probability:

P(A | E) ≈ 0.13

So, given the information and the witness's ability to judge gender, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 13%.
