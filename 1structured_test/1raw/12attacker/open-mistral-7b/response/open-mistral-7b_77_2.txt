Given the information provided, let's reason through this problem:

1. We have a witness who, under normal conditions, correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

However, the witness made an identification in a situation where they couldn't see the attacker's gender clearly. This means that even if the attacker was female, the witness might have mistakenly identified them as male due to their error rate.

So, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male (given that the attacker is indeed male) is 0.8 (80%). But since we also need to account for the possibility of the witness erring and mistakenly identifying a female attacker as male, we need to consider the female population as well.

Given that 85% of the population is female, there is a high probability that the attacker is female. Therefore, the probability that the witness erroneously identified a female attacker as male is significantly higher than the probability that they correctly identified a male attacker.

To calculate this, we can use the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2 (20%). Since there is a 15% chance of the attacker being male, the probability of the witness erring and identifying a male attacker as female is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (3%).

However, since the witness errs more often with female identifications, the actual probability that the attacker is male might be lower than 0.8. To estimate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Identified as Male) = P(Identified as Male | Male) * P(Male) / [P(Identified as Male | Male) * P(Male) + P(Identified as Male | Female) * P(Female)]

Where P(Male) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (which we know is 0.15), and P(Identified as Male | Male) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (which we know is 0.8).

We also need to find P(Identified as Male | Female), which is the likelihood of the witness erring and identifying a female attacker as male. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, and there is a 85% chance of the attacker being female, this probability is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Male | Identified as Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us an estimated probability of 0.13 (13%), which is significantly lower than the 80% the witness reported.

In summary, despite the witness's report, the available information suggests that the probability that the attacker is male is actually quite low, around 13%. This is due to the witness's known error rate and the high proportion of females in the population.
