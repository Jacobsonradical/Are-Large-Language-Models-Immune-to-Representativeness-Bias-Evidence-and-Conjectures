Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. A witness identified the attacker as male with an 80% accuracy rate and a 20% error rate.
2. In the city where the incident occurred, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Let's reason through this problem:

1. The witness's accuracy rate of 80% means that, in an unbiased scenario, they would correctly identify a male attacker 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%) of the time, due to the 15% male population.
2. However, the witness incorrectly identified a female as male 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%) of the time.
3. Since the witness's total error rate is 20%, we can assume that the remaining 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (or 3%) of their errors come from misidentifying a male as female.

Now let's calculate the probability that the witness was correct in identifying the attacker as male:

1. The probability of the witness making a correct identification of a male attacker is 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 (or 15%).
2. However, the witness's report of a male attacker is more likely to be an incorrect identification of a female as male (17%) than it is to be a correct identification of a male attacker (15%).
3. Therefore, we can infer that the actual probability of the attacker being male is likely higher than 15%.

Answering strictly in the dictionary format:
{probability: higher than 0.15, no specific number can be provided based on the given information}
