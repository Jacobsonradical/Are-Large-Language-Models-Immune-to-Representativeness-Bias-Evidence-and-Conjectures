To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of a random person being male is 0.15.

The witness, however, is not always correct in identifying gender. In 20% of the cases, the witness makes an error. This means that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time and incorrectly identifies a male as female 20% of the time.

In this case, the witness identified the attacker as male. Since we don't know if the witness made an error or not, we need to consider both possibilities.

If the witness made an error, then the real gender of the attacker is actually female. In this case, the probability of the witness making a correct identification is 0.2 (20%), and the probability of the witness making an error is 0.8 (80%). Since the actual probability of a person being male is 0.15, the probability of the witness identifying a female as male (given that the actual gender is female) is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

If the witness did not make an error, then the real gender of the attacker is indeed male. The probability of the witness making a correct identification is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness making an error is 0.2 (20%). Since the actual probability of a person being male is 0.15, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

Since we don't know which of these two scenarios is true, we need to consider both equally likely. Therefore, the overall probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is the average of these two probabilities: 0.12 (probability of error) + 0.12 (probability of no error) = 0.24.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.24 (or 24%). This means that there is a slightly higher than 1 in 4 chance that the attacker is male, based on the given information.
