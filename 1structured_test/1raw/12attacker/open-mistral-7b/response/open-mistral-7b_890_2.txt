Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the prior probability of A divided by the probability of B.

Here, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Let's break it down:

1. The prior probability of A (the attacker being male) is not given in the information, but we can estimate it using the population statistics provided in point b. Given that 85% of the population is female, the prior probability of A must be 15%.

2. The probability of B given A (the witness correctly identifying a male attacker) is given in point a as 0.8 or 80%.

3. The probability of B given not-A (the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male) is given in point a as 0.2 or 20%.

4. The probability of A and not-A respectively in the population is given by the prior probabilities.

5. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of A given B: P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Plugging in the numbers, we get:
P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

Calculating this gives us:
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.227

So, based on this analysis, we estimate that the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 22.7%.
