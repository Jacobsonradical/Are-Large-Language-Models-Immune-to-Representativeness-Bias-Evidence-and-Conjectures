To provide an estimate, we need to consider two probabilities: the prior probability (before any evidence) and the likelihood ratio (based on the witness's testimony).

1. Prior probability: Since the attacker's gender was not visible, we should consider the overall population distribution as our prior probability. Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

2. Likelihood ratio: The witness, with an accuracy rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%, identified the attacker as male. This means that when the witness is presented with a male and a female, they correctly identify the male 80% of the time.

Let's denote the probability of the witness making a mistake when seeing a male as F (false positive rate). We know that F = 0.2 and 1 - F = 0.8 (true positive rate). The likelihood ratio (LR) is the ratio of the probability of the witness making this identification given that the attacker is male to the probability of the witness making the same identification given that the attacker is female.

LR = P(witness identifies male | attacker is male) / P(witness identifies male | attacker is female)

Since the witness's gender judgement is independent of the attacker's gender, the probability of the witness making the same identification given that the attacker is female is the same as the false positive rate.

LR = 1 - F / F = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

Now we can calculate the posterior probability (probability after considering the evidence) by multiplying the prior probability and the likelihood ratio:

Posterior probability = Prior probability * Likelihood ratio

Posterior probability = 0.15 * 4 = 0.6

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution, is 0.6.
