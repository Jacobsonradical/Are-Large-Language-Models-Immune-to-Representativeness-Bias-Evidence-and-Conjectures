Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, we also have a witness who incorrectly identified the gender 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male. If the attacker was indeed female, then the witness would have erred in their identification.
4. So, to account for the witness's error rate, we need to subtract the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is female from 1.
5. The probability of the attacker being female is 0.85, as per the population statistics.
6. Given the witness's error rate of 20%, the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is female is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.
7. So, the probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is female is 1 - 0.80 = 0.20.
8. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is male multiplied by the probability of the attacker being male, plus the probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is female multiplied by the probability of the attacker being female.
9. The probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is male is 1, as the witness did identify the attacker as male.
10. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is (1 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32.

In summary, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.32.
