To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the overall gender distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The overall gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possibilities:

a) The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender.
b) The witness made an error in gender identification.

Let's calculate the probabilities for each of these possibilities:

a) If the attacker is indeed male (which is the case if the witness correctly identified the gender), the probability of this happening is simply the proportion of males in the city, which is 15%.

b) If the attacker is female, but the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male, the probability of this happening is the probability of the witness making an error multiplied by the proportion of females in the city. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the probability of this happening is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.

Now we can calculate the overall probability of the attacker being male by adding these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32, or 32%}

So, based on the given information, there is a 32% chance that the attacker is male.
