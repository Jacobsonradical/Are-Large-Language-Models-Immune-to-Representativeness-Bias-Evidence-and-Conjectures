To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy.

1. The population distribution: 15% of the city's population is male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, there's an important caveat: the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, which means they erred in this specific case. Since we know the witness errs 20% of the time, and they identified the attacker as male, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker is actually female 20% of the time, given this witness's error rate.

The problem is, we don't have enough information to know what proportion of the time the witness correctly identified the attacker as male. We only know they erred in this case.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it's impossible to provide a reliable probability estimate. The attacker could be male or female, and we cannot make an informed guess at this point.
