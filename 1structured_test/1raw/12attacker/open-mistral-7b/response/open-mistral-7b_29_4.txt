Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is male, and E is the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as male.

1. P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male. Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, this means P(H) = 0.15 (probability of male).

2. P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.

3. P(E|~H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female. Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2.

4. P(H) + P(~H) = 1, so P(~H) = 0.85 (probability of female).

5. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.21

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.6667

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.67, or 67%.
