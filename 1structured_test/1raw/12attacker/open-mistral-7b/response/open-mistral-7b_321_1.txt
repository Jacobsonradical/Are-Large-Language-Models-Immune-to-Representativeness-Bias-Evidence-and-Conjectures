To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker being male)
- E is the evidence (witness statement and city demographics)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy in gender identification when the person is actually male)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (proportion of males in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (not directly calculable, but we can use it as a normalizing factor)

Given the information in the problem, we can calculate the values of the variables as follows:

1. P(E|H): The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time when the person is actually male. So, P(E|H) = 0.8.

2. P(H): The problem states that 85% of the population is female, so 15% is male. So, P(H) = 0.15.

3. P(E): We cannot directly calculate this, but we can use it as a normalizing factor to make sure that the sum of P(H|E) and P(not H|E) equals 1.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

We cannot directly calculate P(E), but we can rearrange the equation to solve for P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

However, the problem does not provide information about P(E|not H), the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is female. Without this information, we cannot calculate a precise value for P(H|E).

But we can make an approximate estimate by assuming that the witness's accuracy in gender identification is the same when the person is actually female (since the problem does not provide any information to suggest otherwise). In this case, P(E|not H) = 0.8, and the equation becomes:

P(H|E) ≈ P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

P(H|E) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85]

P(H|E) ≈ 0.084 / 0.4516

P(H|E) ≈ 0.188

So, our estimate is that the attacker is likely to be male with a probability of approximately 0.188 (or 18.8%). However, this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's accuracy in gender identification is the same when the person is actually female, which may not be the case. Therefore, this estimate should be interpreted with caution.
