Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and errs 20% of the time.
2. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

However, we should consider that the witness's ability to identify gender may not be perfectly representative of the population distribution. Let's assume that the witness's gender identification accuracy is independent of the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given this assumption, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male by considering the witness's error rate:

1. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.20.
2. If 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, this means that 85% of the people the witness encounters will be female.
3. Therefore, the expected number of times the witness will incorrectly identify a female as male is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%)
4. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.80.
5. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is therefore 1 - 0.80 = 0.20
6. Since 15% of the population is male, the expected number of times the witness will incorrectly identify a male as female is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 (or 3%)

The total probability of the witness making a mistake, regardless of whether the person is male or female, is the sum of the two error rates: 0.17 + 0.03 = 0.20.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, which is 0.80.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.80}.
