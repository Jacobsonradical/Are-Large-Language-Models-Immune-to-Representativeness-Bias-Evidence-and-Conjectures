To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given and make an assumption about the attacker's gender being independent of the witness's ability to identify gender.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Given these facts, let's calculate the probability:

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 20% (as stated in the information). Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of encountering a female person is 0.85 and the probability of encountering a male person is 0.15.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 0.2 (20%) times the probability of encountering a male person, which is 0.15.

So, P(witness incorrectly identifies male) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 100% - 20% = 80% times the probability of encountering a male person, which is 0.15.

So, P(witness correctly identifies male) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is equal to the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male.
