Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80%, but there is an error rate of 20%.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.
3. Since the witness mistakenly identified the gender 20% of the time, we can assume that their errors are equally distributed between male and female.
4. Given this, we can calculate the probability that the witness's mistake was in identifying the attacker as male: 0.20 / 2 = 0.10 or 10%.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the probability of their identification being correct plus the probability of the witness's mistake being in favor of male: 0.80 + 0.10 = 0.90 or 90%.

The estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.90.
