To solve this problem, we need to consider the information given and make an estimate based on Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) in light of new evidence (the witness's gender identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is male) given the evidence (witness identification),
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identifying a male as male),
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being male before considering the evidence),
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis).

From the given information, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(H) = Unknown (we need to estimate this)
- P(E) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H)) (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is a weighted sum of the probabilities of the attacker being male and being female)

Given that the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can infer that P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male).

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.2 = 0.32

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.12 / 0.32 = 0.375

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.375 or 37.5%.
