Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence to consider: the gender distribution in the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

1. The city's gender distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender: 80% correct, 20% error.

However, the second piece of information seems to contradict the first one. The witness identified the attacker as male, but the probability of a male attacker, based on city demographics, is 15%. This is lower than the witness's error rate of 20%.

So, it seems there might be some inconsistency or insufficient information in the given data. If we were to make an estimate, given the witness's track record, we might think the attacker could be male, but the numbers don't quite support that conclusion based on city demographics alone.
