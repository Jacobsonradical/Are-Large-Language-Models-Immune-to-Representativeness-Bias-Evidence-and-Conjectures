Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is male
- ~A: the event that the attacker is not male (i.e., female)
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

The prior probability of A (P(A)) is given as 15% in the information. The likelihood of E given A (P(E|A)) is given as 100% (since the witness identified the attacker as male), and the likelihood of E given ~A (P(E|~A)) is given as 20% (since the witness was wrong 20% of the time in similar conditions).

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|E) = 1 * 0.15 / [1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|E) ≈ 0.15 / 0.245 ≈ 0.608

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.608 or 60.8%.
