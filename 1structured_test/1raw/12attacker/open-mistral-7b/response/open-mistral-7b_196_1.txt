To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't have information about whether the witness's errors are more likely to be misidentifying males as females or females as males. Let's assume for now that the errors are evenly distributed.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the attacker's gender is more likely to be female. However, the witness's error rate suggests that even in this situation, there is a chance that the witness would misidentify the attacker as male.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use the witness's error rate and the probability of the attacker being female (given the city's gender distribution).

Let's denote:
- P(Male) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(Female) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(Error|Male) as the probability of the witness making an error and misidentifying a male as female
- P(Error|Female) as the probability of the witness making an error and misidentifying a female as male

Given that the errors are evenly distributed, we have:
- P(Error|Male) = P(Error|Female) = 0.2

We also know that the total probability of all outcomes is 1:
- P(Male) + P(Female) = 1

Given that 85% of the population is female, we can calculate P(Female):
- P(Female) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(Male):
- P(Male) = 1 - P(Female) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

The witness correctly identifies gender in 80% of the cases, so the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker is:
- P(Correct|Male) = 0.8

Since the witness made an error in identifying the attacker, we can assume that the attacker was actually misidentified as female. In this case, the probability that the witness makes an error and misidentifies a male as female is 0.2.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability that the witness's error is due to misidentifying a male as female is:
- P(Error and Misidentified as Female|Male) = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16

The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male, is the probability of the witness making no error:
- P(Correct|Male and No Error) = 1 - P(Error and Misidentified as Female|Male) = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability of the witness making no error, given that the witness identified the attacker as male:
- P(Male|Witness's Statement) = P(Correct|Male and No Error) * P(No Error|Witness's Statement) / P(Correct|Witness's Statement)

First, let's calculate P(No Error|Witness's Statement):
- P(No Error|Witness's Statement) = P(Male and No Error) + P(Female and Error)
- P(Female and Error) = P(Female) * P(Error|Female) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
- P(No Error|Witness's Statement) = 0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0 = 0.15

Now, we can calculate P(Male|Witness's Statement):
- P(Male|Witness's Statement) = 0.15 * 0.84 / 0.8 = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%. This estimate assumes that the errors are evenly distributed, which might not be the case in reality. If the errors are more likely to be misidentifying males as females, the probability that the attacker is male could be higher. If the errors are more likely to be misidentifying females as males, the probability that the attacker is male could be lower. However, without more information, it's difficult to make a more precise estimate.
