To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume that the witness's gender judgment is independent of the actual gender of the person they are observing. This means that the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a male as female is the same as the probability of mistakenly identifying a female as male.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, this implies that:
- The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80
- The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a male as female is 0.20

The probability of the witness identifying a person as male, given that they are actually male, is 0.80.

Similarly, the probability of the witness identifying a person as female, given that they are actually female, is also 0.80, but since the city is 85% female, the probability of the witness encountering a female in the first place is 0.85.

Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, given that they are actually male, can be multiplied by the probability of the witness encountering a male in the first place:

Final estimated probability of the attacker being male = 0.80 (probability of correct identification given male) * 0.15 (probability of encountering a male) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
