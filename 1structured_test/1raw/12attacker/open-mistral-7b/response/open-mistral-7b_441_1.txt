To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- p as the witness's probability of correctly identifying a male (0.8)
- q as the witness's probability of incorrectly identifying a male (1 - p = 0.2)

The witness's observation results in identifying the attacker as male. Given the witness's errors, this could have occurred either due to the attacker being male (with probability P(M)) or due to the attacker being female but misidentified as male (with probability P(F) * q).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(M) as follows:

P(M) = [P(Observation|M) * P(M)] / [P(Observation|M) * P(M) + P(Observation|F) * P(F)]

We have P(Observation|M) = p (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time) and P(F) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female).

We don't have a direct value for P(Observation|F), but we can calculate it using the complementary probability: P(Observation|F) = 1 - P(Observation|M) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(M):

P(M) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.12 / 0.182 = 0.66

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.66 or 66%.
