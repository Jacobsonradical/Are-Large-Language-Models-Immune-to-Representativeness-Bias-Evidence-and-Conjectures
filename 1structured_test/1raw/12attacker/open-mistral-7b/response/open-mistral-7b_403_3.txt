To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the gender distribution in the witness's sample is the same as the city's population, then we can calculate the expected number of correct identifications for both genders:

Expected male identifications = Total male population * Witness's accuracy rate
                                         = 0.15 * 0.8
                                         = 0.12

Expected female identifications = Total female population * Witness's accuracy rate
                                              = 0.85 * 0.8
                                              = 0.68

The total number of expected identifications is the sum of these two:

Total expected identifications = Expected male identifications + Expected female identifications
                                            = 0.12 + 0.68
                                            = 0.8

However, the witness made a total of 1 identification in this case. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that this identification was one of the 0.12 expected male identifications.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is equal to the expected number of male identifications divided by the total number of expected identifications:

{probability: 0.12 / 0.8, probability: 0.15}

The probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 or 15%.
