To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the gender distribution in the city is representative of the people the witness encounters, then the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a male as female is 20% (since 80% of the time they correctly identify males and 20% of the time they err).

Similarly, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male is also 20% (since 80% of the time they correctly identify females and 20% of the time they err).

Now, we know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. Since the witness errs in identifying gender 20% of the time, the actual proportion of males in the population that the witness identifies as male is 15% * (1 - 0.2) = 0.12 (12%).

The actual proportion of females that the witness identifies as female is 85% * (1 - 0.2) = 0.68 (68%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the proportion of males that the witness identifies as male, which is 0.12.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.12}
