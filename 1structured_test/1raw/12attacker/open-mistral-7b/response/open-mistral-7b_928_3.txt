Given the two pieces of information, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The probability of the attacker being female, given the population distribution, is 0.85. The probability of the witness misidentifying a female as male is 0.2 (since the witness is 80% accurate).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being female can be calculated as the probability of the witness misidentifying a female as male:

P(female | witness's statement) = P(witness misidentified | female) * P(female)
P(female | witness's statement) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

The probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's statement, is the complement of the above probability:

P(male | witness's statement) = 1 - P(female | witness's statement)
P(male | witness's statement) = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's accuracy is constant. Since the witness's accuracy can vary under different conditions, it's important to note that this is an approximate calculation.

{probability: 0.83, please note that this calculation assumes constant witness accuracy and may not accurately reflect reality}
