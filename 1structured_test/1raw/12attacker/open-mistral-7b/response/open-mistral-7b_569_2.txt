To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an assumption about the attacker's gender given the witness's reliability in gender identification.

From the first piece of information (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. However, we do not have information about the gender distribution of the people the witness was observing in that sample.

From the second piece of information (b), we know that the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Given that the witness is not perfect in gender identification, we cannot simply assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as male is 100% accurate. Instead, we can use the witness's error rate to estimate the probability that the attacker is actually male.

Let's assume that the true gender distribution of the attacker is 85% female and 15% male. If the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, we can think of this as an error that favors the male population because it increases the estimated proportion of male attackers. Similarly, if the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female, this is an error that favors the female population.

Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time, we can expect that 20% of the time the witness will incorrectly identify a male as female. This means that for every 4 true female identifications, there will be 1 false positive (mistakenly identifying a female as male).

However, since the population is 85% female, we would expect 85/100 * 4 = 3.4 false positives for every 1 true male identification. This means that the actual number of false positives will be closer to 3 or 4, as we cannot have a fraction of a false positive.

Since we have 1 true male identification and either 3 or 4 false positives, the total number of times the witness identifies a male is 1 + 3 or 1 + 4 = 4 or 5.

The probability of the witness identifying a male given that the attacker is male is 1/4 or 1/5.

Since the witness identifies the attacker as male, we can use this probability to estimate the probability that the attacker is actually male. This is done by multiplying the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male by the prior probability of the attacker being male.

The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (from information b).

So the probability that the attacker is male is (1/4 or 1/5) * 0.15 = 0.03 or 3%.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is constant for all genders. Since we do not have information about the witness's error rate for identifying males versus females, this calculation should be treated as an approximation and not as a definitive answer.
