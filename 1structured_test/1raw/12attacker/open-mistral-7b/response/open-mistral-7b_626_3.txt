To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the new evidence is the witness's observation and the gender distribution in the city.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (witness's observation)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness's accuracy)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (gender distribution in the city)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (without considering the hypothesis)

Given the information provided, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

1. P(E|H) (probability of the witness's observation given that the attacker is male): The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases, so P(E|H) = 0.8.
2. P(H) (prior probability of the hypothesis): Since 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, P(H) = 0.15.
3. P(E) (probability of the evidence): This is the sum of the probabilities of the evidence given each hypothesis, multiplied by the prior probabilities of those hypotheses. Since there are only two hypotheses (male or female), this simplifies to P(E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] + [P(E|~H) * P(~H)]. However, we only have information about P(E|H), so we cannot calculate P(E) directly.

Unfortunately, without knowing P(E), we cannot calculate P(H|E) directly. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. However, we can say that the witness's observation slightly increases the likelihood that the attacker is male, given the gender distribution in the city.
