To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of a false positive (mistaking a female as male) and a false negative (mistaking a male as female).

The probability of a false positive is equal to the proportion of females in the city multiplied by the witness's error rate:

P(false positive) = Number of females * Error rate
                            = 0.85 * 0.20
                            = 0.17

The probability of a false negative is equal to the proportion of males in the city multiplied by the witness's error rate:

P(false negative) = Number of males * Error rate
                              = 0.15 * 0.20
                              = 0.03

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the probability of a true positive (correctly identifying a male attacker). This can be calculated as the probability of a false negative plus the probability of a true positive:

P(true positive) = 1 - P(false negative)
                          = 1 - 0.03
                          = 0.97

The probability of the attacker being male is equal to the probability of a true positive divided by the sum of the probabilities of a true positive and a false positive:

P(attacker is male) = P(true positive) / (P(true positive) + P(false positive))
                                 = 0.97 / (0.97 + 0.17)
                                 â‰ˆ 0.848

So, according to the witness's ability to judge gender and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 84.8%.
