The information provided can be broken down into two parts: the population demographics and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population demographics: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time.

However, there's an important difference between the city's demographics and the witness's accuracy. The demographics give us the probability of the attacker being male in the general population. But the witness's accuracy tells us the probability that the witness would correctly identify a male attacker if one were present.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can use the witness's accuracy to update our probability. If the witness is correct, then the attacker is indeed male. If the witness is wrong, then the attacker is female.

Let's represent the probability of the attacker being male as P(male), and the probability of the witness being wrong as P(wrong).

We know that P(male) + P(female) = 1 (since the attacker must be either male or female).

We also know that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female 20% of the time. Therefore, P(wrong) = 0.2 when the attacker is male.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write the equation:

P(male) * 0.8 (witness is correct) + P(female) * 0.2 (witness is wrong) = 1

Solving for P(male), we get:

P(male) = (1 - 0.2) / (0.8) = 0.875

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 87.5%.
