To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population gender distribution and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender.

From the given information, we know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. However, the witness's ability to identify gender correctly is only 80% and errs 20% of the time.

The witness's statement that the attacker is male might be correct, but it might also be an error due to the witness's misidentification. To account for both possibilities, we can calculate the probabilities for each scenario and then weigh them based on their likelihood.

1. Scenario A: The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender. In this case, the attacker is actually male (since the population is 15% male). The probability of this scenario is the witness's accuracy in identifying gender, which is 0.8.

2. Scenario B: The witness mistakenly identified the attacker's gender. In this case, the attacker is actually female (since the population is 85% female). The probability of this scenario is the witness's error rate in identifying gender, which is 0.2.

Since the witness's statement can be either Scenario A or Scenario B, we can calculate the overall probability of the attacker being male by multiplying the probability of each scenario by its likelihood and then summing them up:

Probability of Attacker being Male = Probability of Scenario A * Likelihood of Scenario A + Probability of Scenario B * Likelihood of Scenario B

The likelihood of Scenario A (witness's correct identification) is the actual percentage of males in the population, which is 0.15. The likelihood of Scenario B (witness's error) is the percentage of females in the population, which is 0.85.

Using these probabilities and likelihoods, we can calculate the overall probability of the attacker being male:

Probability of Attacker being Male = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
