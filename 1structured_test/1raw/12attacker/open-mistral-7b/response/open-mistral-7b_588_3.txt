To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in determining gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- e as the error rate of the witness in determining gender

Given the information, we know that:
1. The witness incorrectly identifies a person's gender with an error rate of e = 0.2.
2. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

The witness's reported accuracy in determining gender is 80%, which means that they correctly identify the gender 80% of the time. Since the error rate is 20%, this means that the witness incorrectly identifies the gender 20% of the time.

The witness incorrectly identifies a male as female with a probability of e = 0.2, and they incorrectly identify a female as male with the same probability. Since there are twice as many females as males in the city, the number of times the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male is twice the number of times they incorrectly identify a male as female.

Let's denote the number of males in the city as M and the number of females as F. We know that F = 1.7M, as there are 85% females and 15% males in the city.

When the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female, they are effectively "counting" a female as a male. Since there are twice as many females as males, the number of times the witness makes this mistake is twice the number of males. Therefore, we can say that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female with a probability of 2e.

Given that the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, the probability that they correctly identify a male is 0.8. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female with a probability of 2e, the probability that they incorrectly identify a male is 2e \* (1 - 0.8) = 1.6e.

The witness's report that the attacker is male implies that they identified the attacker as male with a probability of 0.8. However, since they have a 15% chance of making an error in this identification, the actual probability that the attacker is male is:

P(M) = 0.8 \* (1 - 1.6e) = 0.8 - 1.28e

We don't have a direct value for e, but we can express e in terms of P(M) using the information that the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time and that there are twice as many females as males in the city.

Let's denote P(F|M) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female, given that the attacker is male. We know that P(F|M) = e = 0.2, and we can express P(M) in terms of P(F|M) using the information that the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time.

We can write the following equation:

0.8 = P(M) + P(F|M) \* P(F)

Substituting P(F) = 1.7M and P(F|M) = e = 0.2, we get:

0.8 = P(M) + 0.2 \* 1.7M

Simplifying, we get:

0.8 = P(M) + 0.34M

Rearranging the terms, we get:

0.46M = P(M)

Since M is the number of males in the city, M is a positive integer, and 0 < P(M) < 1. Therefore, we can say that 0 < 0.46M < 1.

However, without a specific value for M, we cannot provide a precise numerical estimate for P(M). We can only say that the probability that the attacker is male is between 0.46 times the number of males in the city and 1.

Therefore, the answer in the requested dictionary format is:
{probability: between 0.46 \* M and 1, where M is the number of males in the city}
