Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population statistics and the witness's testimony. Let's analyze each one:

1. Population statistics: The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. This suggests that the attacker is more likely to be female, given the majority of the population.

2. Witness's testimony: The witness, despite having a lower accuracy rate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male. This piece of evidence contradicts the population statistics.

Now, we need to weigh these two pieces of evidence. The probability of the attacker being male based on population statistics can be calculated as follows:

Probability based on population statistics = Fraction of male population
                                                                     = 0.15

However, the witness's testimony suggests that the attacker might be male despite the majority of the population being female. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the updated probability:

P(Attacker is male | Witness testimony) = [P(Witness testimony | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male)] / [P(Witness testimony)]

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, we can calculate P(Witness testimony | Attacker is male) as follows:

P(Witness testimony | Attacker is male) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

Using the given population statistics, we can calculate P(Attacker is male) as 0.15.

Finally, we can calculate P(Witness testimony) using the Bayes' theorem formula for both male and female cases and then summing them up:

P(Witness testimony) = P(Witness testimony | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness testimony | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female)

Given the witness's accuracy rate, we can calculate P(Witness testimony | Attacker is female) as follows:

P(Witness testimony | Attacker is female) = 0.20

Now, we can calculate P(Witness testimony):

P(Witness testimony) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker is male | Witness testimony) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.241

The estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.241 or 24.1%.
