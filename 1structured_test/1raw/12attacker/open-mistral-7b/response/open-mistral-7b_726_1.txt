Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this counts as a correct identification. However, we should account for the fact that the majority of the population in the city is female (85%).

The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, can be calculated as the probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is male, multiplied by the probability of the attacker being male.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification when the attacker is male is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15%). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%.

However, the witness's identification also counts as an error if the attacker is actually female (which is more likely given the city's demographics). We need to account for this as well.

The probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is female is 0.2 (20%), and the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85 (85%). Therefore, the probability that the witness's identification is an error, given that the attacker is female, is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17, or 17%.

Given the witness's identification, there are two possible scenarios: either the witness made a correct identification (which means the attacker is male) or the witness made an error (which means the attacker is female). The probability of the first scenario is 0.12, and the probability of the second scenario is 0.17. Since these two probabilities add up to more than 100%, it seems that we have a contradiction in the information given.

Without resolving this contradiction, it is not possible to provide a strict estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. However, given the overwhelming majority of the population being female, it seems unlikely that the attacker is male. Therefore, it might be reasonable to tentatively conclude that the attacker is female, despite the witness's identification. This would imply a probability of the attacker being male of less than 0.12.
