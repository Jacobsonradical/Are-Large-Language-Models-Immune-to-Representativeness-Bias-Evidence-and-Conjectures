To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

a) The witness was correct in identifying the attacker's gender.
b) The witness made an error and misidentified a female as male.

Let's calculate the probability for each scenario:

a) If the population distribution is accurate, then the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15%).

b) If the witness made an error, then the probability of misidentifying a female as male is 0.2 (20%). Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this means the attacker is actually female, and the witness made an error. So, the probability of this scenario is 0.2.

However, we need to account for the witness's reliability in gender identification. If the witness makes an error, we should consider the possibility that the attacker is actually female. In this case, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 (80%).

So, the probability of the witness making an error and misidentifying a female as male is 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16.

Since there are two possible scenarios (the witness was correct or made an error), we can calculate the total probability by adding these two probabilities:

total probability = 0.15 (probability of correct identification) + 0.16 (probability of error and misidentification)

total probability = 0.31

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.31 (31%).
