To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's gender is independent of the witness's ability to correctly identify gender, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

In this case, event A is the attacker being male, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

We know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the city's population is 15% male)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So,

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.3448

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.3448 or 34.48%.
