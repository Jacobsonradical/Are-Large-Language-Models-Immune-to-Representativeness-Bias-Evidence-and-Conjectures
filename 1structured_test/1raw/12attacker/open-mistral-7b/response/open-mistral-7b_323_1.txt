To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's errors are biased towards misidentifying males as females or females as males. Let's assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the errors are random and equally likely in both directions.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification as follows:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.15 (the proportion of males in the population) * 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying males) = 0.12
2. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03
3. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a female is 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68
4. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Since the errors are assumed to be random, the total probability of the witness making an error is 0.03 + 0.17 = 0.20 (which matches the 20% error rate we were given).

The witness identified the attacker as male, so the probability that the attacker is actually male is equal to the probability of the witness making a correct identification, which is 0.12.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.12}
