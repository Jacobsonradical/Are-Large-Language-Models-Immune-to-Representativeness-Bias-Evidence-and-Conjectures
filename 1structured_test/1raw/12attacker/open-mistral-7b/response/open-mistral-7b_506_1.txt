To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a person who is actually male, there is an 80% chance that they will correctly identify this person as male. Conversely, when the witness sees a person who is actually female, there is a 20% chance that they will mistakenly identify this person as male.

Given that the victim could not see the attacker's gender, we can think of this situation as the witness seeing the attacker for the first time. The probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male if the attacker is actually male is 0.8 (from point 2). The probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male if the attacker is actually female is 0.2 (also from point 2).

The witness identified the attacker as male. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the probability that the witness would identify a male as male, multiplied by the probability that the attacker is actually male, plus the probability that the witness would identify a female as male, multiplied by the probability that the attacker is actually female.

Mathematically, this can be written as:

P(attacker is male | witness's identification) = P(witness identifies a male as male and attacker is male) + P(witness identifies a female as male and attacker is female)

Using the given probabilities, we can calculate these values as follows:

P(witness identifies a male as male and attacker is male) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(witness identifies a female as male and attacker is female) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

So, P(attacker is male | witness's identification) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
