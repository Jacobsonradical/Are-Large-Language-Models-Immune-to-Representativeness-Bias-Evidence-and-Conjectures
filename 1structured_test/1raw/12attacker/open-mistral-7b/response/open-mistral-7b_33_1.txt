Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a probability theorem used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is male
- B as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We have two pieces of information:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to estimate
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is given as 0.8
- P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male, which is given as 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identifies the attacker as male, which is what we want to find

Bayes' theorem is given by P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To find P(A), we can use the given population statistics:
- P(A) = number of males in the population / total population = 0.15

Now we can calculate P(B):
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * (1 - 0.15)) = 0.24 + 0.015 = 0.255

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.255 â‰ˆ 0.471

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.471 (or 47.1%).
