To provide an estimate, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

The population statistics indicate that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is only 80% accurate, with an error rate of 20%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can't be 100% sure that the attacker is actually male because of the witness's error rate. We need to account for the possibility that the witness made a mistake.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M). According to the Bayes' theorem, we can estimate P(M) as follows:

P(M) = [P(M | witness's statement) * P(witness's statement | M)] / [P(witness's statement | M) * P(M) + P(witness's statement | not M) * P(not M)]

Where:
- P(M) is the probability of the attacker being male
- P(witness's statement | M) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(M | witness's statement) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified a male
- P(not M) is the probability of the attacker being female
- P(witness's statement | not M) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker

From the information given, we know that P(M) = 0.15, P(witness's statement | M) = 0.8, P(not M) = 0.85, and P(witness's statement | not M) = 0.2.

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12 or 12%. This estimate takes into account both the city's population statistics and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.
