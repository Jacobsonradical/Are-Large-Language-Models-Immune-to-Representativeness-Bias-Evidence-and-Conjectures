Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

1. The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.
3. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, we can consider this as a form of bias. The probability of the witness erring in identifying a male as female would be equal to the probability of erring in identifying a female as male. Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of the witness erring in identifying a male as female would be 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
4. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male would be 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
5. However, since we know that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male should be greater than 0.12.
6. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, we can assume that the real probability of the attacker being male is higher than 0.12 but lower than 1.

Therefore, based on the provided information, an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male would be between 0.12 and 1. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a more precise estimate.
