To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. The formula is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is male,
- B is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Let's break down each term:

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male. Since we don't have any specific information about the attacker, we can assume that the population is equally distributed between males and females. So, P(A) = 0.5.

P(B|A) is the likelihood that the witness would identify a male as male. Given that the witness was correct 80% of the time, we can calculate this probability as 0.8.

P(B|~A) is the likelihood that the witness would identify a female as male. Given that the witness was incorrect 20% of the time, we can calculate this probability as 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

P(B) is the probability that the witness would identify someone as male. This can be calculated as P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.6.

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.5333

So, based on the given information, there is approximately a 53.33% chance that the attacker is male. This estimate takes into account the witness's ability to judge gender and the gender distribution in the city.
