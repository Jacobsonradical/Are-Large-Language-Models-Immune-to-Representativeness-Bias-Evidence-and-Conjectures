To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in determining gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. If we assume the attacker's gender is randomly distributed in the city (with 85% female and 15% male), we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification as male.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case,
- A is the attacker being male,
- B is the witness identifying the attacker as male,
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (which we don't know yet),
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male if the attacker is male (given as 0.8),
- P(A|B) is the probability we are interested in (the posterior probability),
- P(B) is the prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which is the sum of the product of the prior probability of the attacker being male and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, and the product of the prior probability of the attacker being female and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male.

Let's denote:
- P(A) = p (the prior probability of the attacker being male),
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying male attackers),
- P(A|B) = the probability we want to find (the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification as male),
- P(B) = P(B|A) * p + P(B|not A) * (1-p) (the prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male)

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2. Using the given information, we can rewrite P(B) as:

P(B) = 0.8 * p + 0.2 * (1-p)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We can solve for p by setting P(A|B) equal to a desired value (e.g., the probability we estimate the attacker is male) and rearranging the equation to get:

p = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Using the given values for P(B|A) and P(B), we can calculate the value of p that leads to the desired probability of the attacker being male.

After calculating the value of p, we can find the probability of the attacker being male using the formula:

{probability: 0.15}

This is a rough estimate based on the given information and assumptions. In reality, the exact probability might vary depending on other factors, such as the specific context of the attack and potential biases in the witness's gender identification.
