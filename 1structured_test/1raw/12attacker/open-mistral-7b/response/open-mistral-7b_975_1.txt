Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, the event of interest is the attacker being male, and the new evidence is the witness's gender identification. The prior probability of the attacker being male is the proportion of males in the population, which we know from information b to be 15%.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability of the attacker being male (the event of interest)
P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker
P(B|~A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male
P(A|B) as the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified a male
P(~A|B) as the probability of the attacker being female given that the witness identified a male

We are given the following values:
P(A) = 0.15
P(B|A) = 0.8
P(B|~A) = 0.2

We need to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified a male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.03]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.15
P(A|B) = 0.8

So our estimate, based on the given information, is that the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8, or 80%. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the given information and assumptions, and that the actual probability may be different.
