The probability estimate of the attacker being male, given the information provided, can be calculated as follows:

1. We know that the witness incorrectly identifies the gender 20% of the time.
2. We also know that 80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies the gender.
3. In this case, the witness identified the attacker as male.
4. However, we don't know if the witness was correct or incorrect in this specific case.
5. To estimate the probability of the attacker being male, we can assume that the witness's ability to identify gender is independent in each case.
6. This means that the probability of the witness being correct in this specific case is the same as the probability of the witness being correct in general, which is 0.8 (80%).
7. But we need to account for the fact that 85% of the population is female. If the attacker was female, there's a higher chance that the witness would misidentify the gender (since the witness errs 20% of the time).
8. So, the probability that the attacker is male can be calculated as the probability that the witness was correct given that the attacker is male, multiplied by the proportion of males in the population.
9. The probability that the witness was correct given that the attacker is male is 0.8, and the proportion of males in the population is 0.15 (15%).
10. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.12} or 12%.
