To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errors 20% of the time, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement.

Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male and P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female. Let P(M|W) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, and P(F|W) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female.

We are given that P(M|W) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy) and P(F) = 0.15 (from the city's gender distribution). We can assume that P(F|W) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time).

According to Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)].

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.12 / 0.28 = 0.4286

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.4286 or 42.86%.
