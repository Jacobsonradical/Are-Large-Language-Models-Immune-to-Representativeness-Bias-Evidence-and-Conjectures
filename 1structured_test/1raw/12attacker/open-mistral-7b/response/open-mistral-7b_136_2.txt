To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is male
- ¬H: the attacker is female
- E: the witness identified the attacker as male

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The probability of correctly identifying a person's gender is 0.8, and the probability of making an error is 0.2.
2. The proportion of males in the population is 0.15, and the proportion of females is 0.85.

By Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification (P(H|E)) is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)]

We know that:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness mistakes a female for a male 20% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (proportion of males in the population)
- P(¬H) = 0.85 (proportion of females in the population)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:
