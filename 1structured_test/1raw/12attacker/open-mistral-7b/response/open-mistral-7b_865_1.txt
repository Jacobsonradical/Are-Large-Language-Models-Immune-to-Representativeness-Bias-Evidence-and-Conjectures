To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know the exact number of males and females in the sample the witness judged. Let's assume for simplicity that the sample size is large enough to approximate the gender distribution in the city.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of randomly selecting a male in the city is 0.15.

The witness's error rate of 20% means that for every 100 people they correctly identify, they mistakenly identify 20 as the opposite gender. This means that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time.

Since the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time, they misidentify males as females only 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a male as female is 0.20.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability that the witness correctly identified a male, which is 0.80.

However, since the witness might have made an error in identifying the attacker's gender, we need to consider the possibility of the witness misidentifying a female as a male. The probability of this event is 0.20 (the error rate).

So, the probability that the attacker is actually female and the witness made an error is 0.20.

Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is male is the probability that the witness correctly identified a male plus the probability that the witness made an error and the attacker is indeed a male:

{probability: 0.80 + 0.20 * (1 - 0.85) = 0.80 + 0.035 = 0.835}

The probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.835. This means that given the witness's ability to judge gender and the gender distribution in the city, there is an estimated 83.5% chance that the attacker is male.
