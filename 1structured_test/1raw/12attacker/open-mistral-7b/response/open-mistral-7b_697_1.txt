Given the two pieces of information provided:

1. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's error rate. Since we cannot directly know if the witness's identification was correct or not, we will calculate the probability of the attacker being male and the witness misidentifying a female as male.

Let P(male) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(witness error) be the probability that the witness errs in identifying a female as male.

We know that:
P(male) = probability of the attacker being male
P(witness error) = 0.2 (from the information provided)

We also know that the total probability of all possible events should sum up to 1:
P(male) + P(female) = 1

Since 85% of the population is female, P(female) = 0.85.

Now, we want to calculate the probability that the witness errs when the attacker is actually female. Let P(witness error given female) be this probability. We can write it as:

P(witness error | female) = P(witness error) = 0.2

Since the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time, we can write:

P(correct identification | male) = 0.8

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is female, given the city's gender distribution:

P(witness error given female) = P(witness error) * P(female) / (P(male) + P(female))

We can substitute the known values to calculate P(witness error given female):

P(witness error | female) = 0.2 * 0.85 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.2 * 0.85 / 1 = 0.17

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:

P(male | witness's identification) = P(male) / (P(male) + P(witness error given female))

We can substitute the known values to calculate P(male | witness's identification):

P(male | witness's identification) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.15 / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.46875 or 46.87%.
