To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time (as stated in information b). Given that 85% of the population is female (information a), we can assume that the witness's erroneous identifications mostly involve misidentifying males as females (since there are more females in the city).

Therefore, we can use the witness's error rate of 20% as an upper bound for the probability that they mistakenly identified a female attacker as male. This means that the actual probability that the attacker is male is higher than 80% - 20% = 0.6 or 60%.

However, the witness's gender identification was also found to be unreliable under the specific conditions of the night. So, to account for this uncertainty, we might want to reduce the estimated probability of the attacker being male.

Let's assume that, due to the night conditions, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is reduced by 20%. This would mean their actual accuracy rate is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, or 64%.

Therefore, our adjusted estimate for the probability that the attacker is male would be 0.64 * 0.15 = 0.096 or 9.6%.

In summary, our estimates for the probability that the attacker is male, taking into account both the gender distribution in the city and the witness's reliability, range from 60% to 9.6%.
