To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possibilities:

1. The attacker is indeed male. The probability of this event is the witness's accuracy rate for identifying males. Given that 15% of the city's population is male, the probability of the attacker being male under this scenario is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

2. The attacker is female, and the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male. The probability of this event is the witness's error rate for identifying females. Since 85% of the city's population is female, the probability of the attacker being female under this scenario is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

However, we cannot simply add these two probabilities together, as they do not account for the fact that the witness's gender identification is not always accurate. Instead, we need to weight these probabilities based on the witness's accuracy.

The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is the sum of the probability of the attacker being male and the probability of the attacker being female, multiplied by their respective probabilities of being correctly identified:

Total probability = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2 * 0.8)
                          = 0.12 + 0.1024
                          = 0.2224 or 22.24%

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 22.24%.
