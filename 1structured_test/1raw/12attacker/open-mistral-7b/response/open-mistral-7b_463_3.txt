To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know the actual gender of the attacker, the witness's error rate of 20% includes both cases where the attacker is actually male but the witness identifies them as female, and cases where the attacker is actually female but the witness identifies them as male.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is female, the attacker is more likely to be female. However, we need to account for the witness's error rate.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(female).

We know two things:
1. The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time. So, P(male) * 0.8 + P(female) * 0.2 = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time and a female attacker 20% of the time)
2. The ratio of females to males in the city is 85:15. So, P(female) = 0.85 and P(male) = 0.15

However, we made an assumption here that the witness's error rate is the same for both genders. But the witness might be more likely to err when identifying males, which would make it harder to conclude that the attacker is male based on the witness's statement.

Without this information, we cannot make a more accurate estimate. Therefore, the best we can do is to use the information provided, which suggests that the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.
