To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Given that the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male as "male" correctly and incorrectly.

1. Probability of witness correctly identifying a male as "male" (P(M|M)): The attacker is male, and the witness correctly identifies the gender. This occurs with a probability of 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy).

2. Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a female as "male" (P(M|F)): The attacker is female, but the witness incorrectly identifies the gender. This occurs with a probability of 0.2 * 0.85 (from the gender distribution and the witness's incorrect identification rate).

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male (P(M)), which is the sum of the above probabilities divided by the total probability of the witness identifying a person as "male":

P(M) = P(M|M) + P(M|F)
P(M) = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(M) â‰ˆ 0.82

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.82 or 82%.
