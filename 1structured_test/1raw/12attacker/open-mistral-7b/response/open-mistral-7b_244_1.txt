To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's ability to identify gender correctly is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time.
2. The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is actually male by accounting for both the witness's accuracy and the city's gender distribution.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being male as P(male).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is P(male) * 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time).

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is P(female) * 0.2 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the total probability of this event is the sum of the two probabilities above:

P(witness said male) = P(male) * 0.8 + P(female) * 0.2

We know that 85% of the city's population is female, so P(female) = 0.85. We also know that the sum of P(male) and P(female) should equal 1 (since there are only two possible genders).

Now we can set up and solve an equation to find P(male):

P(male) * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.8
P(male) = 0.6

So, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.6 (or 60%).
