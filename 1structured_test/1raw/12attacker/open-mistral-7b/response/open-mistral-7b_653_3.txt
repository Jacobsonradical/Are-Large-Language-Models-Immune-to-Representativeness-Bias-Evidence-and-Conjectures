To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possibilities:
- The attacker is indeed male (correct identification)
- The witness made an error in identifying the attacker's gender (mistaking a female for a male)

We know that the probability of the witness making an error is 20%, so the probability of the attacker being female and the witness mistakenly identifying him as male is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

The probability of the attacker being male must equal the probability of the witness correctly identifying him as such, plus the probability of the witness making an error and still correctly identifying him as male:

0.15 (probability of attacker being male) = 0.80 * 0.15 (witness correctly identifies male attacker) + 0.20 * 0.85 (witness incorrectly identifies female as male, but still correctly identifies attacker as male)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.15 = 0.12 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.15
0.15 = 0.018 + 0.0255
0.15 = 0.0435

However, this calculation does not make sense, as the sum of probabilities should be less than or equal to 1. This indicates that the witness's reliability in identifying gender is not sufficient to make a reliable estimate based on this single piece of information.

Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. The witness's error rate is too high to draw a definitive conclusion.
