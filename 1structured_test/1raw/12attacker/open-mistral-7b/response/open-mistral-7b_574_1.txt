To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- A: The attacker is male
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as male

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender: P(A|E) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker) and P(not A|E) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness erring and incorrectly identifying a male attacker)
2. The gender distribution in the city: P(A) = 0.15 (the probability of a male in the city), P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability of a female in the city)

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values:
P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculate the result to get the estimated probability that the attacker is male: {probability: 0.1764}
