To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as p_w, and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as q_w. From the given information, we know that p_w + q_w = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time).

We also know the actual gender distribution in the city, which is 85% female and 15% male. Let's denote the probability of an attacker being male as p_a, and the probability of an attacker being female as 1 - p_a.

Given that the witness misidentified the attacker as male, the actual gender of the attacker can only be male. Therefore, the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a female as male is q_w.

Given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, the actual gender of the attacker must be male. The probability of this happening is p_w.

Since the witness misidentified the attacker, the probability of this event is q_w. Therefore, we can write an equation:

q_w = p_w * p_a + (1 - p_w) * q_w

We can simplify this equation to:

p_w * p_a = q_w * (1 - p_a)

We know that p_w + q_w = 0.8, so we can rewrite this equation as:

0.8 * p_a = 0.2 * p_a

From this, we can see that p_a = 0.25 (since 0.8 * x = 0.2 * x implies x = 1/2).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.25, or 25%.
