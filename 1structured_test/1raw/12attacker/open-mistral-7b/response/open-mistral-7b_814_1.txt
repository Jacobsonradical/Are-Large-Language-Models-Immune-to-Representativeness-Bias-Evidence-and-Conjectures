Given the information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. Probability of the attacker being male based on the city's demographics.
2. Probability of the witness misidentifying the gender.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being male based on the city's demographics:
{probability: 0.15, reason: 85% of the population is female, so the remaining 15% must be male.}

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness misidentifying the gender. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we can calculate the probability of misidentification as follows:
{probability: 0.2, reason: 1 - 0.8 = 0.2}

Now, let's consider the possibility that the witness misidentified the attacker's gender. If the attacker is actually female, the witness would mistakenly identify the attacker as male with a probability of 0.2. On the other hand, if the attacker is actually male, the witness would correctly identify the attacker with a probability of 0.8.

To account for both possibilities, we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is female, and multiply it by the probability of the attacker being female, as well as the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is male, and multiply it by the probability of the attacker being male:

Total probability of witness identifying a male attacker = (0.8 * 0.15) + (1 * 0.15 * 0.2)

This simplifies to:

Total probability of witness identifying a male attacker = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

However, the witness did identify the attacker as male, so the probability we are interested in is the conditional probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. This is equal to the total probability of witness identifying a male attacker divided by the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker or a female attacker:

Conditional probability of attacker being male given witness identification = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.8 * 0.05)

This simplifies to:

Conditional probability of attacker being male given witness identification = 0.15 / 0.11 = 0.1364

Therefore, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.1364 or 13.64%.
