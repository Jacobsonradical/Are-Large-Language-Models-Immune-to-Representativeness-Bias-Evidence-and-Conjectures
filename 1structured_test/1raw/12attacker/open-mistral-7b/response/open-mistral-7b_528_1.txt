To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness misidentified the gender of the attacker. Since 85% of the population is female, it's more likely that the witness would misidentify a male as female due to the city's gender distribution.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). Given the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city, we can set up the following probability equation:

P(male) * 0.8 + P(female) * 0.2 = 0.2 (witness's error rate)

We know that P(female) = 0.85, so we can solve for P(male):

P(male) = 0.2 / (0.8 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(male) â‰ˆ 0.16

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 16%.
