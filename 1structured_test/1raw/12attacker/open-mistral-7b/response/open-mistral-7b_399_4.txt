To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness would misidentify a female as male. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of error is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 20%.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability that the witness is observing a female is 0.85. The probability of misidentifying a female as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Now, let's consider the scenario where the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male. Since 15% of the population is male, the probability that the witness is observing a male is 0.15. The probability of correctly identifying a male is 0.8 or 80%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the probability of correct identification times the probability of observing a male, plus the probability of misidentification times the probability of observing a female.

This can be calculated as 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.14 = 0.26 or 26%.

However, the witness's identification was incorrect. Therefore, we need to adjust this probability. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, and the actual gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male, the probability that the witness's identification is incorrect is 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29 or 29%.

Given that the witness's identification was incorrect, the actual gender of the attacker is the opposite of what the witness reported. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's incorrect identification, is the probability that the witness misidentified a female as male. This is 0.17 or 17%.

Since we cannot know whether the witness's identification was correct or incorrect, we need to consider both possibilities and their probabilities. The probability that the witness was correct is 0.29, and the probability that the witness was incorrect is 0.71. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.26 * 0.29 + 0.17 * 0.71 = 0.072 + 0.12 = 0.192 or 19.2%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the two pieces of information, is 19.2%.
