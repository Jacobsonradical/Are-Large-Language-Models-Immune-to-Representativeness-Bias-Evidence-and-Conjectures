Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(M), and the probability that the attacker is female as P(F). The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender as male given that the attacker is male is P(M|witness_M), and the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender as male given that the attacker is female is P(M|witness_F).

From the provided information, we know that P(M) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female, so 15% is male), P(F) = 0.85, P(witness_M|M) = 0.8, and P(witness_M|F) = 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states that P(M|witness_M) = [P(witness_M|M) * P(M)] / [P(witness_M|M) * P(M) + P(witness_M|F) * P(F)].

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|witness_M) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.157 = 0.0766

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 7.66%.

However, the witness's identification is not the only piece of evidence we have. We also know the gender distribution in the city. If we assume that the attack is equally likely to happen to males and females in the city, then the prior probability of the attacker being male is P(M) = 0.15.

Given this prior probability, the Bayes' theorem calculation would give us the updated probability of the attacker being male after taking into account the witness's identification. The calculation would be the same as before, but the probability of the attacker being male in the numerator would be 0.15 instead of 0.8.

Unfortunately, the provided information does not give us enough details to calculate this updated probability. We would need to know the probability that the attack is equally likely to happen to males and females in the city, or some other information that would allow us to estimate this probability.

Therefore, I cannot provide a numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is male, given the additional information about the city's population gender distribution.
