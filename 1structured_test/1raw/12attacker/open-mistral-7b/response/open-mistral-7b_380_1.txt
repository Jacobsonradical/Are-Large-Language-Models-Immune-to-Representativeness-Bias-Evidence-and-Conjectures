To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's assume that the gender distribution in the group of people the witness was observing that night is the same as the gender distribution in the city (since there's no information suggesting otherwise). According to the second piece of information, 15% of the population is male.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can consider this a correct identification 80% of the time if the attacker was actually male, and an error 80% of the time if the attacker was female.

Given that the gender distribution is 15% male and 85% female, and the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability that the witness would correctly identify an attacker as male if the attacker was indeed male is:

0.8 (probability of correct identification) * 0.15 (probability of the attacker being male) = 0.12

However, since the witness errs 20% of the time, and there are more females than males in the population, there is a higher chance of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male than the other way around. The probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a female as male is:

0.2 (probability of error) * 0.85 (probability of the attacker being female) = 0.17

The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is the sum of these two probabilities:

0.12 (probability of correct identification) + 0.17 (probability of error) = 0.29

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%.
