Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, the victim could not identify the attacker's gender.
3. A witness, whose gender identification accuracy is 80% correct and 20% incorrect, identified the attacker as male.

Now, let's consider the two possible scenarios:

Scenario A: The attacker is a female. In this case, the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's gender. The probability of this scenario is 15% (the percentage of males in the city).

Scenario B: The attacker is a male. In this case, the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender. The probability of this scenario is 15% (the percentage of males in the city) multiplied by the witness's accuracy in identifying males, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

To find the overall probability of the attacker being male, we add the probabilities of Scenario B and account for the possibility of an error in Scenario A:

Probability of the attacker being male = Probability of Scenario B + Probability of Scenario A * Probability of witness error

Probability of the attacker being male = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.15 * 0.2)

Probability of the attacker being male = 0.12 + 0.03

Probability of the attacker being male = 0.15

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 15%.
