Given the information provided, we have a witness who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. Since we don't know if the witness's errors are more likely to be misidentifying males as females or females as males, we'll assume an equal error rate for simplicity.

The witness correctly identified the attacker as male. The probability of this happening if the attacker is indeed male is simply the witness's success rate, which is 0.8 or 80%.

However, if the attacker is actually female, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying her as male is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Since we don't have enough information to determine if the witness's errors are more likely to favor one gender over the other, we can't directly use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being female given the witness's statement. Instead, we can calculate the probability of the witness stating that the attacker is male if the attacker is actually male, and the probability of the witness stating that the attacker is male if the attacker is actually female, and then sum these probabilities to get an overall probability.

The probability of the witness stating that the attacker is male if the attacker is actually male is the witness's success rate, which is 0.8 or 80%.

The probability of the witness stating that the attacker is male if the attacker is actually female is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 or 20%.

So the overall probability of the witness stating that the attacker is male is 0.8 (probability of correct identification) + 0.2 (probability of error) * 0.15 (probability of attacker being female) = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is {probability: 0.83, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
