To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be either misidentifying a male as female or a female as male, then the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8 (80%) and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 0.2 (20%).

Since 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of a random person being male is 0.15 (15%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the product of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male and the probability of a random person being male.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is (0.8 * 0.15) = 0.12 (12%).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.12} (12%).
