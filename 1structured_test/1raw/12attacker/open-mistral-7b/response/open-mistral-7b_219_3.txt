To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can assume that if the actual attacker is female, there is a 20% chance that the witness will misidentify the attacker as male. Similarly, if the actual attacker is male, there is a 20% chance that the witness will misidentify the attacker as female.

However, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. So, if we assume that the attacker is actually female, the probability that the witness will still identify the attacker as male is 0.2 (20%).

On the other hand, if we assume that the attacker is actually male, the probability that the witness will identify the attacker as male is 0.8 (80%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we should consider both scenarios and their corresponding probabilities:

1. If the attacker is female:
   - Probability of witness misidentifying a female as male: 0.2
   - Given the witness's identification, this scenario's probability would be: 0.2 * 0.15 (probability of a female attacker) = 0.03

2. If the attacker is male:
   - Probability of witness correctly identifying a male: 0.8
   - Given the witness's identification, this scenario's probability would be: 0.8 * 0.15 (probability of a male attacker) = 0.012

Now, we can calculate the total probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification:

Total probability = Probability of the attacker being male given correct identification * Probability of correct identification + Probability of the attacker being male given misidentification * Probability of misidentification

Total probability = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.15 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 (or 15%).
