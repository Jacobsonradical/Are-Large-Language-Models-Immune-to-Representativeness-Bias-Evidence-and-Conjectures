Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as male. However, we don't have direct evidence that the witness was correct in this instance.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is that the witness identified the attacker as male.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability that the witness would identify a male as male)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability that the attacker is male before considering any evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the probability that the witness would identify anyone as male)

We have the values for P(E|H) and P(H) from the information provided. P(E|H) is 0.8 (80%), and P(H) is the proportion of males in the population, which we're trying to estimate.

The value of P(E) can be calculated as the weighted sum of P(E|H) and P(E|~H), where ~H represents the opposite of the hypothesis (the attacker is female). Since we don't have direct evidence about P(E|~H), we can use the complementary probability P(~E|H) = 1 - P(E|H) = 0.2 (20%), and calculate P(E|~H) as P(E|~H) = P(~E) / P(~H).

We know that P(~H) = 1 - P(H), and P(~E) = 1 - P(E). So, P(E|~H) = (1 - P(E)) / (1 - P(H)).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Substituting the values of P(E|H), P(H), and P(E|~H) into the equation, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 \* P(H)] / [0.8 \* P(H) + (1 - 0.8) \* (1 - P(H))]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 \* P(H)] / [0.8 \* P(H) + 0.2 \* (1 - P(H))]

At this point, we don't have a specific value for P(H), so we can't directly calculate the probability that the attacker is male. However, we can use the given information about the gender distribution in the city to make an educated guess.

Given that 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male, we can infer that P(H) is approximately 0.15 (15%). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

P(H|E) ≈ [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* (1 - 0.15)]

≈ 0.12 / 0.12 + 0.06

≈ 0.12 / 0.18

≈ 0.67

So, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.67 or 67%. This estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify gender is consistent when making a judgement in the dark, which is not necessarily the case.
