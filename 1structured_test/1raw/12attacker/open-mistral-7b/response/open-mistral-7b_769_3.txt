To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in determining gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errored 20% of the time, and that 85% of the population is female, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female as male (type I error) is 20%.

Similarly, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female (type II error) is also 20%, as the witness is equally accurate in both directions.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability we're interested in is the probability of a type I error, which is the probability that a female was mistakenly identified as male.

Given that 85% of the population is female and the witness makes a type I error 20% of the time, the probability of a type I error is:

{probability: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, probability of the attacker being female given the witness's statement is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83}

However, the question asks for the probability that the attacker is male, not the probability that the witness was mistaken. To find this, we subtract the probability of a type I error from 1:

{probability: 1 - 0.17 = 0.83, probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement}

Therefore, based on the witness's statement and their accuracy in determining gender, our estimate is that the attacker is male 83% of the time.
