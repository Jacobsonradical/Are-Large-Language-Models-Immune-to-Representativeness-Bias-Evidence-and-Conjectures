Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's ability to identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If the attacker is indeed male, the witness would correctly identify the gender 80% of the time. However, if the attacker is female, the witness would mistakenly identify the gender 15% of the time (since 15% of the population is male).

Let's use the Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability:

P(Male | Attacker is Male) = Witness's accuracy for male
                                         = 0.8

P(Female | Attacker is Female) = 1 - Witness's accuracy for female
                                                 = 1 - 0.15
                                                 = 0.85

P(Male) = Percentage of male population
               = 0.15

P(Attacker is Male) = P(Male | Attacker is Male) * P(Male) + P(Female | Attacker is Male) * P(Female)
                                 = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.15 * 0.85
                                 = 0.12 + 0.13
                                 = 0.25

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 25%. This means that, given the witness's ability to judge gender and the gender distribution in the city, there is a 25% chance that the attacker is male.
