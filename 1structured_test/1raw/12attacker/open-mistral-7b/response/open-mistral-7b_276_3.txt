Based on the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.
2. In the city, 15% of the population is male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that helps us update our probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (in this case, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (in this case, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male)
- P(B) is the probability of B (in this case, the probability that the witness identified the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (in this case, the probability that the attacker is male, before considering the witness's identification)

Given that we want to find the probability of A (the attacker is male), we can rewrite the formula as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We can calculate the probabilities as follows:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male, given that 15% of the population is male)
- P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16 (the probability of the witness identifying any person as male, regardless of the person's gender)

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.16 = 0.75

The estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.75 or 75%.
