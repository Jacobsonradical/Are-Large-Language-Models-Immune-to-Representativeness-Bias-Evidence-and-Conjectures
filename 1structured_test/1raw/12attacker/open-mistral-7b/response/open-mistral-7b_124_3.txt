To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief in the likelihood of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being male, and the new evidence is the witness's gender identification.

Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the probability of event B

Given the information, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

1. P(A) (prior probability of the attacker being male): This is unknown, but we can infer it based on the city's demographics. According to information (b), 15% of the population is male, so the prior probability is 0.15.

2. P(B|A) (probability of the witness identifying as male given that the attacker is male): The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time, but when they made an error, they identified a male as female 20% of the time. Since the attacker is male, the witness will not mistake them for a female. Therefore, P(B|A) = 1.

3. P(B) (probability of the witness identifying as male): This is given in information (a) as 0.8 (80%).

4. P(A|B) (our estimated probability that the attacker is male): This is what we want to find.

Now we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
         = [1 * 0.15] / [0.8]
         = 0.1875

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.1875 or 18.75%. This means that, given the witness's identification and the city's demographics, we would expect the attacker to be male 18.75% of the time. It's important to note that this estimate is based on the assumptions made in the Bayes' theorem calculation and the accuracy of the provided information.
