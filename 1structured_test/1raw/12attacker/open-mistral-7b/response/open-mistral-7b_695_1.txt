Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being male can be estimated by considering the reliability of the witness and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and the city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male.

To calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's observation, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given evidence E is given by:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

In this case, H is the attacker being male, E is the witness's statement that the attacker is male, P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is male, and P(E) is the probability of the witness's statement.

We have P(H) = 0.15 (15%), P(E|H) = 1 (since the witness's statement is always true if the attacker is male), and we need to find P(E).

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)

Here, ¬H means the attacker is female, and P(E|¬H) is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male. This probability is given as 0.20.

So, P(E) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.15 / 0.32 = 0.46875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.46875, or 46.875%.
