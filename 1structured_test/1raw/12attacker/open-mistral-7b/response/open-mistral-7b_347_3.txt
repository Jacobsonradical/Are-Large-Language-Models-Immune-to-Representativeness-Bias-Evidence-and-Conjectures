Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in determining gender, identified the attacker as male.

However, there's an important distinction to make between the city's population data and the witness's accuracy. The witness's accuracy is a statement about their ability to identify gender in general, while the city's population data is a statement about the gender distribution in the city.

In this case, the witness incorrectly identified the gender of 20% of the people they saw, meaning they incorrectly identified as male 20% of the females they saw. Given that 85% of the city's population is female, this means that the witness incorrectly identified 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17% of all people as male.

Now, we know that the witness identified the attacker as male. However, we have no information about whether the witness's mistake rate applies to this specific situation. If it does, then the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 (the city's male population percentage). If it doesn't, then the attacker could potentially be female, but we don't have enough information to calculate a probability for that.

Therefore, based strictly on the given information, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15. However, it should be noted that this estimate assumes that the witness's mistake rate applies to this specific situation, which is not necessarily the case.
