According to the information provided, 15% of the population is male, and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80% with an error rate of 20%. However, the witness erroneously identified the attacker as male. This means the witness missed identifying a female as the attacker 20% of the time (since the witness was correct 80% of the time).

Given that the attacker was not seen clearly, there is a possibility that the witness actually missed a female attacker and mistakenly identified a male. We can estimate the probability of this happening by calculating the probability of the witness making an error given that the actual gender is female.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of the witness seeing a female attacker is 0.85. The witness's error rate in identifying gender is 0.20. Therefore, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Since the witness did erroneously identify the attacker as male, this suggests that there is a 17% chance that the attacker is actually female and was mistakenly identified as male by the witness. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the evidence, is the complement of this value, which is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.83}.
