To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness's gender identification accuracy is 80%, but we also know that 85% of the population in the city is female. This means that there is a higher probability of encountering females in general.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male
- P(incorrect) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female

We know that P(correct) = 0.8 and P(incorrect) = 0.2. Also, P(M) + P(F) = 1.

The witness identified the attacker as male. If the attacker was indeed male (P(M)), then the witness correctly identified the gender. The probability of this event is P(M) * P(correct).

On the other hand, if the attacker was female (P(F)), then the witness incorrectly identified the gender. The probability of this event is P(F) * P(incorrect).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of this event is the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios: P(M) * P(correct) + P(F) * P(incorrect).

However, we are given that the witness identified the attacker as male with a probability of 1. This means that the actual probability of the event "witness identified the attacker as male" must be equal to the calculated probability:

1 = P(M) * P(correct) + P(F) * P(incorrect)

Now we have two equations with three variables:
1 = P(M) * 0.8 + P(F) * 0.2
P(M) + P(F) = 1

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

P(F) = 1 - P(M)

Substitute P(F) in the first equation:

1 = P(M) * 0.8 + (1 - P(M)) * 0.2

Now solve for P(M):

1 = 0.8P(M) + 0.2 - 0.2P(M)
0.6P(M) = 0.2
P(M) = 0.2 / 0.6
P(M) = 1/3 â‰ˆ 0.33

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.33 or 33%.
