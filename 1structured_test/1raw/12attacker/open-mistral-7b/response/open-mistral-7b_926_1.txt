To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male (before the witness's statement),
- P(M|W) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as male given that the person is actually male,
- P(F|W) as the probability of the witness identifying someone as male given that the person is actually female,
- P(W|M) as the probability of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is male,
- P(W|F) as the probability of the witness making the statement given that the attacker is female,
- P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female (before the witness's statement),
- P(W) as the probability of the witness making the statement (regardless of the attacker's gender).

From the information given, we know that P(M) = 0.15, P(F) = 0.85, P(W|M) = 0.8, and P(W|F) = 0.2. We also know that P(M|W) = P(F|W)^(-1) * P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(M) * P(W|M) + P(F) * P(W|F)), and P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F).

Calculating P(M|W) using these values gives us:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.12}
