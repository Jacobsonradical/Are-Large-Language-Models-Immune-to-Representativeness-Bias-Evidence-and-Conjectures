Given the information provided, we have two sources of probability estimates for the attacker being male:

1. Based on the city's population demographics, if we assume that the attacker is randomly selected from the city population, the probability of the attacker being male is 15% (0.15).

2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% (0.8), but this only applies to conditions similar to the night of the attack. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this is one successful identification out of the total number of attempts the witness has made. However, we don't have enough information to determine the actual number of attempts the witness made.

Since we don't have enough information to directly calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct in this specific case, we cannot provide a strict probability estimate in the requested format. However, it's worth noting that the witness's ability to correctly identify gender (80%) is higher than the city's male population proportion (15%), suggesting that the witness's identification might be more likely to be correct than if the attacker were randomly selected from the city population.
