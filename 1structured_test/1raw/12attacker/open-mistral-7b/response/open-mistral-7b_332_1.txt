To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the population.

The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time and correctly identifies it 80% of the time. If the attacker's gender is actually female, there is a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as male. Conversely, if the attacker's gender is male, there is an 80% chance that the witness will correctly identify the attacker as such.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male as follows:

1. The probability that the attacker is female and the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male is 0.85 (probability of female) * 0.20 (probability of misidentification) = 0.17 (or 17%)
2. The probability that the attacker is male is 1 - the probability that the attacker is female and the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%)

So, based on the witness's statement and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.83 (or 83%).
