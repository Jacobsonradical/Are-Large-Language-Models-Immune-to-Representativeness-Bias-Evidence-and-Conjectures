To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can consider two scenarios:

1. If the witness's gender identification is always accurate, then the attacker is male with a probability of 15% (from the demographic information).

2. If the witness's gender identification is not always accurate, then we need to account for the likelihood of the witness making an error and misidentifying a female attacker as male. According to the information given, the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, and assuming that the witness's gender identification is not always accurate, the most likely explanation is that the witness made an error. In this case, the attacker is likely female, and the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male.

However, we cannot ignore the initial demographic information that 85% of the population is female. If we consider both pieces of information, the probability that the witness made an error and misidentified a female attacker as male is higher than the probability that the attacker is actually male.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the demographic information, is lower than 15%. But without more specific information about the number of errors the witness made in this situation, we cannot provide a precise numerical estimate.

In conclusion, {probability: less than 15%, but a specific number cannot be provided based on the given information}
