To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the population.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. Given that the attacker's gender is unknown, we can consider each gender as an equally likely hypothesis (50% probability for each). If the witness's statement is true, then the attacker is indeed male with a probability of 1. However, since the witness made an error 20% of the time, there's a chance that the attacker is actually female, despite the witness's statement.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male) and the probability of the attacker being female as P(female). We know two things:

1. P(male) + P(female) = 1 (the attacker must be either male or female)
2. The witness correctly identifies the attacker as male with a probability of P(male) * 0.8

Given the gender distribution in the city, we have that the probability of a random person being male is 0.15 (15%). Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. This means that the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's statement, is P(male) * 0.12.

However, we don't have enough information to find P(male). We know that P(male) + P(female) = 1, but we don't know the exact values of P(male) and P(female).

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot provide a strict numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is male. Instead, we can conclude that the probability is likely to be less than 0.12, but we cannot determine its exact value.

{probability: less than 0.12, please note that a strict numerical estimate cannot be provided with the given information}
