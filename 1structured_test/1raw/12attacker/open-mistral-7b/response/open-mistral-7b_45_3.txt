Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, we also know that the witness, who identified the attacker as male, has an error rate of 20% when identifying gender. This means that even if the attacker was actually female, the witness would mistakenly identify the attacker as male 20% of the time.
3. Therefore, the probability that the witness's identification of the attacker as male is correct, given that the attacker is actually male, is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.
4. On the other hand, the probability that the witness's identification of the attacker as male is incorrect, given that the attacker is actually female, is 0.20.
5. Since we don't know the gender of the attacker, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male by considering both the probability that the witness is correct and the probability that the witness is incorrect:
   - Probability of the attacker being male = Probability of witness being correct * Probability of attacker being male given witness being correct
   + Probability of the attacker being male = Probability of witness being incorrect * Probability of attacker being male given witness being incorrect
   = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
   = 0.12 + 0.17
   = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%.
