Given the two pieces of information:

1. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in gender identification and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.

Let's reason through this:

1. Without the witness's identification, the probability that the attacker is male would simply be the city's male population percentage (15%).
2. However, the witness's identification introduces a level of uncertainty. Since the witness is only 80% accurate, there's a chance that they misidentified the gender.
3. We know that in 20% of their gender identification attempts, the witness errs. So, there's a 20% chance that they misidentified the attacker as male when the attacker is actually female.
4. To account for this possibility, we need to adjust our initial probability (the city's male population percentage) by subtracting the erroneous identifications made by the witness.
5. Since there are 8 females for every 10 people in the city (85% female population), there are 1.67 females for every 2 people (100% - 15% male population).
6. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, this means that out of every 10 people, the witness will incorrectly identify 2 as male when they are actually female.
7. So, out of the 1.67 females in every 2 people, the witness will incorrectly identify approximately 0.333 females as male.
8. This means that the actual number of males in the city is slightly less than the stated 15% due to the witness's errors.

The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is therefore less than 15%. To calculate an exact probability, we would need more information, such as the number of times the witness has made gender identification errors in the past and the number of times they have correctly identified genders under similar conditions.

However, given the limited information, it's safe to say that the probability is less than 15% and closer to 15% - (0.333 * 15%) = 14.67%.
