Based on the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the city's demographic data and the witness's testimony.

1. Demographic data: In the city where the incident occurred, 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. This means that if we randomly select a person from the city, the probability that they are male is 0.15.

2. Witness's testimony: The witness, whose gender is not specified, incorrectly identified the attacker's gender 20% of the time. This means that when the witness correctly identifies a person's gender, they are correct 80% of the time. Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the witness was correct is 0.8.

However, we don't have enough information to directly combine these two probabilities. We only know that the witness's testimony increases the probability that the attacker is male, but we don't know by how much.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict numerical estimate in the format you requested. I would recommend further investigation, such as gathering more witnesses or evidence, to get a more accurate estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.
