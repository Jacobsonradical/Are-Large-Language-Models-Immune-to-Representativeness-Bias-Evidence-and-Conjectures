Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

From point A, we know that the witness, who correctly identified gender 80% of the time, identified the attacker as male. However, the city's population is predominantly female (85%), as mentioned in point B.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of A given B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

Let's denote:
- A: Attacker is male
- B: Witness identified attacker as male

First, let's calculate the prior probability of A, which is the probability that the attacker is male in the population. Given that 15% of the city's population is male, the prior probability is 0.15.

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of B given A, which is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male. Given that the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time, the likelihood is 0.8.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of B given not A, which is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, the likelihood is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability of A, which is the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification.

The posterior probability is:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85]

Calculating this, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.31, or 31%.
