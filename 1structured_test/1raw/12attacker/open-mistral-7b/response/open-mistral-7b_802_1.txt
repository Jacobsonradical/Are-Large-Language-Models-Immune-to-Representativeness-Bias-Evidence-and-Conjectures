To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- e_w as the error rate of the witness

We know that the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that P(M|witness sees M) = 0.8 and P(F|witness sees F) = 0.8, while P(M|witness sees F) = e_w and P(F|witness sees M) = e_w.

We also know that 85% of the population in the city is female, so P(F) = 0.85, and P(M) = 0.15.

The witness's statement that the attacker is male implies that the witness saw the attacker and identified him as male. So, we have the equation P(M|witness sees M) * P(witness sees M) = P(M), where P(witness sees M) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender as male.

Substituting the values we know, we get: 0.8 * P(witness sees M) = 0.15

Solving for P(witness sees M), we get: P(witness sees M) = 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.1875

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is male:

P(M) = (P(M|witness sees M) * P(witness sees M)) / [P(M|witness sees M) * P(witness sees M) + P(M|witness sees F) * P(witness sees F)]

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(M) = (0.1875 * 0.1875) / [(0.1875 * 0.1875) + (0.15 * 0.85)]

P(M) â‰ˆ 0.117

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 11.7%.
