To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have specific information about the gender distribution of the people the witness was observing in the sample, we'll make an assumption that the gender distribution in the sample is similar to the gender distribution in the city (which is 85% female and 15% male).

Under this assumption, we can calculate the expected number of times the witness should correctly identify a male in 100 observations. Since there are 15% males and the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we expect the witness to correctly identify a male 15*0.8 = 12% of the time.

However, the witness identified the attacker as male, which means that the witness's statement is consistent with a probability of 12% or higher. But the witness also errs 20% of the time. So there's a probability of 20% that the witness made an error and incorrectly identified the attacker as male.

Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and our assumption, is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.12 + 0.20 = 0.32, the attacker is male with a probability of 32%}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the gender distribution in the sample is similar to the gender distribution in the city. If the gender distribution in the sample is different, the probability would be different as well.
