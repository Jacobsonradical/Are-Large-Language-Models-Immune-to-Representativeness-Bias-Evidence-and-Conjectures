Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's define our variables:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male
- P(H): Prior probability of the attacker being male
  - We don't have this information directly, but we can estimate it based on the city's population information
- P(E|H): Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male
  - According to the information, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8
- P(E|~H): Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male
  - Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2
- P(~H): Prior probability of the attacker not being male
  - Since the city's population is 85% female, the prior probability of the attacker being male is P(H) = 1 - P(~H) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.85)]

Calculating this gives:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.24

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 24%.
