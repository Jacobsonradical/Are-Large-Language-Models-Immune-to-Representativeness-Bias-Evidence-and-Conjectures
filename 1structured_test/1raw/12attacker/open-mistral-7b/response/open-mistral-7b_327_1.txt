To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The general population distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, we cannot directly use the witness's accuracy because the population in the city is not evenly distributed between males and females. To account for this, let's calculate the probability of the witness making an error given the city's population distribution.

1. The probability of a female being misidentified as male by the witness: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%)
2. The probability of a male being misidentified as female by the witness: 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04 (4%)

Now, since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is indeed male, and the witness correctly identified the gender.
2. The attacker is female, but the witness mistakenly identified the gender as male.

The probability of the first scenario is the probability of a male in the city times the witness's accuracy in identifying a male: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

The probability of the second scenario is the probability of a female in the city times the probability of the witness mistaking a female for a male: 0.85 * 0.17 = 0.1455 (14.55%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the probability of the first scenario. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 (12%).
