To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know the actual gender of the attacker, we can't directly use the witness's accuracy. Instead, we'll use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of A given B is equal to the probability of B given A times the prior probability of A divided by the probability of B.

Let's denote:
- A as the attacker being male
- B as the witness identifying the attacker as male

The prior probability of A (P(A)) is the proportion of males in the population, which is 15% (0.15) based on information b.

The probability of B given A (P(B|A)) is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8, as stated in a.

The probability of B given not A (P(B|not A)) is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2, as stated in a.

The probability of not A (P(not A)) is the proportion of females in the population, which is 85% (0.85) based on information b.

Now we can calculate the probability of A given B:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.222

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 22.2%.
