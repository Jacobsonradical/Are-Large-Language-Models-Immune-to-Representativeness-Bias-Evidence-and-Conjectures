To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

The population distribution gives us that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. However, the witness's ability to identify gender is not perfect. They correctly identify gender 80% of the time, but they also err 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we need to account for the possibility that they made a mistake. The probability of a mistake is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.

However, we don't know whether the witness made a mistake in this case or not. If they did make a mistake, they mistakenly identified a female attacker as male. The probability of this happening is equal to the error rate for identifying females as males, which is also 20% (since the witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time, and the error rate for identifying males as females would be the same since the genders are symmetric).

So, the probability that the witness made a mistake and identified a female attacker as male is 20%. But if they didn't make a mistake, then the attacker must be male.

Since we don't know whether the witness made a mistake or not, we can't directly calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Instead, we can calculate the probability that the witness made a mistake and the probability that they didn't make a mistake, and then add these two probabilities to get the total probability.

The probability that the witness didn't make a mistake is 1 minus the probability that they made a mistake, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

If the witness didn't make a mistake, then the attacker must be male. So, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness didn't make a mistake, is equal to the probability that the witness didn't make a mistake, which is 0.8.

Since we don't know whether the witness made a mistake or not, we can't directly use this probability. However, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker is male) given some evidence (in this case, the witness's identification) is equal to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, times the prior probability of the hypothesis, divided by the probability of the evidence.

The probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is male is equal to 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male in this case), and the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).

The probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is female is equal to the error rate for identifying females as males, which is 0.2.

The probability of the evidence (the witness's identification) is equal to the sum of the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis that the attacker is male, and the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis that the attacker is female. This sum is equal to 1 (since the probability of the evidence must be 1).

So, Bayes' Theorem states that the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is equal to the probability of the witness's identification given that the attacker is male, times the prior probability of the attacker being male, divided by the probability of the witness's identification.

Plugging in the values, we get:

0.8 (the probability that the witness didn't make a mistake) times 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male) divided by (1 - 0.2) (the probability of the witness's identification) = 0.12 (the estimated probability that the attacker is male)

So, based on the population distribution and the witness's ability to identify gender, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12, or 12%. However, this estimate is based on certain assumptions about the witness's ability to identify gender under the specific conditions of the attack, and it may not be accurate in all cases. It would be important to gather further evidence to confirm or refute this estimate.
