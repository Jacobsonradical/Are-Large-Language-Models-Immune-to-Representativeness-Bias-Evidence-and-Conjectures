Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is male,
- E as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male,
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being male (given in the first piece of information),
- P(E|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (given in the second piece of information),
- P(E|~A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male (not given, but we can estimate it based on the information that the witness is wrong 20% of the time).

Since there are twice as many females as males in the city, we can assume that the witness is incorrect in identifying a female as male 10% of the time (since 80% of the time, they correctly identify a female as female).

Now, Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A)].

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the probability, we get: P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.16

So, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 16%.
