To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness made an error in this case, identifying the attacker as male. This means that if the attacker was actually female, the witness would have mistakenly identified the attacker as male.

The probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is female is therefore equal to the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

The probability of the attacker being female, given that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male, is the inverse of the probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is female. So, this probability is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we know that the city has an 85% female population. So, the actual probability of the attacker being female is 0.85.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male is the complementary probability of the attacker being female, which is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.15}.
