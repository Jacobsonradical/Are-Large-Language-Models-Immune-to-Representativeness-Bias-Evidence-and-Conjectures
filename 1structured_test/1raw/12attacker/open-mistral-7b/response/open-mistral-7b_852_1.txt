The given information describes two probabilities: the gender distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender. However, there's a missing piece of information: the probability that the witness is correct when the attacker is actually male.

We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time, but we don't know if this 80% includes cases where the attacker is male. Without this information, it's impossible to accurately calculate the probability that the attacker is male based on the witness's statement.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict numerical answer in the format you've requested. To estimate the probability, more information about the witness's performance when identifying male attackers is needed.
