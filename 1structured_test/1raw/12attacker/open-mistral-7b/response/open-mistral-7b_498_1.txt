To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the witness's error in this case was misidentifying a male as female or vice versa, we can assume that the error rate is evenly distributed between the two genders. This means that the witness makes a mistake in identifying gender 10% of the time for each gender (0.2 / 2 = 0.1).

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of the witness seeing a female attacker is 0.85. The probability of the witness erring and misidentifying a female attacker as male is 0.1 * 0.85 = 0.085.

The probability of the witness seeing a male attacker is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male is equal to the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker: {probability: 0.12}
