To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an assumption about the prior probability of an attacker being male or female, given that the victim could not see the attacker's gender. Since we do not have any prior information, a reasonable assumption would be to consider the population distribution as a prior probability.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. However, this information is not directly applicable to the situation at hand because the witness saw the attacker under different conditions than the victim did.

Given that the witness's ability to identify gender is better than chance, we can assume that the witness's identification of the attacker as male adds some evidence in favor of the attacker being male. But since we do not know the exact relationship between the witness's observation and the true gender of the attacker, it is not possible to quantify this evidence precisely.

Therefore, a conservative estimate of the probability that the attacker is male would be the prior probability, which is 0.15. A more optimistic estimate, taking into account the witness's ability to identify gender, would be higher than 0.15 but less than 0.5. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide an exact value for this more optimistic estimate.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.15}
