Based on the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's reason through this:

1. The witness's ability to identify gender is not directly related to the population distribution in the city.
2. However, we know that the witness incorrectly identified the gender of the attacker. Given the population distribution, it's more likely that the attacker is female (85% chance) than male (15% chance).
3. Since the witness erred in their identification, we cannot simply rely on the witness's statement.
4. Therefore, based on the available information, it's more logical to assume that the attacker is female, given the city's population distribution.

However, to provide a strict numerical answer, we would need more information or a way to adjust the witness's error rate based on the specific situation. Without that, I cannot provide a probability estimate between 0 and 1.

Final answer: {probability: Unable to provide a number based on the given information}
