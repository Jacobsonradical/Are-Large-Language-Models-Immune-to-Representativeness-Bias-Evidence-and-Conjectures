Given the two pieces of information, we have a population with a 85% female and 15% male distribution (information "a"). However, we also have a witness who, in similar conditions, correctly identified gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time (information "b"). The witness identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the distribution in the population and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender. Since we know that the witness is likely to make errors, we should adjust the initial population distribution to account for this.

Let's assume the witness identified a random person from the city. Given the population distribution, the probability of choosing a female is 0.85 and a male is 0.15. However, when the witness makes an error, they will incorrectly identify a female as male with a probability of 0.2 (since there are twice as many females as males).

Given the witness's 20% error rate, we can calculate the adjusted probability of the attacker being male as the sum of the actual male probability and the probabilities of misidentifying a female as male:

Adjusted probability = 0.15 (actual male probability) + 0.2 * 0.85 (probability of misidentifying a female as male)

Given the values, we get:

Adjusted probability = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, taking into account the witness's error rate, is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
