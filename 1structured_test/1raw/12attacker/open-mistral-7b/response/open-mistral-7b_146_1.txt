Based on the provided information, the witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80% and their error rate is 20%. However, we don't have enough information about the gender balance of the attacker's immediate vicinity at the time of the incident.

The second piece of information tells us that 85% of the population in the city is female and 15% is male. But without knowing if the attacker was in a location that conformed to this city-wide gender distribution, we cannot use this information to make a precise estimate.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict probability estimate based on the given information. It would require additional context or information about the attacker's location or circumstances to make a more accurate assessment.
