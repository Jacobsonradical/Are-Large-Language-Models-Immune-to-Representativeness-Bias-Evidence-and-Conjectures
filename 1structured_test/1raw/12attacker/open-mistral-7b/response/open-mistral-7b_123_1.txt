Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(Event | Evidence) = [P(Evidence | Event) * P(Event)] / [P(Evidence)]

In this case:
- Event: Attacker is male
- Evidence: Witness identified the attacker as male

From the information provided, we know:
- P(Event) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(Evidence | Event) = 1 (since the witness always correctly identifies males)
- P(Evidence | not Event) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker is female)
- P(not Event) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

P(Event | Evidence) = [P(Evidence | Event) * P(Event)] / [P(Evidence) + P(Evidence | not Event) * P(not Event)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Event | Evidence) = [1 * 0.15] / [1 + 0 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the probability, we get:

P(Event | Evidence) ≈ 0.15 / 0.92 ≈ 0.163

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 16.3%.
