Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being male) given new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is male
- Β: the event that the witness identified the attacker as male
- P(A): the prior probability of the attacker being male (given in the information as 15%)
- P(B|A): the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male (given in the information as 80%)
- P(B|¬A): the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male (given in the information as 20%)
- P(¬A): the prior probability of the attacker not being male (1 - P(A) = 0.85)

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male of approximately 0.22, or 22%.
