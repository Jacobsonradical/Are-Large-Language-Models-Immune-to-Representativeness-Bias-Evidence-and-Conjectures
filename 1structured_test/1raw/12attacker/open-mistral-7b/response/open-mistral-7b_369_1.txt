To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the initial population statistics and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. Initially, 15% of the population is male, and 85% is female.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:
   a) The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender.
   b) The witness made an error.

We can calculate the probability of each scenario:

a) The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 15% (the initial probability of a male attacker).

b) The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female attacker as male is 20% (the error rate of the witness) times 85% (the probability of the attacker being female).

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying a male attacker:

P(Male attacker) = P(Witness correctly identifies male) + P(Witness mistakes female for male)

P(Male attacker) = 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(Male attacker) â‰ˆ 0.275

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 27.5%.
