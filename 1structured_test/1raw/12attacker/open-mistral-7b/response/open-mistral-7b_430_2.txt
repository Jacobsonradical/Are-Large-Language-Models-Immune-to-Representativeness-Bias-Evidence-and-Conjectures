To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given and make an educated guess.

First, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as male with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Since the witness's accuracy rate is higher than the city's male population rate, it suggests that the witness might be more likely to identify a person as male than to be correct about the city's male population ratio.

Given this information, it seems reasonable to assume that the witness's identification might be biased towards identifying people as male. Therefore, the actual probability that the attacker is male might be lower than the 15% city's male population rate.

However, without more specific information about the witness's biases or the circumstances of the identification, it's not possible to provide a precise numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is male.

So, unfortunately, I cannot provide a strict dictionary format answer with a number between 0 and 1 at this time.
