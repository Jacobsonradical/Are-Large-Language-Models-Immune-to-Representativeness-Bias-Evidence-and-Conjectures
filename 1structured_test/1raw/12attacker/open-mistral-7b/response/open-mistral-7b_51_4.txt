To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being male
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker being female
- P(E|H): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male
- P(E|~H): the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male

The data given to us is:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (80% chance of correctly identifying a male as male)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (20% chance of incorrectly identifying a female as male)
- P(H) + P(~H) = 1 (the total probability of the attacker being either male or female)
- P(F) = 1 - P(H) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is female)

We can rewrite P(H) as P(H) = 1 - P(F) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the given values into the formula:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.85 / [0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15]

Calculating the result:

P(H|E) = 0.68

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.68 or 68%.
