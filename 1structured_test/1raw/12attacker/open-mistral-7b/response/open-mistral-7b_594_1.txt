To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. According to the given statistics, 15% of the population is male.
2. The witness, however, is not 100% reliable. They correctly identify gender 80% of the time and misidentify 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

a) The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender, in which case the attacker is indeed male.
b) The witness made an error, in which case the attacker is actually female, but the witness mistakenly identified them as male.

Let's calculate the probabilities for these two scenarios:

a) Probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender (male) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy)

b) Probability that the witness made an error (mistakenly identifying a female as male) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate)

Since there are 15% males in the population, the probability that the attacker is a male in the population is 0.15. However, we need to account for the fact that the witness can make mistakes, so the probability that the witness correctly identified a male is lower than 0.15.

The probability that the witness made an error (mistakenly identifying a male as female) is 0.2. Since there are 85% females in the population, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female as a male is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (this is the probability of both events happening: the witness makes an error and the attacker is female).

The probability that the witness correctly identified a male is then:

1 - Probability that the witness made an error (mistakenly identifying a male as female) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy) times 0.88 (the probability that the witness correctly identified a male):
