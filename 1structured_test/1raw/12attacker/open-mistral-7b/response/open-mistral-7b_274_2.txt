Given the information provided, there are two sources of data to consider: the population demographics and the witness's ability to accurately identify gender.

1. From the population demographics (information point a), we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's ability to identify gender is not perfect, as stated in information point b. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, the witness's identification was incorrect in the case of the attacker. This means that the witness's mistake is included in the 20% error rate. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this case contributes to the 20% error rate.

The attacker's gender is not known, but we know that the witness erred in their identification. This error could have occurred because the witness mistook a female for a male (false positive) or because they failed to identify a male (false negative).

Given that the population is 85% female, it is more likely that the witness made a false negative error. In this case, the true attacker was a female, but the witness mistakenly identified them as male.

To estimate the probability of the attacker being male, we should consider the witness's error rate and the likelihood of a false negative error.

The witness's error rate is 20%, and we know that this error rate includes false negatives. To find the probability of a false negative error, we can subtract the witness's correct identification rate from 1.

So, the probability of a false negative error is:

{probability: 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, or 20%}

Since the population is 85% female, and there is a 20% probability of a false negative error, the probability of the attacker being male is:

{probability: 0.15 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.117, or 11.7%}

In conclusion, according to the provided information and the reasoning above, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 11.7%. This estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's error rate includes both false positive and false negative errors and that the error rate is higher for female misidentifications. However, additional information or context could affect this estimate.
