Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. We have a witness who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's statement. We'll use Bayes' theorem to do this:

P(Male | Statement) = [P(Statement | Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Statement | Male) * P(Male) + P(Statement | Female) * P(Female)]

Where:
- P(Male) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is the population probability of 15%.
- P(Statement | Male) is the probability of the witness making the statement "I saw a male" given that the attacker is male. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, this is 0.8.
- P(Statement | Female) is the probability of the witness making the statement "I saw a male" given that the attacker is female. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, this is 0.2 * (1 / 0.85) = 0.2353.

Calculating P(Male | Statement):
P(Male | Statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2353 * 0.85)) = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12, or 12%.
