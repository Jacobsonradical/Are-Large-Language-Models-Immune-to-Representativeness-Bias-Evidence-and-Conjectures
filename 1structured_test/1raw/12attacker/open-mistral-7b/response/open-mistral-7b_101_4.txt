Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and they err 20% of the time. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Since the witness couldn't see the attacker's gender, we can assume that the probability of the witness making a correct guess is equal to their success rate of 80%. This means that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as male (given that the attacker is actually female) is equal to their error rate of 20%.

However, since 85% of the population is female, the probability that the attacker is female is higher than 85%. Therefore, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male (given that the attacker is actually female) is higher than 20% multiplied by 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being male).

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being female as p and the probability of the attacker being male as 1-p. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female is 0.2 * p.

We know that the probability of the witness making a correct guess is 0.8, so 0.8 = 0.8 * p + 0.2 * (1-p).

Solving this equation for p, we get p = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2 * 0.15) = 0.8 / 0.85 = 0.94.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 1 - 0.94 = 0.06, or 6%. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to judge gender is unaffected by the darkness and the fact that they could not see the attacker's face. In reality, this assumption may not hold, and the actual probability could be different.
