To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. The population distribution: According to the information provided, 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the probability that this mistake occurred, given that the attacker is actually female. This probability can be calculated as the error rate for identifying females as males.

Error rate for identifying females as males = 20% (witness's error rate)

The probability of the attacker being male is then the complement of this error rate, as we are looking for the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender:

Probability of attacker being male = 1 - Error rate for identifying females as males
                                             = 1 - 0.2
                                             = 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 or 80%.
