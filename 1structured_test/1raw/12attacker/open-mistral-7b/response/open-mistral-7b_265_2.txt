To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- p: the probability that the attacker is male
- q: the probability that the attacker is female
- e: the error rate of the witness in gender identification (1 - accuracy rate) = 0.2

From the witness's ability to judge gender, we know that:
p + q = 1

And from the gender distribution in the city, we know that:
q = 0.85

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we also know that the witness made a correct judgment in this case. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

p = 1 - e * (1 - p)

Now, we can solve for p:

p = (1 - e) / (1 + e)
p = (1 - 0.2) / (1 + 0.2)
p = 0.75

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.75 or 75%.
