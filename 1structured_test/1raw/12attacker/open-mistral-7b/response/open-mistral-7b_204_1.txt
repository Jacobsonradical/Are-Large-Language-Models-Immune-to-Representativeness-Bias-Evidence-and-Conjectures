Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

The formula is: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (witness identification and city population demographics)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

From the given information, we have:
- P(E|H) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male, which is 0.8 (80%)
- P(E|~H) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female, which is 0.2 (20%)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to find
- P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 1 - P(H)
- P(E) is the probability of the witness making a correct identification, which is P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

The city's population demographics give us P(~H) = 0.15 and P(H) = 0.15 * (1 / [0.15 + 0.85]) = 0.143

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.143] / [0.8 * 0.143 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%. This estimate is lower than the 80% accuracy of the witness because the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is not perfect, and there is a higher proportion of females in the city.
