To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the initial population distribution and the witness's reliability.

First, let's assume that the population statistics in the city are accurate. So, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Next, we know that the witness misidentifies gender 20% of the time. This means that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as male. However, we cannot directly use this information to estimate the attacker's gender because we don't know if the witness was correct in this case. To account for the witness's error rate, we need to consider both the possibility that the witness was correct and the possibility that the witness was wrong.

If the witness was correct, then the attacker is indeed male, and the probability of this event is the witness's correct identification rate, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

If the witness was wrong, then the attacker is actually female, but the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male. The probability of this event is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

Since we don't know which of these two scenarios is true, we need to consider both of them and calculate their probabilities. The overall probability that the attacker is male is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (witness was correct) + 0.2 * 0.15 (witness was wrong, but attacker is still male because the city has a high female population).

Calculating this gives us a probability of 0.8 + 0.024 = 0.824 or 82.4%.
