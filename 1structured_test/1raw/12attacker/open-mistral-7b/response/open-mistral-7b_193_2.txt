To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the attacker's gender was not seen directly by the victim, we can consider the witness's observation as an additional piece of evidence.

However, it's important to note that the witness might have made an error in this case as well. Given that the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, it's more likely that the attacker is female, which might have led to a misidentification by the witness.

To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error in favor of a male attacker, given that the attacker is actually female. Since the witness errs 20% of the time and the city is 85% female, the probability of the witness erring when the actual attacker is female is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

On the other hand, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (given that the city is 15% male).

Since we don't have enough information to determine whether the witness made an error in this case or not, we can't directly combine these probabilities. However, if we assume that the witness's error in this case is independent of their overall error rate, we can calculate the overall probability of the attacker being male.

The overall probability of the attacker being male is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker and the probability of the witness erring in favor of a male attacker when the actual attacker is female.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, or 29%.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's error in this case is independent of their overall error rate, which might not be the case. Therefore, this is an approximate estimate and the actual probability may be different.
