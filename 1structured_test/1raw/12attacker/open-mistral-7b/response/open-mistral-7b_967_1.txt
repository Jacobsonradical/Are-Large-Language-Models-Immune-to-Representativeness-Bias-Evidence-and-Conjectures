To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a probability theory that describes the relationship between prior knowledge and new evidence.

In this case, the prior probability (P(A)) is the proportion of males in the population. We know this from the second piece of information: P(A) = 0.15 (15% male).

The likelihood (P(B|A)) is the probability that the witness would misidentify the gender given that the attacker is female. From the first piece of information, we know that the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.2.

The likelihood of the evidence given that the attacker is male (P(B|~A)) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the gender. From the first piece of information, we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so P(B|~A) = 0.8.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the evidence:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
