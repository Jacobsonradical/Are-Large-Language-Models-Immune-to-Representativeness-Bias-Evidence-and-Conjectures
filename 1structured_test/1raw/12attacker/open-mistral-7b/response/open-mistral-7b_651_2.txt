To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Let's break this down:

1. P(E | H): The probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time, and erred 20% of the time. So, P(E | H) = 0.8.

2. P(H): The prior probability of the hypothesis. Since we don't have any information about the gender of the attacker before the witness testified, we can assume that the prior probability of the attacker being male is equal to the proportion of males in the city. From the information given, this is 15%. So, P(H) = 0.15.

3. P(E): The probability of the evidence. To find this, we can use the witness's accuracy rate for both genders and the gender ratio in the city. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and there are 15% males in the city, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male attacker as female is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03. Since there are 85% females in the city, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. So, P(E) = 0.12 + 0.03 + 0.17 = 0.32.

Now, we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E)
         = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32
         = 0.12 / 0.32
         = 0.375

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.375 or 37.5%.
