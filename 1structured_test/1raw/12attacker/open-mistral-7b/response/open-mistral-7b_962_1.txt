Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness has a 80% success rate in identifying gender, but errs 20% of the time.
2. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Now, let's consider the scenario from the perspective of the attacker's gender:

1. If the attacker is male, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male is 0.8 (80%).
2. If the attacker is female, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male is 0.15/0.85 = 0.1765 (15% female population divided by the 85% female + 15% male population, or the probability of observing a female given that the attacker is actually male).

To find the overall probability of the attacker being male, we must weigh the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male with the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male:

{
  "probability": 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1765 * 0.2
  = 0.12 + 0.0353
  = 0.1553
}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.1553 or 15.53%.
