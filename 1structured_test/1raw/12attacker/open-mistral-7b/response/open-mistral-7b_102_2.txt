Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male.
2. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as male, but their accuracy in gender identification is only 80% and they make errors 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually male, we need to account for both the city's gender distribution and the witness's error rate. Let's assume that the attacker is indeed male (the event we are interested in). In this case, the witness would correctly identify the attacker's gender 80% of the time.

On the other hand, if the attacker is actually female (the event we are not interested in), the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as male 20% of the time (given that their error rate is 20%).

So, the probability that the witness identifies a male as male (our event of interest) is 0.8 (80%). The probability that the witness identifies a female as male (our complementary event) is 0.2 * 0.85 (20% error rate * 0.85 female population proportion).

The overall probability that the witness identifies a male as male (given that the attacker is actually male) is the sum of these two probabilities:

Probability = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.97 (97%).
