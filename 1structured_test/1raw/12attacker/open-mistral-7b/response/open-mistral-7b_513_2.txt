To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know whether the witness's error in this case was misidentifying a male as female or a female as male, we can assume the error rate is symmetric (i.e., 10% error for each gender).

Given that 85% of the city's population is female, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the attacker being misidentified as male would occur with a probability of 0.20.

However, since we don't know whether the witness's error was in this case or not, we should consider both scenarios:
1) The attacker is female, and the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male: Probability of this scenario is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (17%)
2) The attacker is male, and the witness correctly identifies the attacker: Probability of this scenario is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 (12%)

The sum of these two probabilities represents the total probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender, which is 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29 (29%).

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, we can subtract the total probability of the correct identification from 1 to find the probability of the attacker being male: 1 - 0.29 = 0.71 (71%)

So, according to this analysis, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.71.
