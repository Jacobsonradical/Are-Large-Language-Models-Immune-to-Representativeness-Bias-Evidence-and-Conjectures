To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's gender identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis being true (in this case, the probability that the attacker is male).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence being observed (in this case, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male).
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (in this case, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male).

From the information provided, we know the following:
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(H) = ? (this is what we want to find)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ¬H) * P(¬H)

Where ¬H means the attacker is not male. From information b, we know that P(¬H) = 0.15 (the population is 85% female).

To find P(E | ¬H), we need to know the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female. From the information provided, we don't have this number, so we can't calculate P(E) directly.

However, we can use the fact that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time to infer that they incorrectly identify gender 20% of the time. So we can assume that P(E | ¬H) = 0.2.

Since we can't calculate P(E) directly, we can't directly calculate P(H) using Bayes' theorem. However, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and that the population is 85% female, it seems likely that the witness is more likely to be correct when identifying a female than a male. This is because there are more females in the population, and the witness is more likely to have had more experience identifying females.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that P(H) is less than 0.15. However, without more information, we can't calculate an exact value.

So, the answer is:
{probability: an estimate less than 0.15, but we cannot provide a precise number}
