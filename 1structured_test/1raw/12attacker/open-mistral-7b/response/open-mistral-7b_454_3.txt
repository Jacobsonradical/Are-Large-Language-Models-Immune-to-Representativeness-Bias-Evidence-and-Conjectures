To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the actual gender distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying genders.

1. The actual gender distribution in the city: We know that 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's accuracy in identifying genders: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

a) The attacker is actually male. In this case, the probability is the actual proportion of male individuals in the city, which is 15%.

b) The witness made an error and the attacker is actually female. In this case, the probability is the actual proportion of female individuals in the city, which is 85%, multiplied by the probability of the witness erring, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

So, the probability of the witness making an error and the attacker being female is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios:

probability = 0.15 (attacker is male) + 0.17 (attacker is female and witness is mistaken) = 0.32 (or 32%)

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.32, or 32%.
