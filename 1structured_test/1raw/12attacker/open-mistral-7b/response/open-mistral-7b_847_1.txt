Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male based on two factors: the witness's reliability in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

First, let's consider the witness's reliability. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a male, they correctly identify him as male 80% of the time, and when they see a female, they incorrectly identify her as male 20% of the time.

Second, let's consider the gender distribution in the city. We know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the city's gender distribution. We can do this by considering the following two scenarios:

1. The witness correctly identified the attacker as male. In this case, the attacker must be male, and the probability of this happening is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, which is 0.8 (80%).

2. The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male. In this case, the attacker must be female, but the witness mistakenly identified her as male. The probability of this happening is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 0.2 (20%).

The overall probability that the attacker is male is the sum of these two probabilities, weighted by the likelihood of each scenario. The likelihood of the first scenario (correct identification) is higher than the likelihood of the second scenario (incorrect identification), so we can expect the overall probability to be closer to 0.8 than to 0.2.

To calculate the exact probability, we multiply the probability of each scenario by its likelihood and sum the results:

P(attacker is male) = P(witness correctly identifies male) * P(attacker is male given correct identification) + P(witness incorrectly identifies male) * P(attacker is male given incorrect identification)

P(witness correctly identifies male) = 0.8 (80%)
P(attacker is male given correct identification) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified a male)
P(witness incorrectly identifies male) = 0.2 (20%)
P(attacker is male given incorrect identification) = 0 (since the witness incorrectly identified a female)

P(attacker is male) = (0.8) * (1) + (0.2) * (0) = 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (80%). This means that, given the witness's statement and the city's gender distribution, we estimate that there is an 80% chance that the attacker is male.
