To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in judging gender and the gender distribution in the population.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the witness's error was in favor of identifying the attacker as male or female, we need to consider both possibilities.

1. If the witness was correct in their initial identification, the attacker is indeed male. The probability of this happening is 0.8 (the witness's correct rate).

2. If the witness was incorrect, the attacker is not male but was mistakenly identified as such. The probability of this happening is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

However, given that 85% of the population is female, it's more likely that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker as male. So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's error, is 0.15 (the proportion of males in the population).

To find the overall probability that the attacker is male, we need to account for both scenarios:

Probability of attacker being male = Probability of witness being correct * Probability of attacker being male given witness being correct + Probability of witness being incorrect * Probability of attacker being male given witness being incorrect

Probability of witness being correct = 0.8
Probability of attacker being male given witness being correct = 1
Probability of witness being incorrect = 0.2
Probability of attacker being male given witness being incorrect = 0.15

Probability of attacker being male = 0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.83, or 83%.
