To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness's error rate is 20%, and they correctly identified the gender 80% of the time. This means that for a random person in the city, the chance of being misidentified as the other gender by this witness is 0.2.

The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Now, let's calculate the probability of an attacker being misidentified as male by the witness, given that they are actually male:

1. The probability of a random person being male is 0.15.
2. The probability of being misidentified as female by the witness is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).
3. So, the probability of not being misidentified as female by the witness, given that the person is male, is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
4. The probability of this specific person (who is actually male) being identified as male by the witness is the product of the probabilities in steps 2 and 3: 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16.

Now, let's calculate the probability of an attacker being misidentified as male by the witness, given that they are female:

1. The probability of a random person being female is 0.85.
2. The probability of being misidentified as male by the witness is also 0.2 (the witness's error rate).
3. The probability of not being misidentified as male by the witness, given that the person is female, is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
4. The probability of this specific person (who is actually female) being identified as male by the witness is the product of the probabilities in steps 2 and 3: 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16.

Since we assume that the witness's ability to judge gender is consistent, the probabilities for a male and a female attacker being misidentified should be equal. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is equal to the probability that the attacker is misidentified as male, which is 0.16.
