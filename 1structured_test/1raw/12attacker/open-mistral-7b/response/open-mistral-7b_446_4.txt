To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- p: the probability that the attacker is male
- q: the probability that the attacker is female (1 - p)
- e: the error rate in gender identification by the witness (20%)

Given that the witness correctly identified the gender in 80% of cases, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is p * (1 - e) = p * (1 - 0.2) = 0.8p.

Since the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of the attacker being female in this city is q = 0.15.

The probability that the witness mistakes a female attacker for a male is e * q = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a female attacker is (1 - e) * q = (1 - 0.2) * 0.15 = 0.12.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the possible scenarios are either the witness correctly identified a male attacker (probability 0.8p) or mistakenly identified a female attacker (probability 0.03). Therefore, we can express the probability that the attacker is male as the sum of these two probabilities:

p = 0.8p + 0.03

Solving for p, we get:

p = 0.03 / (1 - 0.8) = 0.03 / 0.2 = 0.15

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 15%. However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate based on the given information, and actual probabilities may differ in real-world scenarios.
