To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male
- P(H): the prior probability of the hypothesis (i.e., the probability that the attacker is male before considering the evidence)
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (i.e., the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker)
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (i.e., the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male)
- P(~H): the prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis (i.e., the probability that the attacker is female)

From the information given, we have:
- P(H) = proportion of males in the population
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (from the witness's performance)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (from the witness's performance)
- P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where P(E) is the probability of the evidence, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

So,

P(E) = 0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * 0.15

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 * P(H)) / (0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * 0.15)

Since we don't have a specific value for P(H), we can substitute it with the population statistics:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.15)

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.267

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.267 or 26.7%.
