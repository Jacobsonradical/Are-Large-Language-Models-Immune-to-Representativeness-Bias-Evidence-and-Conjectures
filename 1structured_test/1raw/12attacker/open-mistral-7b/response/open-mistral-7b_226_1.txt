To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. This means that they correctly identify gender 80% of the time (100% - 20%).

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male as follows:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8 (their accuracy) * 0.15 (the proportion of males in the city).
2. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.8 * 0.85 (their accuracy) * 0.5 (the proportion of females in the city).

Since the witness reported that the attacker was male, we are interested in the probability of the first scenario (correctly identifying a male).
