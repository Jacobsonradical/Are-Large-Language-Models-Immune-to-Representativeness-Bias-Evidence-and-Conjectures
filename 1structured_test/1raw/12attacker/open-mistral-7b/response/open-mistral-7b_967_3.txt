Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80% with an error rate of 20%.
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states the probability of an event A given the occurrence of event B is equal to the probability of event B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A divided by the probability of B. In this case, A is the attacker being male and B is the witness's identification.

Let P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to find.
Let P(B|A) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (from the first piece of information).
Let P(B|non-A) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male, which is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a non-male as male).
Let P(A|B) be the probability we are interested in, which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|non-A) * P(non-A))

To compute P(non-A), we can use the given population distribution: P(non-A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.03 * 0.85)

To solve for P(A|B), we can rearrange the equation:

P(A|B) * (0.85) = 0.8 * P(A)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.85

Now we have an equation for P(A|B) in terms of P(A). To find a reasonable estimate for P(A|B), we can assume that P(A) is close to 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male from the population distribution). We can try different values of P(A) and see how they affect the resulting value of P(A|B):

If P(A) = 0.15, then P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.176
If P(A) = 0.1, then P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.1 / 0.85 ≈ 0.106
If P(A) = 0.2, then P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.2 / 0.85 ≈ 0.235

Based on these calculations, it seems that the prior probability of the attacker being male impacts the estimated probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification. However, the witness's ability to accurately identify gender (80%) suggests that the attacker's gender might be more likely to be male than the population distribution suggests. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for P(A|B) might be around 0.2.

So, {probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
