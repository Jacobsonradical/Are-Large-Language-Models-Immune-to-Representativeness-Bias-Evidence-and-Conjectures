Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. However, a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender and has a 20% error rate identified the attacker as male.

The witness's statement increases the probability that the attacker is male, but it does not completely eliminate the possibility that the attacker is female, given the high female population in the city.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probabilistic formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement. The prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)) is the probability of the attacker being male in the population. The likelihood of the evidence (P(E|H)) is the probability that the witness would make the observation given that the hypothesis is true.

We are given that the population is 85% female and 15% male, so P(H) = 0.15. We are also given that the witness is 80% accurate and 20% erroneous, so P(E|H) = 0.8.

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E), where P(E) is the probability of the evidence occurring regardless of the hypothesis. In this case, P(E) is the probability that the witness would make the observation (identify the attacker as male) if the attacker were female.

Since the witness is 80% accurate, we can estimate P(E|not H) = 0.2. However, we do not have enough information to accurately compute P(E), so we cannot directly apply Bayes' theorem.

Instead, we can make an approximation. Since the witness is more likely to err when the attacker is female (given the high female population), we might expect P(E) to be slightly lower than 0.5. If we assume that P(E) = 0.45 (slightly less than 0.5), then we can estimate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.45 â‰ˆ 0.22

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.22 (or 22%). However, this estimate is based on several assumptions and may not be very accurate. A more precise estimate would require more information, such as the actual probability of the witness making an observation given that the attacker is female.
