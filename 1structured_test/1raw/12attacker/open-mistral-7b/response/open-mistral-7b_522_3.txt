To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. Since we don't have information about whether the witness made more errors in identifying males or females, let's assume that the error rate is evenly distributed between the two genders for simplicity. This means that the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male 10% of the time (1 - 0.8 = 0.2 / 2 = 0.1) and a male as female 10% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of the attacker being male is the proportion of times the witness identifies a person as male and correctly identifies them as such. This can be computed as:

probability = (number of times witness correctly identifies male) / (total number of people)

The total number of people is the sum of the number of times the witness correctly identifies male and female, plus the number of times the witness makes an error in identifying males as females.

number of times witness correctly identifies male = 0.8 * 0.15 * population_size
number of times witness makes an error in identifying males as females = 0.1 * 0.85 * population_size

So, the probability of the attacker being male is:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85), please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This simplifies to:

{probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
