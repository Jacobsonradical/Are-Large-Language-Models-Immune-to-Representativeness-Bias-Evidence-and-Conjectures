Given the information provided, we have two sources of information: the general population demographics and the witness's ability to accurately identify gender.

1. According to the general population demographics, 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80% (correctly identifying gender) and 20% (erring in gender identification).

However, the witness's statement that the attacker is male contradicts the 85% female population. This contradiction suggests that the witness's identification might not be accurate in this specific case.

Since the witness's accuracy rate is 80%, and we cannot assume that the witness is correct in this instance due to the contradiction, we can calculate the probability that the witness is incorrect in this case.

Probability that the witness is incorrect = 1 - Probability that the witness is correct
                                                     = 1 - 0.8
                                                     = 0.2

Now, since the attacker could be either male or female, we can calculate the probability of each gender given the witness's incorrect identification.

1. The probability of the attacker being female, given the witness's incorrect identification:
   Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, the attacker must be female. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of an attacker being female, given the witness's incorrect identification, is 0.85 (85%).

2. The probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's incorrect identification:
   Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, and since 85% of the population is female, the probability of an attacker being male, given the witness's incorrect identification, is 0.15 (15%).

Since the witness's identification might not be accurate, we should consider both probabilities. However, given that the general population demographics contradict the witness's statement, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's incorrect identification, might be lower than 0.15.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strictly numerical estimate, but based on the information provided, it seems likely that the attacker is female.
