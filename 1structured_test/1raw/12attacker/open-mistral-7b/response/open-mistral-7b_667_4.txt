Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes how to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification, and our belief is the prior probability of the attacker being male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F) = 1 - P(M).

According to Bayes' theorem, P(M|witness_identification) = [P(witness_identification|M) * P(M)] / [P(witness_identification|M) * P(M) + P(witness_identification|F) * P(F)].

From the information given, we know that P(witness_identification|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time), P(witness_identification|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female 20% of the time), P(M) = ? (the probability we are trying to estimate), and P(F) = 1 - P(M).

Given that the population is 85% female and 15% male, we have P(F) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(M|witness_identification):

P(M|witness_identification) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(M|witness_identification) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, given the witness's identification and the population data, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
