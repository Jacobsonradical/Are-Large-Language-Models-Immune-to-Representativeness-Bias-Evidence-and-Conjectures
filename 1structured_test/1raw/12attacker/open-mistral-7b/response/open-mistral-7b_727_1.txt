Given the information provided, there are two sources of probability we need to consider: the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. Population distribution: The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. This means the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

2. Witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed between misidentifying males as females and females as males, then the probability of the witness misidentifying a male as a female is 0.20/2 = 0.10.

However, we cannot directly apply this error rate to our case because the witness saw the attacker from behind and under poor lighting conditions, which might have made gender identification more challenging. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the witness's error rate in this specific situation could be higher than 20%.

Given that we cannot quantify this increased error rate, it's difficult to provide a precise probability estimate. However, we can make an educated guess that the witness's identification of the attacker as male might not accurately reflect the attacker's true gender. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, based solely on the witness's testimony, might be lower than 0.15.

In conclusion, while we cannot provide a strict probability estimate, it seems reasonable to suggest that the probability of the attacker being male might be lower than 0.15, considering the city's population distribution and the potential limitations of the witness's ability to accurately identify gender in the given circumstances.

{probability: less than 0.15, but a precise number cannot be provided due to the lack of sufficient data}
