To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since we don't have information about the gender of the actual attacker, let's assume two cases:

a) The attacker is female: In this case, the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male 20% of the time.
b) The attacker is male: In this case, the attacker's gender matches the witness's identification 80% of the time.

Given the witness's statement that the attacker is male, we can assume that the attacker is male in case b). The probability of this case occurring is the probability that the attacker is male in the population.

Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male. Then, we have two equations:

a) P(M) * 0.8 + P(F) * 0.2 = 1 (where P(F) is the probability that the attacker is female)
b) P(M) = 0.8 (given the witness's statement)

We can solve for P(F) from equation a:

P(F) = (1 - 0.8) / 0.2 = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.8, and the probability that the attacker is male is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

However, since the witness's statement that the attacker is male is consistent with the attacker being male, we should use the witness's statement as the estimate. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is 0.8 (80%), which is the witness's accuracy in identifying males.
