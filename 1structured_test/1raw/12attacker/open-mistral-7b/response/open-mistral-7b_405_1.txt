Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.
2. The ratio of males to females in the city is 15% to 85%.

However, we should note that the witness's accuracy is not necessarily representative of the city's population distribution. The witness may have a bias towards identifying people as male or female, or their accuracy might be influenced by other factors unrelated to the actual gender distribution in the city.

Despite this, we can still make an estimate based on the witness's accuracy and the city's gender ratio. Let's assume that the witness's accuracy is independent of the city's gender ratio and that the gender ratio in the city affects only the true gender of the attacker (not the witness's ability to identify it).

In this scenario, the probability of the attacker being male would be the ratio of males in the city multiplied by the witness's probability of correctly identifying a male.

So, the probability of the attacker being male is:

(Percentage of males in the city) * (Witness's accuracy in identifying males) = (15%) * (0.8) = 0.12 or 12%

However, considering the caveats mentioned earlier, this is just an approximation and may not accurately reflect the true probability. It's always important to consider the context and potential biases when interpreting such data.
