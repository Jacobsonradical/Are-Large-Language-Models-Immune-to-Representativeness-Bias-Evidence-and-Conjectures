To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the witness is making a random guess with no information, they would get it right 50% of the time (half the time they would guess female and half the time they would guess male). Since they are getting it right 80% of the time, they must be incorporating some information into their guesses.

However, the witness was not perfectly accurate, so we can't simply assume that they are always correct. In this case, it seems reasonable to assume that their guesses are influenced by some degree of bias. Given that 85% of the population is female, it's likely that the witness has a bias towards identifying people as female.

To account for this bias, we can adjust the witness's accuracy rate. If we assume that the witness's actual accuracy rate is lower than 80%, then the fact that they identified the attacker as male is less surprising.

On the other hand, if we assume that the witness's actual accuracy rate is higher than 80%, then the fact that they identified the attacker as male is more surprising. However, this seems less likely, given that they were not perfectly accurate.

Given these considerations, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer without more information. However, we can make an educated guess based on the available information.

Since the witness is more likely to identify people as female, it's possible that they were actually less than 80% accurate in identifying males. If we assume that their actual accuracy rate for identifying males is lower than 80%, then the fact that they identified the attacker as male is less surprising.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to estimate that the probability that the attacker is male is lower than 80%, but higher than 15%. Without more information, it's difficult to provide a more precise estimate.
