Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness, who has a 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the witness has an 80% success rate in identifying gender and makes errors 20% of the time.
2. Since the city's population is 85% female, we would expect a female attacker to be misidentified as male by the witness 20% of the time (given the witness's error rate).
3. This means that out of 100 female attackers, 80 would be correctly identified as female, and 20 would be incorrectly identified as male by the witness.
4. However, since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that the actual attacker is not a female misidentified as male.
5. Therefore, the number of male attackers that could have been misidentified as female by the witness is equal to the number of female attackers misidentified as male.
6. Given that 20 female attackers are misidentified as male, there must be 20 male attackers misidentified as female.
7. But since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are actually 20 more male attackers in the city than the number of male attackers misidentified as female.
8. So, the number of male attackers in the city is 20 more than the number of female attackers misidentified as male.
9. Since there are 20 female attackers misidentified as male, there must be 40 (20 + 20) male attackers in the city.
10. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 40/100 or 0.4, which is 40%.

In summary: {probability: 0.4}
