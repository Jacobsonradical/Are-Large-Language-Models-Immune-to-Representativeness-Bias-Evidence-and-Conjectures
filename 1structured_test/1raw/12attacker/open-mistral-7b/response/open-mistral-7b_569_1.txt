Given the information provided, let's reason through the problem:

1. We have a witness who is able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male, but we don't know if this identification was correct or not.

Let's represent the probability P(M) that the attacker is male and P(F) that the attacker is female. We know that P(M) + P(F) = 1.

The witness's statement that the attacker is male can be true (P(M)) or false (P(F)). In the case that the witness's statement is true, the attacker is actually male, so P(M|M) = 1. In the case that the witness's statement is false, the attacker is actually female, so P(F|M) = 0.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(M) = [P(M|M) * P(M)] / [P(M|M) * P(M) + P(M|F) * P(F)]

We know P(M|M) = 1, P(M) = x (we want to find this value), P(F) = 1 - x, P(M|F) = 0, and P(F) = 0.15.

So, the equation becomes: x = (1 * x) / [(1 * x) + (0 * 0.15)]

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2/3

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 2/3, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
