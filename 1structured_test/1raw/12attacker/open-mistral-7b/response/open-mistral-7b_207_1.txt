To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender composition of the city's population.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(female).

Given the witness's error rate, we can express the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female as:

P(witness_misidentifies_male) = 0.2

Given the gender composition of the city's population, we can express the probability of the witness seeing a female as:

P(female) = 0.85

Since the witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time, the probability of the witness seeing a male and incorrectly identifying him as female is:

P(witness_sees_male_and_misidentifies) = P(male) * 0.2

Since the witness correctly identifies 80% of the time, the probability of the witness seeing a male and correctly identifying him is:

P(witness_sees_male_and_correctly_identifies) = P(male) * 0.8

The probability of the witness identifying a male, regardless of whether they correctly or incorrectly identify him, is the sum of both probabilities:

P(witness_identifies_male) = P(witness_sees_male_and_correctly_identifies) + P(witness_sees_male_and_misidentifies)

P(witness_identifies_male) = (P(male) * 0.8) + (P(male) * 0.2)

P(witness_identifies_male) = 1.0 * P(male)

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we know that:

P(witness_identifies_male) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time)

So we can solve for P(male):

P(male) = 0.8 / 1.0 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 or 80%.
