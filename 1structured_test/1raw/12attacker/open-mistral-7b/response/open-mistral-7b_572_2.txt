Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

a) The witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80%, with an error rate of 20%.
b) The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

However, the witness's statement (a) is not directly applicable to the city's population (b), as the witness's accuracy rate may not be the same when judging gender in a more diverse population. Therefore, we cannot directly use the witness's accuracy rate to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

To address this, we could make an assumption that the witness's ability to judge gender is independent of the population composition. Under this assumption, the probability that the witness identifies a male as male would be equal to the probability of the attacker being male in the population, which is 15%.

Since the witness's error rate is 20%, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female would be 20% * 15% = 0.03 or 3%.

However, the statement (a) mentions that the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time, which means that the probability of the witness correctly identifying a female as female would also be 80%. Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability that the witness identifies a female as female would be 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68 or 68%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, and given our assumption that the witness's ability to judge gender is independent of the population composition, the probability that the attacker is male in the population would be equal to the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is 15%.

However, this assumption might not hold true, and the actual probability could be different. Therefore, I would recommend further investigation, such as more witnesses or other evidence, to obtain a more accurate estimate.

{probability: 0.15, please note that this is an estimate based on an assumption that might not hold true}
