Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80%, with an error rate of 20%. However, we do not have information about the gender distribution of the attacker specifically. We only know that in the city, 85% of the population is female and 15% is male (information "b").

Without knowing the exact gender distribution of the attackers in the population, it's not possible to directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to estimate the probability of the attacker being male. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific probability estimate in this case.
