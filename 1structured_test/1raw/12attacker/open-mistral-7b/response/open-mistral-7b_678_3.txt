Given the information provided, we have two pieces of evidence:

1. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in determining gender, identified the attacker as male.

However, we should consider that the witness's identification might be incorrect due to the limited visibility and lighting conditions during the night. Since the witness was incorrect 20% of the time, we cannot entirely rely on this piece of evidence.

So, to calculate the probability that the attacker is male based on the population statistics, we can use the following formula:

P(Attacker is Male) = Population proportion of males
                                     = 0.15

However, since we cannot ignore the witness's statement, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, A represents the attacker being male and B represents the witness identifying the attacker as male.

P(A) = 0.15 (from population statistics)
P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness was correct in this case)
P(B) = 0.8 (since the witness was incorrect in 20% of the cases)

Using these values, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / (0.8) = 0.1875

The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.1875 or 18.75%. This is significantly lower than the population proportion, suggesting that the witness's statement might be an error due to the poor lighting conditions. Therefore, it would be prudent to consider both pieces of evidence and make a more nuanced assessment.
