To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given in both the witness's ability to identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. This means that for a random person, the probability of the witness correctly identifying them as male is 0.8, and the probability of incorrectly identifying them as male is 0.2.

2. According to the information provided, 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.

Now, let's combine these two pieces of information. When the witness identifies someone as male, the probability that they are correct is 0.8, and when they identify someone as female, the probability that they are incorrect is 0.2 (since they would be identifying a male as female).

The probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified them as male is the probability of the witness being correct in this specific case. This can be calculated as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male multiplied by the probability of the attacker being male in the population.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8, and the probability of the attacker being male in the population is 0.15 (15%).

So, the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified them as male is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%.

However, we need to consider that the witness might have made an error and incorrectly identified the attacker as male. In this case, the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified them as male is the probability of the witness being incorrect (erring in identifying a female as male) multiplied by the probability of the attacker being male in the population.

The probability of the witness being incorrect is 0.2, and the probability of the attacker being male in the population is 0.15.

So, the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified them as male and the witness might have made an error is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03, or 3%.

In conclusion, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is either 12% or 3%, depending on whether we consider the possibility of the witness making an error or not. Since we cannot know for certain whether the witness made an error, a more conservative estimate would be the lower probability of 3%.
