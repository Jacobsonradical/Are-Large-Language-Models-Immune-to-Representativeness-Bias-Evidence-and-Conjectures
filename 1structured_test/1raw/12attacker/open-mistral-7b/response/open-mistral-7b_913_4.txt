To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

From the population distribution, we know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male. However, since the witness mistakenly identified a person's gender 20% of the time, we must account for this error.

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and their error rate is 20%. When the witness is presented with a person who is actually male (15% of the population), they will correctly identify this person as male 80% of the time. But they will also mistakenly identify a female as male 20% of the time, assuming there are equal numbers of females and males in the sample.

So, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male (actual male) is 0.80. However, we also need to account for the cases where the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male. Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of selecting a female is 0.85.

The witness mistakenly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, so the probability of this happening is 0.20. This means that when the witness sees a female (which makes up 85% of the population), they will mistakenly identify her as male 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17% of the time.

Now, when the witness identifies a person as male, we need to consider whether they are correct or mistaken. The probability of the witness being correct is 0.80, and the probability of the witness being mistaken is 0.17 (when they see a female and mistake her for a male).

So, the probability of the witness being correct, given that they identified a person as male, is 0.80 / (0.80 + 0.17) = 0.82 or 82%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can use this probability to estimate the probability that the attacker is actually male. Since the witness is correct 82% of the time when they identify someone as male, we can assume that the attacker is male with a probability of 0.82.
