To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an informed guess.

Given the witness's ability to correctly identify gender, we can calculate the probability of them mistakenly identifying a male as female. Since they are correct 80% of the time, they are incorrect 20% of the time. This means that for every 100 people they identify, they will incorrectly identify 20 as females.

Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the proportion of mistakes that would be made if the attacker was actually female. For every 100 people, there would be 85 females and 15 males. If the witness mistakes a male for a female, they are adding an error to the female count. So, if they make 20 mistakes, they are adding an extra 15 male "mistakes" to the female count, making it seem like there are more females than there actually are.

The total number of females in the population is 85, and if the witness adds 15 "male mistakes" to this, it makes it seem like there are 100 females. So, the actual number of females is 85 - 15 = 70.

Given that the witness identifies the attacker as male, they must have made a mistake in their gender identification. The question is, what is the probability that they made a mistake by identifying a female as male?

Let's denote the probability of the witness making a mistake when identifying a female as p. The probability of making a mistake when identifying a male is 1 - p, since they are correct 80% of the time.

We know that for every 100 people, the witness makes 20 mistakes. These 20 mistakes can be divided into two types: mistakes where they identify a male as female, and mistakes where they identify a female as male. Since there are 15 males, the number of mistakes made on males is 15 * (1 - p).

Given that there are 85 females, the number of mistakes made on females is 85 * p.

Since there are a total of 100 people and the witness makes 20 mistakes, we have the equation:

15 * (1 - p) + 85 * p = 20

We can solve this equation for p:

p = 20 / (85 + 15)
p = 20 / 100
p = 0.2

So, the probability that the witness made a mistake by identifying a female as male is 0.2. This means that the probability that the attacker is female, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is 0.2.

Since the population is 85% female, and the witness made a mistake, it means that the actual proportion of females in the population is less than 85%. The proportion of females is reduced by the probability that the witness made a mistake, which is 0.2.

So, the proportion of females in the population, after accounting for the witness's mistake, is 0.85 - 0.2 = 0.65.

Since there are 100 people in total, there are 0.65 * 100 = 65 females.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, and there are 65 females in the population, the probability that the attacker is male is the probability that the witness was correct in identifying a male, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8.
