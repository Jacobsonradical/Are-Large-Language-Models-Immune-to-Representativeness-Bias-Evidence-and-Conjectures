To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence: the witness's statement and the gender distribution in the city

The Bayes' theorem formula is:
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

We are given:
- P(E|H): the probability that the witness makes the statement given that the attacker is male. This is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, which is 0.8 (from the first piece of information).
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being male. This is the probability of drawing a male from the population, which is 0.15 (from the second piece of information, since 85% of the population is female).
- P(E): the probability of the evidence. This is the probability of the witness making the statement, considering both that the attacker is male and that the attacker is female.

To find P(E), we can use the total probability formula:
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Here, ~H means not H, i.e., the attacker is female. P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness makes the statement given that the attacker is female. Since the witness's ability to judge gender is not perfect, this probability is different from 0.

Unfortunately, the information does not provide us with the value of P(E|~H). Without this value, we cannot directly calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem. However, we can still make an estimate.

Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, and there are more females in the city, it's likely that the witness would have a harder time identifying a male attacker. Therefore, we can assume that P(E|~H) is less than 0.8, possibly much less. This would mean that P(H|E) is higher than 0.15, the prior probability.

However, without a specific value for P(E|~H), we cannot provide a precise probability estimate. We can only say that, given the information, it's more likely than not that the attacker is male.

{probability: greater than 0.15, but we cannot provide a precise number}
