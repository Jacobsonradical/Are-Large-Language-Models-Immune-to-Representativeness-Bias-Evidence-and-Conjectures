To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's reliability in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M). The probability of the witness misidentifying a female as male is 20% (from point a), and the probability of the witness misidentifying a male as female is also 20% (since the gender distribution is balanced).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:
1) The attacker is actually male (P(M))
2) The witness misidentified a female as male (P(F) * 0.2)

We can write an equation using Bayes' theorem to find P(M):

P(M | witnessed_male) = [P(witnessed_male | M) * P(M)] / [P(witnessed_male | M) * P(M) + P(witnessed_male | F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the given probabilities:

P(M | witnessed_male) = [0.8 * P(M)] / [0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * (1 - P(M))]

Since 85% of the population is female (point b), P(F) = 0.15.

Now, we can solve for P(M):

P(M | witnessed_male) = [0.8 * P(M)] / [0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * 0.15]

Simplifying and solving for P(M):

P(M | witnessed_male) = 10/11

Since the probability must be between 0 and 1, it seems there might be an error in the provided information or the calculations. The given witness's reliability in identifying gender leads to a probability greater than 1, which is not possible. It would be best to reevaluate the information or assumptions.

Final answer: {probability: 10/11, please note that the result might not be valid due to inconsistent or incorrect information provided}
