Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, our hypothesis is "The attacker is male" (H), and our evidence is "The witness identified the attacker as male" (E).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. This is what we want to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. This is given as 80% in the first piece of information.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male. This is the probability of the attacker being male before considering any evidence.
- P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender.

P(E) is not directly given in the information, but we can calculate it using the information about the gender distribution in the city and the witness's error rate.

The witness errs in 20% of the cases, so the probability of correctly identifying the gender is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. Since there are equal numbers of males and females in the sample, the probability of a randomly chosen person being female is 0.5, and the probability of a randomly chosen person being male is 0.5.

So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

Since the witness identifies a male 0.8 of the time and a female as a male 0.1 of the time, and there are equal numbers of males and females, the probability of the witness identifying a person as male, regardless of the person's gender, is 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.6.

So, P(E) = 0.6.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
    = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.6
    = 0.4 / 0.6
    = 2/3

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 2/3, or approximately 0.67.
