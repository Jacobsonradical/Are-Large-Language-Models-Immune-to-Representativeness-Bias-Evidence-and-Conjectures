To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

From the information provided, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't have specific information about how often the witness makes a mistake in identifying a male as male or a female as male.

Let's assume for now that the witness's error rate is the same for both males and females (this is an assumption and may not be accurate). In that case, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male is 0.8.

Since the attacker's gender was not visible to the victim, we can treat this as a random event with two possible outcomes: male or female. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of this event happening is P(male) * 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time).

However, we also know that the witness made an error in 20% of the cases. So, the probability of the witness reporting a male attacker when the actual attacker was female is 0.15 * 0.2 (since there's a 15% chance of a female attacker and the witness errs 20% of the time).

The total probability of the witness reporting a male attacker under both conditions (correct identification and error) is P(male) * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2.

Since the witness reported a male attacker, this total probability should be greater than or equal to the observed probability: 0.8 (the witness's reported probability of a male attacker).

Therefore, the inequality we have is: P(male) * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2 ≥ 0.8

Solving this inequality for P(male), we get: P(male) ≥ 0.64

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is at least 0.64. This estimate is quite high, considering that 85% of the city's population is female. This suggests that the witness's gender identification may not be as reliable as assumed, especially when conditions are poor.
