To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

A) The witness correctly identified a male attacker.
B) The witness mistakenly identified a female attacker as male.

The probability of scenario A is the actual proportion of male attackers in the population times the witness's accuracy in identifying males. The probability of scenario B is the proportion of female attackers in the population times the witness's error rate in identifying females as males.

a) Probability of scenario A: 15% (male population proportion) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12 (or 12%)

b) Probability of scenario B: 85% (female population proportion) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17 (or 17%)

Since we cannot have both scenarios A and B happening at the same time (the attacker is either male or female), we add the probabilities of both scenarios to find the total probability:

0.12 (scenario A) + 0.17 (scenario B) = 0.29 (or 29%)

The probability estimate is that there is a 29% chance that the attacker is male, given the witness's gender identification and the city's population distribution.
