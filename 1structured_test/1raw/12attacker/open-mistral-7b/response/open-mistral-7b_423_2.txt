Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. However, we also have a witness who identified the attacker as male, but their accuracy in gender identification is only 80% under similar conditions, with a 20% error rate.

Since we cannot definitively say whether the witness was correct or not in this case, we should consider both possibilities: the attacker is male (correct identification by the witness) and the attacker is female (incorrect identification by the witness).

Let's calculate the probabilities for both scenarios:

1. If the attacker is male:
   - The probability of the witness being correct is 0.8 (given in the information).
   - So, the probability of the attacker being male and the witness being correct is 0.8 (probability of the attacker being male) * 1 (given that the witness is correct in this case) = 0.8

2. If the attacker is female:
   - The probability of the witness being incorrect is 0.2 (given in the information).
   - Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85 (probability of the attacker being female given that the population is 85% female).
   - So, the probability of the attacker being female and the witness being incorrect is 0.85 (probability of the attacker being female) * 0.2 (probability of the witness being incorrect in this case) = 0.17

Now, to find the overall probability of the attacker being male, we add the probabilities of the attacker being male and the witness being correct to the probabilities of the attacker being female and the witness being incorrect:

Overall probability of the attacker being male = 0.8 (probability of the attacker being male and the witness being correct) + 0.17 (probability of the attacker being female and the witness being incorrect) = 0.97

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is approximately 0.97 (or 97%). Keep in mind that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions, and the actual probability might be different.
