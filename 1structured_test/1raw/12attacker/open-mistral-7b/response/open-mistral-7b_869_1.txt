To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's reliability in gender identification is 80% (correctly identifying gender) and 20% (erring in gender identification).
2. The actual gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
3. Since we don't have any information suggesting that the attacker is more likely to be one gender over the other, we can assume that the attacker is equally likely to be male or female.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

1. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male is 20%.
2. Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability that the attacker is female and the witness incorrectly identifies them as male is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (or 17%).
3. The probability that the attacker is male is 1 - the probability that the attacker is female and the witness incorrectly identifies them as male = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%).

So, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.83}. This means that there's an 83% chance that the attacker is male.
