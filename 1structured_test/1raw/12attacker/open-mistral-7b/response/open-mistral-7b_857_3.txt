The probability estimate of the attacker being male, given the information provided, can be calculated as follows:

1. The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time.
2. In a city with an 85% female population, the probability of the witness seeing a female person is 0.85.
3. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%).
4. Since the attacker's gender is unknown, let's call the probability of the attacker being male "p".
5. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.
6. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, which is 0.83.

So, the probability estimate that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.83, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
