The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, the witness made an error in this case, identifying the attacker as male. Since we know that the attacker could not be identified by the victim, it means that the witness made an error in this case.

Given that the witness's error rate is 20%, the probability that the witness's identification was an error is 20%. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually female, given the witness's error, is 1 - the probability of the witness's error = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

However, we cannot ignore the fact that the city has a gender distribution of 85% female and 15% male. If the attacker was actually female and the witness made an error, it would be an error of commission, meaning the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male. In this case, the probability of such an error is lower than the overall error rate, given the city's gender distribution.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the city's gender distribution. We can do this by calculating the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male (a hit) and the probability of the witness making an error of commission (an error of commission).

The probability of a hit is the probability of the attacker being male (15%) times the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male (80%):

Probability of hit = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

The probability of an error of commission is the probability of the attacker being female (85%) times the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male (20%):

Probability of error of commission = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

The total probability of the witness's identification being correct or an error of commission is the sum of the probability of a hit and the probability of an error of commission:

Total probability = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

However, since the witness made an error in this case, the actual probability that the attacker is male is the probability of an error of commission, which is 0.17.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is: {probability: 0.17}
