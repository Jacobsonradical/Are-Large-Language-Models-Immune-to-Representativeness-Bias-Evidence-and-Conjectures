To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here,
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B. This is what we're trying to find out.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A. This is given as 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a male 80% of the time).
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A. This is the probability of the attacker being male in the population, which is given as 0.15 (15% of the population is male).
- P(B) is the probability of event B. This is the probability of the witness making the observation they did, which can be calculated using the witness's error rate. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, we can calculate P(B) as 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

So, the calculation would be:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.8) = 0.15

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15, or 15%. This means that, given the information we have, it is still more likely that the attacker was female, despite the witness's identification of the attacker as male. However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and real-world circumstances can sometimes deviate from statistical predictions.
