To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:

- P(M) as the prior probability that the attacker is male, which we want to find.
- P(F) as the prior probability that the attacker is female.
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male.
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.
- P(w) as the probability that the witness gives the statement that they saw a male.

We are given the following information:

1. P(M) + P(F) = 1
2. P(w|M) = 0.8
3. P(w|F) = 0.2
4. P(M) * P(w|M) + P(F) * P(w|F) = 0.8 (this is the probability that the witness states they saw a male, given that the attacker is either male or female)

We are also given that 85% of the population is female, so P(F) = 0.85. We can substitute this into the third equation to find P(M):

P(M) * P(w|M) = 0.8 - 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.06

So, P(M) = 0.06 / 0.8 = 0.075, or 7.5%.

However, this answer seems to contradict the witness's statement that they identified the attacker as male with 80% accuracy. If the prior probability of the attacker being male is only 7.5%, then the probability that the witness would correctly identify a male should be lower than 80%.

There seems to be an inconsistency in the information given. If the witness's statement can be trusted, then the prior probability of the attacker being male should be higher than 7.5%. If the prior probability of the attacker being male is 80%, then the probability that the witness would correctly identify a male should still be lower than 100%, due to the error rate of 20%.

Without a consistent set of information, it's not possible to provide a precise estimate.
