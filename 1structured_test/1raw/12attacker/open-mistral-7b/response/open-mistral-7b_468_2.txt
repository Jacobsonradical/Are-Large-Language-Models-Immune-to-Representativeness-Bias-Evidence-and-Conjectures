Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is male before considering any evidence)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability that the witness identified someone as male)

From the information given, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male, given that 85% of the population is female)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a female as male (this information is not given, so we'll assume it's the same as P(B|A) for simplicity)
  P(not A) = 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker being female)

Since P(B|not A) = 0.8 and P(not A) = 0.85, we can calculate P(B) as:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8
          = 0.125

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.125 or 12.5%.
