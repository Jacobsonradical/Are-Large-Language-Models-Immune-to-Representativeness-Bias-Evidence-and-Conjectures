To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. From the provided information, we know that 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, it means that the actual gender of the attacker was female 80% of the time when the witness said it was a male.
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually male is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, which is 20% (the error rate in the opposite direction).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.2} or 20%.
