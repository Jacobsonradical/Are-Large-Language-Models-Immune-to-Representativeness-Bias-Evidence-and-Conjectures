Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population demographics and the witness's testimony. The population demographics suggest a 15% chance that the attacker is male (information "a"). However, the witness's testimony, which is less reliable but still relevant, suggests a 80% chance that the attacker is male (information "b").

To estimate the overall probability that the attacker is male, we can assign respective weights to these two sources of evidence based on their reliability. Let's assume that the population demographics are more reliable than the witness's testimony (probably a reasonable assumption, given that they are objective data).

We can assign a weight of 0.7 to the population demographics and a weight of 0.3 to the witness's testimony. The weighted probability of the attacker being male can then be calculated as follows:

0.7 * 0.15 (probability from the demographics) + 0.3 * 0.8 (probability from the witness's testimony) = 0.105 + 0.24 = 0.345

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
