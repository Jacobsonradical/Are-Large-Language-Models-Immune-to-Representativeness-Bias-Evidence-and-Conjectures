Given the information provided, there are two main sources of information to consider: the city's demographic statistics and the witness's ability to accurately identify gender.

1. City Demographics: The city has an 85% female population and a 15% male population. This means that if the attacker was chosen at random from the city population, the probability of the attacker being male would be 0.15 (or 15%).

2. Witness's Ability: The witness was found to correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases. However, it's important to note that the witness misidentified the attacker as male, which means they erred in this specific case.

Since we don't have enough information to determine if the witness's error in this case was due to incorrectly identifying a female as male or incorrectly identifying a male as female, we cannot use the witness's ability to adjust the city demographic probability.

Therefore, based on the city demographics alone, we estimate that the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 (or 15%).
