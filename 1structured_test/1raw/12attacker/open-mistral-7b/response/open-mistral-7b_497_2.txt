To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can consider the information given and apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence (the witness's identification of the attacker as male)

The prior probability of the hypothesis H (P(H)) is the proportion of males in the city, which we know is 0.15 (from information "a").

The likelihood of the evidence E given the hypothesis H (P(E|H)) is the probability that the witness would correctly identify a male, which we know is 0.8 (from information "b").

The likelihood of the evidence E given the negation of the hypothesis H (P(E|~H)) is the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a male, which is 1 - P(E|H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (from information "b").

The prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis H (P(~H)) is the proportion of females in the city, which is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (from information "a").

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we find:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.24 or 24%.
