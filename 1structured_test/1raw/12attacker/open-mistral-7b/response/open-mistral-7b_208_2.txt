Given the information provided, the attacker's gender is initially unknown to us. However, we have two pieces of information that can influence our estimation:

1. The population distribution of genders in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who was able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both pieces of information. The first piece of information tells us the prior probability of an attacker being male in the general population. The second piece of information tells us the likelihood of the witness making the observed statement (identifying the attacker as male) given that the attacker is actually male.

Let's denote:
- p: the prior probability of an attacker being male (given by the population distribution)
- q: the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (from the witness's ability)
- r: the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male attacker as female (1 - q)

From the witness's statement, we know that the observed probability of the witness saying "male" given that the attacker is actually male is q, and the observed probability of the witness saying "male" given that the attacker is actually female is r. Since we know that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write the following Bayes' theorem equation:

p(male | witness statement) = (p * q) / (p * q + r * (1 - p))

We are given the prior probability p = 0.15 and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker q = 0.8. However, we don't have enough information to calculate the probability r (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male attacker as female).

Since the witness's ability to identify gender was assessed under conditions similar to that night, we can assume that r is likely to be relatively small (much smaller than q, considering the witness's high accuracy). However, without a concrete value for r, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate.

Therefore, the best we can do is give an upper bound for the probability that the attacker is male based on the witness's statement. Since r is likely to be small, the probability p(male | witness statement) should be close to p * q = 0.12 (which is a lower bound for the probability). As a rough estimate, we can take the upper bound around 0.15 (the prior probability of an attacker being male) or even higher, depending on how confident we are that r is small.

However, it is important to note that this estimate does not take into account any other relevant information or potential biases in the witness's statement. For a more accurate estimate, additional information or a more rigorous analysis would be required.

{probability: 0.15, please note that this is an upper bound estimate and a more accurate value could be obtained with more information}
