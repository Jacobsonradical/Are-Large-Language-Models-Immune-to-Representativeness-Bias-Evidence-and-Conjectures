To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. From the population distribution, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. According to the witness, they correctly identified the gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

Now, let's consider the likelihood of the witness's identification being correct given that the attacker is male:

- If the attacker is male, there is a 15% chance that the witness will correctly identify the gender (since 15% of the population is male).

Next, let's consider the likelihood of the witness's identification being correct given that the attacker is female:

- If the attacker is female, there is an 85% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify the gender as male (since 85% of the population is female).

Finally, we can calculate the overall probability of the witness's identification being correct by considering both scenarios:

- Probability of correct identification given a male attacker: 0.15
- Probability of incorrect identification given a female attacker: 0.85
- Probability of the witness's identification being correct: 0.15 * (correct probability) + 0.85 * (incorrect probability)

Since the witness incorrectly identified the gender, the incorrect probability is equal to the correct probability (0.80) for this situation.

- Probability of the witness's identification being correct: 0.15 * 0.80 + 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, is approximately 0.29 (or 29%).
