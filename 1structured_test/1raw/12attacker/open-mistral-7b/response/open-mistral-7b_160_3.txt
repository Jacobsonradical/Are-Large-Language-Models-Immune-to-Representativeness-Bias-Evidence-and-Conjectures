To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability as follows:

1. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is the error rate for males, which is 20% (0.2) according to the information provided.
2. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 1 minus the error rate for males, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
3. Since the city is 85% female and 15% male, the ratio of females to males is 85:15 or 17:3.
4. The probability of the attacker being male is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, multiplied by the ratio of males in the city, and divided by the total number of people in the city (which is 100%).

The calculation is as follows:

{probability: 0.8 * (15/100) / (85/100 + 15/100) = 0.12 or 12%}

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%. This means that, given the information provided, there is a 12% chance that the attacker is male.
