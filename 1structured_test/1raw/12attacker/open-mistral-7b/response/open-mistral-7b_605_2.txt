Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who has an accuracy rate of 80% in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male. However, we should consider the possibility of the witness making a mistake, as they were incorrect 20% of the time.

Given this information, we can't directly calculate the probability that the attacker is male based on the population statistics alone, since we're dealing with a single incident and not a large sample from the population. However, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake if the attacker is actually female.

Let P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female, and P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male. From the provided population statistics, P(F) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15.

The witness incorrectly identified a female as male with a probability of 0.2. So, P(Witness Mistake | Attacker is Female) = 0.2.

However, the witness correctly identified a male as male with a probability of 1. So, P(Witness Correct Identification | Attacker is Male) = 1.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of this event happening given that the attacker is male is P(Witness Correct Identification | Attacker is Male) = 1.

The probability of this event happening given that the attacker is female is P(Witness Mistake | Attacker is Female) = 0.2.

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification is:

P(M | Witness Identification) = P(Witness Correct Identification | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male) / [P(Witness Correct Identification | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male) + P(Witness Mistake | Attacker is Female) * P(Attacker is Female)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(M | Witness Identification) = 1 * 0.15 / [1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.15 / 0.22 = 0.6818

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.68 or 68%. This estimate takes into account the witness's accuracy rate and the gender distribution in the city.
