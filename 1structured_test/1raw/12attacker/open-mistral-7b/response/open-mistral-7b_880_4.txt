To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's errors are more likely to be misidentifying males as females or females as males. To account for this uncertainty, we'll assume an equal error rate and calculate the probability using both possibilities.

1. If the witness's errors are more likely to be misidentifying males as females:
   - Since the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the actual proportion of males in the city that the witness identifies as male is 0.8 * 0.15 + 1 * 0.2 = 0.24 (24%).
   - Given that 85% of the population is female, the actual proportion of females in the city is 0.85.
   - Since the witness identifies 80% of females as females, the proportion of females the witness identifies as females is 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68 (68%).
   - The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is then the proportion of males the witness identifies as male divided by the proportion of females the witness identifies as females, which is 0.24 / 0.68 ≈ 0.35 (35%).

2. If the witness's errors are more likely to be misidentifying females as males:
   - Since the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the actual proportion of males in the city that the witness identifies as male is 1 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.28 (28%).
   - Given that 85% of the population is female, the actual proportion of females in the city is 0.15.
   - Since the witness identifies 80% of females as females, the proportion of females the witness identifies as females is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).
   - The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is then the proportion of males the witness identifies as male divided by the proportion of females the witness identifies as females, which is 0.28 / 0.12 ≈ 0.23 (23%).

Since we cannot determine which error rate is more likely, we will take the average of the two estimates: (0.35 + 0.23) / 2 ≈ 0.295 (29.5%).
