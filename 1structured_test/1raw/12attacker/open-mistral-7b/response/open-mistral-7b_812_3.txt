To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

From the information given, we have:
- p(H): the prior probability of the attacker being male. Since we don't have any prior information, we can assume it's equal to the proportion of males in the population (15%). So p(H) = 0.15
- p(~H): the prior probability of the attacker being female. p(~H) = 1 - p(H) = 0.85
- p(E|H): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, given that the attacker is male. This is given as 0.8 in the text.
- p(E|~H): the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, given that the attacker is female. Since the witness mistakes females for males 20% of the time, p(E|~H) = 0.2

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification:

p(H|E) = [p(E|H) * p(H)] / [p(E|H) * p(H) + p(E|~H) * p(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

p(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

p(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.133

So, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 13.3%.
