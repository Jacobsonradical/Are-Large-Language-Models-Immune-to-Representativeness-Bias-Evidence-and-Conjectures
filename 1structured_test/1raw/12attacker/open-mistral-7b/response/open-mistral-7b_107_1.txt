Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

From the first piece of information, we know the prior probability of H, which is the probability of the attacker being male in the population: P(H) = 0.15.

From the second piece of information, we know the likelihood of E given H, which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male: P(E|H) = 0.8.

We also know the likelihood of E given not-H, which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male: P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, and there is an 85% chance that the attacker is female).

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of H given E, P(H|E), using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

P(H|E) ≈ 0.15 / 0.245 ≈ 0.61

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.61, or 61%.
