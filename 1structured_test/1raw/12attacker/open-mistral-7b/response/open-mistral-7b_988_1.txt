To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is the attacker being male, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male

Given that the witness's error rate is 20%, we can calculate P(w|F) as 1 - P(w|M). From the information provided, we have P(w|M) = 0.8 and P(w|F) = 0.2.

The city's gender population distribution is given as 85% female and 15% male. So, we can calculate P(M) and P(F) as follows:

P(M) = 0.15
P(F) = 0.85

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement:

P(M|w) = P(w|M) * P(M) / [P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M|w) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(M|w) = 0.12 / 0.12 + 0.17
P(M|w) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|w) = 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
