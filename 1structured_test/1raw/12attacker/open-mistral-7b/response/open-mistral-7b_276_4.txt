Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have the specific number of times the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender as male. We only know that they were correct 80% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, it would seem intuitive that the attacker is more likely to be female, given the population ratio. However, without more specific information, we cannot calculate a precise probability.

Therefore, I cannot provide a numerical estimate in the requested format.
