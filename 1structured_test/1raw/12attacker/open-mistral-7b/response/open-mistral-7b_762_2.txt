Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is not perfect in gender identification, identified the attacker as male. This witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since we don't have any information about the gender of the attacker being correctly identified or not, we can't directly apply the witness's error rate to this specific case. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

Let's denote:
- H0: The attacker is male
- H1: The attacker is female
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as male

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(H0|E) = [P(E|H0) * P(H0)] / [P(E|H0) * P(H0) + P(E|H1) * P(H1)]

We have:
- P(E|H0) = 1 (since in this case, the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender)
- P(H0) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is male in the population)
- P(E|H1) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male)
- P(H1) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is female in the population)

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement:

P(H0|E) = [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(H0|E) â‰ˆ 0.165

So, based on Bayes' theorem and the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 16.5%.
