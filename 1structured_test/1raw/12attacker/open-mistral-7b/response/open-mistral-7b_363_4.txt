To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of a random person in the city being male as P(Male). Since 85% of the population is female, the remaining 15% must be male. So, P(Male) = 0.15.

The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. When the witness correctly identifies a male, the actual gender matches the attacker's gender. When the witness errs, they might mistakenly identify a male as female, or vice versa.

To account for the witness's errors, we can calculate the probability of the witness's identification being correct, given that the actual gender is male.

P(Witness correctly identifies male | Attacker is male) = P(Witness correctly identifies) = 0.8

Similarly, the probability of the witness's identification being correct, given that the actual gender is female, is P(Witness incorrectly identifies female | Attacker is female) = P(Witness errs) = 0.2

Since the gender distribution is 85% female, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:

P(Attacker is male) = P(Attacker is male | Witness correctly identifies male) * P(Witness correctly identifies male) + P(Attacker is male | Witness incorrectly identifies female) * P(Witness incorrectly identifies female)

P(Attacker is male) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0) * (0.2) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
