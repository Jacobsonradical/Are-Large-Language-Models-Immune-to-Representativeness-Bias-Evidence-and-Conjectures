To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's define the following variables:

- A: The event that the attacker is male
- Β: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being male in the population
P(Β|A) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker
P(Β| not A) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male
P(not A) = Probability of the attacker being female

The witness's ability to judge gender is given as follows:

P(Β|A) = 0.8
P(Β|not A) = 0.2

The gender distribution in the city is given as follows:

P(A) = P(not A) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female)

We want to find P(A|Β), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|Β) = P(Β|A) * P(A) / [P(Β|A) * P(A) + P(Β|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values we have, we get:

P(A|Β) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating this gives:

P(A|Β) ≈ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41, or 41%.
