Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. Since we don't have specific information about the gender of the attacker, let's assume that the probability of the attacker being male is p. Then, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is 0.8p.

On the other hand, the witness errs 20% of the time, which means that when the actual gender is male, the witness misidentifies it as female 0.2p times.

Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of randomly picking a female is 0.85 and the probability of picking a male is 0.15.

If the witness is identifying a female, the probability of being correct is 0.85 and the probability of being wrong is 0.15. So, the total probability of the witness identifying a female as male is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Since the population is 85% female, the probability of the witness seeing a female is 0.85. Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying a female as male is 0.85 * 0.03 = 0.026.

So, the probability of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8p, and the probability of the witness identifying a female as male is 0.026. Since the witness saw the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is the probability of the witness being correct divided by the sum of the probabilities of being correct and being wrong.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is (0.8p) / ((0.8p) + 0.026).

Since we don't have a specific value for p, we cannot provide a numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is male. However, we can say that the probability is greater than 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 and less than 1, since the probability of being correct is always greater than or equal to the true probability.
