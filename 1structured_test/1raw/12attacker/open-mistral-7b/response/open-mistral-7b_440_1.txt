To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's gender identification.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(W|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(W|F) as the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female attacker as male

Given the information we have, we can make some assumptions:
1. P(M) + P(F) = 1 (the total probability of the attacker being either male or female)
2. P(W|M) = 0.8 (from the question)
3. P(W|F) = 0.2 (given that the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the probability, we find:
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.112

So, based on the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 11.2%.
