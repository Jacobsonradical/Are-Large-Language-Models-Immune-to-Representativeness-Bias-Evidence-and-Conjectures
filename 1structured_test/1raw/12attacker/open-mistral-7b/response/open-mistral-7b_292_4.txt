To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The gender distribution in the city: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Given that the witness's error rate is 20%, we can assume that 20% of their identified genders are incorrect. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there is a 20% chance that the attacker is actually female.

The probability that the attacker is male is then:

{probability: 0.8, explanation: The witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time in similar situations. Given that the witness's error rate is 20%, we can assume that 20% of their identified genders are incorrect. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this means that the attacker is actually male 80% of the time when the witness's identification is correct.}
