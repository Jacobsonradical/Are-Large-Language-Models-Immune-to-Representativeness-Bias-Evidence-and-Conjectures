To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. From the information provided, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80%, while they err 20% of the time.
3. However, we do not have enough information to determine if the witness's error rate is biased towards one gender or not. If it is, this could affect our estimate.
4. Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, and assuming the error rate is not biased, we can calculate the probability of this event happening by chance.
5. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability of incorrectly identifying a female as male is 20%.
6. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of the witness encountering a female in this scenario is 0.85.
7. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male in this scenario is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.
8. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.
9. Since there are 15% males in the city, the probability of the witness encountering a male in this scenario is 0.15.
10. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male in this scenario is 0.83 * 0.15 = 0.1245.
11. Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male in this scenario, which is 0.1245.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.1245 or 12.45%.
