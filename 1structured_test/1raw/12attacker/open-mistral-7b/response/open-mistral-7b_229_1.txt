To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male (from information "a").
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time (from information "b").

When the witness sees a person and identifies them as male, there are two possibilities:

a) The witness correctly identified a male person.
b) The witness incorrectly identified a female person as male.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male person is 0.15 (the proportion of males in the city).

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female person as male is 0.85 (the proportion of females in the city) times 0.2 (the probability of the witness erring).

So, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female person as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since there are two possibilities for the witness's identification, the probability that the attacker is actually male, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probabilities of both possibilities:

0.15 (correct identification) + 0.17 (incorrect identification) = 0.32

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.32.
