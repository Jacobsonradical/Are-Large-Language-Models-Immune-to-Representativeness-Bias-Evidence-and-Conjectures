To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and there is an equal distribution of males and females in the sample, we can assume that the witness's error rate (20%) is also due to an equal number of false positives (mistaking a female as male) and false negatives (mistaking a male as female).

The witness identified the attacker as male, which means there was either a correct identification or a false positive. We don't have information about the specific case, so we cannot know for sure. However, we can calculate the probability of each event based on the given information:

1. Probability of a correct identification: 80% (since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
2. Probability of a false positive: 20% (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

Given that the city has an 85% female population, we can infer that the attacker is more likely to be female. However, since the witness identified the attacker as male, and we don't know if this was a correct identification or a false positive, we shouldn't simply assume that the attacker is female. Instead, we should take into account the probabilities of both events:

1. If the identification was a correct identification, the attacker is male. The probability of this event is 80%.
2. If the identification was a false positive, the attacker is actually female, but the witness mistakenly identified them as male. The probability of this event is 20%.

Since we don't know which event occurred, we cannot definitively say that the attacker is male or female. However, we can calculate the combined probability of both events to get an estimate of the overall probability that the attacker is male:
