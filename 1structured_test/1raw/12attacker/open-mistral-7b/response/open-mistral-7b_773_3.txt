To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given and make an assumption about the attacker's gender being independent of the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

1. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Assuming independence between the witness's ability and the actual gender of the attacker, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is, in fact, male. This probability is the witness's success rate, which is 0.8 or 80%.

However, we don't know the actual gender of the attacker, so we need to consider both possibilities - the attacker being male and the attacker being female.

The probability of the attacker being male is P(male), and the probability of the attacker being female is P(female). Given that the attacker is male, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is 0.8. Given that the attacker is female, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is 0, as she would always incorrectly identify a female as male (since she errs 20% of the time, but in this case, she would always be wrong).

The overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is the weighted sum of these two probabilities, which is the probability of the attacker being male times the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, plus the probability of the attacker being female times the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female.

This can be written as: P(witness identifies as male) = P(male) * 0.8 + P(female) * 0

Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15, and the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(witness identifies as male) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0
P(witness identifies as male) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%. This is a significantly lower probability than the witness's report, suggesting that the witness might have erroneously identified the attacker as male. This underscores the importance of eyewitness testimony being corroborated with other evidence.
