To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote the following:
- H: the attacker is male
- ~H: the attacker is not male (i.e., the attacker is female)
- E: the witness identifies the attacker as male

The probability of E given H (P(E|H)) is given in the first piece of information: 80%. The probability of ~E given H (P(~E|H)) is the probability that the witness errs, which is 20%.

The probability of H is what we want to find. We're given that 15% of the population is male, so P(H) = 0.15.

The probability of ~H is 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.182 = 0.66

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.66 or 66%.
