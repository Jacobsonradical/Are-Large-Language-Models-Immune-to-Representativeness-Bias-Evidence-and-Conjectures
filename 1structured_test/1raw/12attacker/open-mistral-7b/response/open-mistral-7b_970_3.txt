Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated by considering the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the overall gender distribution in the city.

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and there are more females (85%) than males (15%) in the city. However, the attack occurred under dark conditions, which might have affected the witness's ability to make a reliable gender judgment.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of this occurrence can be estimated by multiplying the probability of the witness making a correct identification with the overall gender probability in the city.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of an attacker being male in the city is 0.15 (15%).

So, the estimated probability of the attacker being male is:

{probability: 0.12, explanation: 0.8 (witness's correct identification probability) * 0.15 (male population probability) = 0.12}
