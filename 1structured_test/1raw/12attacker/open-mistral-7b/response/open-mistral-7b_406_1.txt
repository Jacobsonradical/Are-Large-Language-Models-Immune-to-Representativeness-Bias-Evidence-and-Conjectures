To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that provides a way to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification. The prior probability of the hypothesis (P(h)) is the probability of the attacker being male before considering the evidence. The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(e|h)) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male. The likelihood of the evidence given the alternative hypothesis (P(e|~h)) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male.

From the information given, we have:

1. P(h) = probability that the attacker is male = 15% (as per information b)
2. P(e|h) = probability of the witness correctly identifying a male = 0.8 (from information a)
3. P(e|~h) = probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male = 0.2 (from information a)

Since the population is half male and half female, the probability of the witness identifying a female as female is also 0.8. So, P(~e|h) = P(~e|~h) = 0.8.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(h|e) = P(h) * P(e|h) / [P(h) * P(e|h) + P(~h) * P(e|~h)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(h|e) = 0.15 * 0.8 / [0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the evidence, is 0.12 or 12%. This is significantly lower than the witness's estimate, suggesting that the witness may have made an error in their identification. However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic estimate and there's always some degree of uncertainty.
