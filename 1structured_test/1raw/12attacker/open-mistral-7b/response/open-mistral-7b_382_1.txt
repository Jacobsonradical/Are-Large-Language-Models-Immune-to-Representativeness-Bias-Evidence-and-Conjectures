To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses given evidence. In this case, the hypotheses are "attacker is male" and "attacker is female," and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(Hypothesis | Evidence) = (P(Evidence | Hypothesis) * P(Hypothesis)) / P(Evidence)

Let's break down the terms:

1. P(attacker is male) is the prior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being male before considering the witness's evidence.
2. P(witness identifies attacker as male | attacker is male) is the likelihood, which is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
3. P(witness identifies attacker as male | attacker is female) is the likelihood, which is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male given that the attacker is female.
4. P(witness identifies attacker as male) is the marginal likelihood, which is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender.

From the information given, we know that:

1. P(attacker is male) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female)
2. P(witness identifies attacker as male | attacker is male) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge gender)
3. P(witness identifies attacker as male | attacker is female) = 0.2 (from the witness's ability to judge gender)

To find P(witness identifies attacker as male), we can use the law of total probability:

P(witness identifies attacker as male) = P(witness identifies attacker as male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness identifies attacker as male | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female)

So P(witness identifies attacker as male) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is male | witness identifies attacker as male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.306

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.306 or 30.6%.
