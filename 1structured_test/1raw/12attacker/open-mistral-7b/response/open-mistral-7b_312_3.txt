To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. The general population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we know that they made a correct identification or an error. Let's assign variables to these two possibilities:

- Event A: The attacker is male (true probability 15%)
- Event B: The attacker is female, but the witness erroneously identifies the attacker as male (false probability 85 * 0.20 = 17%)

We know that the witness identified the attacker as male, so we can write an equation:

P(A) + P(B) = 1

Now, we also know that the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time. So, we can write another equation:

0.80 * P(A) + 0.20 * P(B) = 1

We have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve them. Let's isolate P(A) in the first equation:

P(A) = 1 - P(B)

Now, substitute this expression into the second equation:

0.80 * (1 - P(B)) + 0.20 * P(B) = 1

Simplify and solve for P(B):

0.80 - 0.80 * P(B) + 0.20 * P(B) = 1
0.20 * P(B) = 0.20
P(B) = 0.10

Now, we can find P(A):

P(A) = 1 - P(B)
P(A) = 1 - 0.10
P(A) = 0.90

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.90 or 90%.
