Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and the error rate is 20%.
2. The population composition is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when identifying gender.
2. In this case, the witness identified the attacker as male.
3. If the population composition is 85% female and 15% male, and the witness's error rate is 20%, it means that when the attacker is actually female, the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male 20% of the time.
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is female, given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, is the error rate of 20%.
5. Since the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender as male is 80%.
6. However, we need to consider the actual population composition to calculate the probability that the attacker is male.
7. The witness's error rate of 20% suggests that in 20% of the cases when the attacker is female, the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male.
8. This means that in 80% of the cases when the attacker is female, the witness correctly identifies the attacker as female.
9. So, in the 15% of the population that is male, the witness correctly identifies the gender 100% of the time.
10. In the 85% of the population that is female, the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time.
11. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is the sum of the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies the gender, plus the probability that the attacker is female and the witness incorrectly identifies the gender, divided by 100%.

The calculation would look like this:

(15% * 100%) / (15% * 100% + 85% * 80% + 85% * 20%) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.68 + 0.17) = 0.15 / 0.90 = 0.167 or 16.7%

However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is independent of the actual population composition. In reality, this might not be the case, as people may be more likely to misidentify the gender of individuals who are less typical of their own gender. Therefore, this estimate should be considered a rough approximation and not a definitive answer.
