Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have enough information to adjust for the bias in favor of identifying females (given that 85% of the population is female), we'll assume that the error rate is evenly distributed between misidentifying males as females and vice versa.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as 'p'. Then the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male is 'p'. The probability of the witness erring and misidentifying the attacker as male is (1-p).

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we can write the equation: 0.8 = p + (1-p)*err_rate

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, err_rate = 0.2. Solving the equation, we get: 0.8 = p + 0.2 * (1-p)
0.8 = p + 0.2 - 0.2p
0.6p = 0.8
p = 0.6 / 0.2 = 3

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, it's clear that the witness's accuracy in this specific case cannot be relied upon to estimate the attacker's gender. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive probability estimate.

{probability: Unable to provide a number between 0 and 1 due to the inherent bias in the witness's observations and the limited information provided.}
