Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male.
2. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is only 80%, and they err 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male. But since the witness's accuracy is less than perfect, it's possible that they made an error and the attacker is actually female.
4. To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the city's population distribution and the witness's error rate.
5. If we assume that the witness's error rate is random and independent of the true gender of the attacker, then the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker is the proportion of male individuals in the city multiplied by the witness's accuracy in identifying males: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).
6. On the other hand, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male is the proportion of female individuals in the city multiplied by the witness's error rate in identifying females: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).
7. Since the witness's errors are independent events, we can add these two probabilities to get the overall probability that the witness made an error: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%).
8. Therefore, the probability that the witness accurately identified a male attacker (and the attacker is indeed male) is the complement of the probability that the witness made an error: 1 - 0.29 = 0.71 (71%).

So, based on the given information and assuming the witness's error rate is random and independent of the true gender of the attacker, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.71, or 71%.
