Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population demographics and the witness's testimony.

1. From the population demographics, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. However, since the victim could not see the attacker's gender, this information is not directly applicable to our estimation.

2. The witness, who has an 80% success rate in identifying gender and a 20% error rate, identified the attacker as male. This information is more relevant to our estimation, but we need to account for the possibility of the witness making an error.

Since we don't know whether the witness made an error or not, we can't make a definitive estimate based on the witness's testimony alone. However, we can use the Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability, which takes into account both the prior probability (from the population demographics) and the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is male or female.

Unfortunately, to do this, we would need to know the prior probability of the witness making an error, which is not provided in the information. Therefore, I'm unable to provide a strict probability estimate in the format you requested.

To proceed further, we would need more information, such as the prior probability of the witness making an error, or additional evidence that could help clarify the attacker's gender.
