To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume that the attacker is male. In this case, the witness would correctly identify the attacker as male 80% of the time. However, there is also a chance that the witness mistakes a female attacker for a male, which happens 20% of the time.

Since the city is 85% female, there are more females than males. The probability of picking a female at random is 0.85, and the probability of picking a male is 0.15.

If the witness mistakes a female for a male, the probability of this happening is 0.20 (the error rate). Since there are more females, the probability of mistaking a female for a male is higher than mistaking a male for a female.

Let F be the probability of picking a female at random, and M be the probability of picking a male at random. We know that F = 0.85 and M = 0.15.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is M = 0.15, and the probability of the witness mistaking a female for a male is F * 0.20 = 0.17 (0.85 * 0.20).

The total probability of the witness identifying a person as male is the sum of these two probabilities:

0.15 (correctly identifying a male) + 0.17 (mistaking a female for a male) = 0.32

However, the witness reported that they identified the attacker as male. This means that the attacker was either correctly identified as male (0.15) or mistakenly identified as male (0.17). The total probability of the witness reporting a male attacker is:

0.15 (correctly identifying a male) + 0.17 (mistakenly identifying a female as male) = 0.32

Since the attacker was actually male, we are interested in the probability of the witness reporting a male attacker given that the attacker is male. This probability is the same as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male or mistakenly identifying a female as male: 0.32

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.32 (or 32%). This estimate takes into account the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city.
