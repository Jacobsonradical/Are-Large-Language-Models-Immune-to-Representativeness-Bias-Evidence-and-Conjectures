To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability.

The population statistics indicate that 15% of the city's population is male. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is only 80% for a 50-50 gender split. This means that even if the attacker is actually male (as per population statistics), there's a 20% chance that the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as female.

On the other hand, if the attacker is female (which is more likely given the population statistics), there's a 20% chance that the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as male.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can consider two scenarios:

1) The attacker is actually male, and the witness correctly identified the gender. In this case, the attacker is definitely male.
2) The attacker is actually female, and the witness made an error. In this case, the attacker is still potentially male (since the error rate is 20%).

Since we're interested in the probability that the attacker is male, we can calculate this probability by adding the probability of both scenarios where the attacker is actually male:

1) Probability of attacker being male and witness being correct: 15% (population statistics) * 0.8 (witness reliability) = 12%
2) Probability of attacker being female and witness making an error: 85% (population statistics) * 0.2 (witness reliability) = 17%

Total probability of attacker being male: 12% + 17% = 29%

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 29%. This means that there is a 29% chance that the witness's identification of the attacker as male is correct, and a 71% chance that it is incorrect.
