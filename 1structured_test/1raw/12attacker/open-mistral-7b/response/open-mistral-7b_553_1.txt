To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability of the attacker being male
- P(F) as the probability of the attacker being female
- P(w|M) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker
- P(w|F) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male

From the information given, we know that P(w|M) = 0.8, P(w|F) = 0.2, P(M) + P(F) = 1, and P(F) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female).

To find P(M), we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(M | w) = [P(w | M) * P(M)] / [P(w | M) * P(M) + P(w | F) * P(F)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(M | w) = [0.8 * P(M)] / [0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * 0.15]

Now, we need to solve for P(M). Since P(M) + P(F) = 1, we can write:

P(M) = 1 - P(F) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Substituting this value into the previous equation, we get:

P(M | w) = [0.8 * 0.85] / [0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

P(M | w) = 0.68

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.68 or 68%.
