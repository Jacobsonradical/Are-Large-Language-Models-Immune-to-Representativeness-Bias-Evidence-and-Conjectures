To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes how to update the probability for a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

From the information provided, we can calculate the following probabilities:

1. P(E | H): This is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, we can calculate this probability as 0.8.

2. P(H): This is the prior probability of the hypothesis. Since we don't have any information about the gender distribution of attackers in this specific situation, we can assume that the prior probability is equal to the gender distribution in the population, which is given as 15% male and 85% female. So, P(H) = 0.15.

3. P(E): This is the probability of the evidence, which is the witness identifying someone as male, regardless of whether the person is male or female. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the probability of the evidence is the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct and the witness being wrong, given that they identified someone as male. So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 (probability of being correct) + 0.2 * 0.85 (probability of being wrong) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.241

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.241 or 24.1%.
