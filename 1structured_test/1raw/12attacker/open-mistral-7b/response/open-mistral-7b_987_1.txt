Given the two pieces of information, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The gender distribution in the city (85% female, 15% male).
2. The witness's accuracy in gender identification (80% correct, 20% incorrect).

However, the witness's statement contradicts the city's gender distribution. If we assume that the witness's statement is true, we would be overestimating the proportion of male attackers based on the city's gender distribution alone.

To account for this discrepancy, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability (the city's gender distribution) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

First, let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male
- P(w) as the probability that the witness makes the identified gender

We are given P(M) = 0.15, P(F) = 0.85, P(w|M) = 0.8, and P(w|F) = 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states that P(M|w) = P(w|M) * P(M) / P(w), where P(w) = P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F).

After calculating P(w), we can find P(M|w).

However, it is important to note that the witness's statement contradicts the city's gender distribution, which makes it difficult to provide a reliable estimate based solely on these two pieces of information. It would be advisable to gather additional evidence or information to improve the accuracy of the estimate.

{probability: 0.32, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This is the estimated probability that the attacker is male based on the given information, but as stated, it's important to consider the contradiction between the witness's statement and the city's gender distribution.
