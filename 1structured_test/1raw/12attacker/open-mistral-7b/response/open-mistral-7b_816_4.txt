The probability estimate can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (the attacker is male) given the evidence (the witness's identification). This is what we are trying to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. This is the probability of the attacker being male before considering any evidence.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence. This is the probability of the witness making the identification, regardless of the gender of the attacker.

First, let's calculate P(E|H). Since the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(H). According to the second piece of information, 15% of the population is male. So P(H) = 0.15.

Now, let's calculate P(E). Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.6.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
        = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.6
        = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12 or 12%. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on the given information and may not accurately reflect the true probability in the actual situation.
