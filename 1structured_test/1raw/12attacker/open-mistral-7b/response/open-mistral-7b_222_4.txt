To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(Male), and the probability that the attacker is female as P(Female).

From the given information, we know that P(Male) + P(Female) = 1 and that the overall population is 85% female and 15% male. So, P(Male) = 0.15 and P(Female) = 0.85.

The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. When the witness sees a male, they correctly identify him as male 80% of the time, and when they see a female, they incorrectly identify her as male 20% of the time.

Let's denote the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as M and the probability that they incorrectly identify a female as F.

We know that M + F = 1, since the witness will always identify someone as either male or female. We also know that M = 0.8 and F = 0.2 based on the witness's performance.

Now, let's consider the evidence of the witness. The witness identified the attacker as male. Given that the attacker is actually male with probability P(Male), the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male is M * P(Male) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Given that the attacker is actually female with probability P(Female), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies her as male is F * P(Female) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the total probability that this event happens is the sum of the two probabilities above: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

However, the total probability of the event should be equal to the probability that the attacker is male, which we know is 0.15. Therefore, we need to adjust the witness's identification to match the true probability.

We can do this by multiplying the observed probability (0.29) by the ratio of the true probability (0.15) to the expected probability based on the witness's performance (0.12 + 0.17): 0.29 * (0.15 / (0.12 + 0.17)) = 0.15.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15, or 15%.
