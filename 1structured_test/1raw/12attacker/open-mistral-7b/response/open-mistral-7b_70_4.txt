To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are given the prior probability of H (P(H)), which is not provided in the information. However, we can use the ratio of males to females in the population (P(Male/Total)) as an approximation for P(H), given that the attacker's gender was not seen.

P(Male/Total) = 0.15 (from information b)

We are also given the likelihood of E given H (P(E|H)), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male. This is given as 0.8 in the information a.

P(E|H) = 0.8

We are also given the likelihood of E given not-H (P(E|not-H)), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male. This can be calculated as 1 - P(E|not-H) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, since the witness incorrectly identifies a gender 20% of the time.

P(E|not-H) = 0.8

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not-H) * P(not-H)]

Since we don't have the prior probability of H (P(H)), we can use the ratio of males to females in the population (0.15) as an approximation:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * (1 - 0.15)]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, given the witness's statement and the gender distribution in the population, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
