Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

The formula is as follows:

P(Hypothesis | Evidence) = [P(Evidence | Hypothesis) * P(Hypothesis)] / [P(Evidence)]

Here,
- Hypothesis is the event that the attacker is male.
- Evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.
- P(Hypothesis) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which can be estimated from the city's population statistics.
- P(Evidence | Hypothesis) is the likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male, which is given as 0.8 in the problem.
- P(Evidence) is the probability of the witness making the observation (identifying the attacker as male), which is the sum of the probabilities of this event happening under both hypotheses (attacker is male or attacker is female).

First, let's calculate P(Evidence):

P(Evidence) = P(Evidence | Hypothesis) * P(Hypothesis) + P(Evidence | Not Hypothesis) * P(Not Hypothesis)

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, P(Hypothesis) = 0.15 and P(Not Hypothesis) = 0.85.

P(Evidence | Not Hypothesis) is the probability of the witness identifying a female as male, which is given as 0.2 in the problem.

So, P(Evidence) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(Hypothesis | Evidence):

P(Hypothesis | Evidence) = [P(Evidence | Hypothesis) * P(Hypothesis)] / P(Evidence)

P(Hypothesis | Evidence) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
