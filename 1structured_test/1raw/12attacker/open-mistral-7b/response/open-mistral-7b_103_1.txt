Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a principle of conditional probability used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B), where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B,
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A,
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A,
- P(B) is the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being male, and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

The prior probability of the attacker being male (P(A)) is given as 15% (or 0.15) based on the city's population distribution. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male (P(B|A)) is given as 80% (or 0.8), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female (P(not B|A)) is given as 20% (or 0.2).

Since the witness's ability to judge gender is symmetric (i.e., the probability of incorrectly identifying a female as male is equal to the probability of incorrectly identifying a male as female), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male (P(not B|not A)) is also 20% (or 0.2).

Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a female as female (P(B|not A)) is 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male (B), the probability of the attacker being male (P(A|B)) can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
             = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
             = 0.12 / 0.242
             â‰ˆ 0.5

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.5 or 50%. This estimate takes into account the city's population distribution and the witness's ability to judge gender under the given conditions.
