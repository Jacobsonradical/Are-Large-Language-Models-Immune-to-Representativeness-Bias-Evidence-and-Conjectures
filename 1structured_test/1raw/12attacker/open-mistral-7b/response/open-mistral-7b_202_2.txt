To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's error rate.

1. From the population distribution (information "a"), we know that 15% of the city's population is male.
2. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as male (information "b") might not necessarily reflect the true gender distribution in the city due to the witness's error rate.
3. The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. This means that when they say they saw a male, they might be mistaken 20% of the time and actually saw a female.

To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification as follows:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 1 - the probability of the witness making an error when they see a male. Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time, their correct identification rate for males is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
2. This means that out of 100 times the witness sees a male, they will correctly identify him as male 80 times.
3. Now, we need to consider the fact that the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male. If the witness identifies a person as male, there's a good chance they are actually looking at a female that the witness mistakenly identified as male.
4. To account for this, we can calculate the actual proportion of males in the city that the witness correctly identifies as male by multiplying the actual male population proportion (0.15) by the witness's correct identification rate for males (0.8): 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12, or 12%. This means that, given the information at hand, there's a 12% chance that the attacker is male, and an 88% chance that the attacker is female.
