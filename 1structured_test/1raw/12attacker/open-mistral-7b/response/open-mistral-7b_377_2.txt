The given information can be broken down as follows:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who has an accuracy of 80% in identifying genders and an error rate of 20%, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

We know that the attacker could be either male or female, and the initial population distribution gives us a prior probability of the attacker being male (P(M)).

However, we also have information from the witness, who has a certain level of accuracy in identifying genders. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this event can be described as W(M) (witnessing a male).

The probability of W(M) given that the attacker is actually male (P(W(M)|M)) is equal to the witness's accuracy, which is 80%. Similarly, the probability of W(M) given that the attacker is female (P(W(M)|F)) is equal to the witness's error rate, which is 20%.

To estimate the probability of the attacker being male (P(M)), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(M) = P(W(M)|M) * P(M) / [P(W(M)|M) * P(M) + P(W(M)|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Solving this equation gives us:

P(M) = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
