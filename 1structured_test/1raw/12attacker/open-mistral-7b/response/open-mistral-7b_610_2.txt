Given the information provided, the attacker's gender is initially unknown to us. However, we do have two pieces of information that can help us make an estimate:

1. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male (from information "a").
2. A witness, who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male (from information "b").

Let's assume that the witness's gender identification accuracy is not biased towards one gender. In this case, if the witness identifies a person as male, there are two possibilities:

- The witness correctly identified a male attacker (probability 0.80).
- The witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male (probability 0.20).

Since we don't know the attacker's gender yet, we can treat these two possibilities as equally likely. If the witness's identification is a true positive (correct identification of a male attacker), then the attacker is indeed male. If the witness's identification is a false positive (incorrect identification of a female attacker as male), then the attacker is actually female, but we mistakenly believe she is male based on the witness's statement.

Given the city's gender distribution, the probability of a female attacker is 0.85, and the probability of a male attacker is 0.15. However, since we mistakenly believe the attacker is male based on the witness's statement, we should adjust these probabilities to account for this error.

Let's call P(M) the probability that the attacker is male and P(F|M) the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female attacker as male. We know that P(F|M) = 0.20. We can calculate P(M) as follows:

P(M) = P(witness identifies attacker as male and attacker is male) / P(witness identifies attacker as male)

P(witness identifies attacker as male and attacker is male) = P(M) * P(witness identifies male as male) = P(M) * 0.80

P(witness identifies attacker as male) = P(M) * P(witness identifies male as male) + P(F|M) * P(witness identifies female as male)

P(witness identifies female as male) = P(F) * P(witness identifies female as male)

As we don't have enough information about the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male when the actual attacker is female (P(witness identifies female as male)), we can't solve this equation directly. However, we can make an educated guess based on the witness's overall accuracy and the city's gender distribution. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we can assume that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male when the actual attacker is female (P(witness identifies female as male)) is lower than 0.20.

Taking into account this assumption, we can estimate P(M) to be higher than 0.15 (the city's gender distribution) but lower than 0.80 (the witness's overall accuracy for male identification). To make a more precise estimate, we would need more information about the witness's accuracy for female identification when the actual attacker is female.

Based on the available information, we can only provide a rough estimate for P(M). A possible estimate for P(M) could be around 0.35 to 0.40, which is higher than the city's gender distribution (0.15) but lower than the witness's overall accuracy for male identification (0.80).
