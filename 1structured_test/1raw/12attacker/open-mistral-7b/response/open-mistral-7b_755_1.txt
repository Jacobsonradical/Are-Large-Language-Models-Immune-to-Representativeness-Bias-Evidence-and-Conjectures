Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This is our prior probability based on city demographics.

2. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as male is not necessarily an accurate reflection of the city's demographics, given the witness's error rate of 20% in gender identification.

3. To account for the witness's error, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability in light of the new evidence (the witness's identification). Bayes' theorem is expressed as: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

4. We are given that P(B|A) is 1 (the witness always correctly identifies a male as male), and P(A) is 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male). We are also given that P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, which is 0.8 (given that half the time the witness sees a female, they incorrectly identify her as male).

5. So, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.1875, or approximately 18.75%.

Therefore, based on the witness's identification and the witness's error rate, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 18.75%.
