Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have direct information about how this witness's accuracy translates to the specific attacker. We do know that the attacker's gender is not the majority in the city, as 85% of the population is female.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula is as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E), P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, and P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

Given the information provided, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

1. P(E|H) = 0.2 (The witness errs 20% of the time, so the probability that they are wrong when they identify a male is 0.2)
2. P(E|~H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so the probability that they are right when they identify a female is 0.8)
3. P(H) = 0.15 (The attacker's gender is male, and 85% of the population is female, so the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15)
4. P(~H) = 0.85 (The attacker's gender is female, and 85% of the population is female, so the prior probability of the attacker being female is 0.85)
5. P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.42

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)] = (0.2 * 0.15) / 0.42 â‰ˆ 0.157

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 15.7%.
