To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an appropriate adjustment for the witness's error rate.

First, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. However, the witness's gender identification accuracy is 80% for males and 80% for females, but with a total error rate of 20%. Since the error rate is the same for both genders, the witness is more likely to identify a female as a male than a male as a female, given the city's demographics.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female

We know that P(M) + P(F) = 1, and we have two pieces of information:

1) The population distribution: P(M) = 0.15 and P(F) = 0.85

2) The witness's gender identification accuracy: If the attacker is male, the probability that the witness misidentifies him as female is 0.20. If the attacker is female, the probability that the witness misidentifies her as male is also 0.20.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can rewrite the second piece of information as:

P(M) * (1 - 0.20) >= 0.80 (witness correctly identifies a male as male)
P(F) * 0.20 <= 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find an estimate for P(M):

P(M | witness_says_male) = [P(witness_says_male | M) * P(M)] / [P(witness_says_male | M) * P(M) + P(witness_says_male | F) * P(F)]

Given the witness's gender identification accuracy, P(witness_says_male | M) = 0.8 and P(witness_says_male | F) = 0.2.

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M | witness_says_male) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 12%. However, this estimate is likely biased by the witness's gender identification error rate, which may not reflect the true gender distribution of the attacker population. In practice, it's essential to gather additional evidence and consider other factors to accurately determine the attacker's gender.
