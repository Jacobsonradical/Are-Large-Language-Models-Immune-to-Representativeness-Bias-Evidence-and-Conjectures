To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the witness's reliability.

1. From the given information, we know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.
2. However, the witness's ability to identify gender is not 100% accurate. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:
   a) The attacker is indeed male, and the witness correctly identified the gender.
   b) The attacker is female, and the witness erroneously identified the gender.
4. Given the witness's reliability, the probability of scenario (a) is the probability that the attacker is male in the general population multiplied by the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male:
   Probability of scenario (a) = Probability of male in population * Probability of correct identification
   = 0.15 * 0.8
   = 0.12
5. The probability of scenario (b) is the probability that the attacker is female in the general population multiplied by the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a female:
   Probability of scenario (b) = Probability of female in population * Probability of incorrect identification
   = 0.85 * 0.2
   = 0.17
6. Since both scenarios are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, their probabilities add up to 1:
   Probability of scenario (a) + Probability of scenario (b) = 1
   = 0.12 + 0.17
   = 0.29
7. However, this does not give us the probability that the attacker is male, but rather the probability that the witness's identification matches the true gender. To get the probability that the attacker is male, we need to divide the probability of scenario (a) by the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios:
   Probability of attacker being male = Probability of scenario (a) / (Probability of scenario (a) + Probability of scenario (b))
   = 0.12 / 0.29
   = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41 or 41.38%.
