To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness's error rate is not biased towards either gender. This means that if the actual gender distribution is 50-50, the witness will still err 20% of the time, even though the errors may be distributed unevenly between male and female.

The city has an 85% female population and a 15% male population. If we assume that the witness's gender identification is independent of the actual gender distribution in the city, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male:

P(Male | Attack) = P(Attack | Male) * P(Male) / P(Attack)

We don't have enough information to calculate P(Attack | Male), but we can assume that it's the same as P(Attack | Female), as the witness's gender identification is not biased. Therefore, we can simplify the equation to:

P(Male | Attack) = P(Male) * P(Attack | Male) / [P(Male) * P(Attack | Male) + P(Female) * P(Attack | Female)]

We know P(Male) = 0.15, P(Female) = 0.85, and P(Attack | Male) = P(Attack | Female), but we don't know their values. However, given the witness's gender identification accuracy, it's reasonable to assume that P(Attack | Male) ≈ P(Attack | Female) ≈ 0.8, as the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(Male | Attack) ≈ 0.15 * 0.8 / [0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.8]

Calculating this value, we get:

P(Male | Attack) ≈ 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.8) ≈ 0.15 * 0.8 / 0.8 = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12, or 12%.
