To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness errs in 20% of the cases.
2. 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as p and the probability that the witness errs in identifying a male as m. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, m = 0.2.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male is 1 - m = 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability that the witness correctly identified a male multiplied by the probability that the attacker is male, and the probability that the witness erred in identifying a female multiplied by the probability that the attacker is female.

The probability that the witness correctly identified a male is 0.8, and the probability that the attacker is male is p. The probability that the witness erred in identifying a female is 0.2, and the probability that the attacker is female is 1 - p.

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is:

0.8 * p + 0.2 * (1 - p)

We know that the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time, so the above equation should equal 0.8. Solving for p, we get:

0.8p + 0.2 - 0.2p = 0.8
0.6p = 0.6
p = 1

However, since the probability of an event must be between 0 and 1, this result suggests that the witness's ability to judge gender under the given conditions is not consistent with the observed error rate of 20%. It is likely that the witness's ability to judge gender is affected by other factors, such as lighting or distance, which were not considered in this analysis.

Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. It would be necessary to have more information or consider alternative explanations for the witness's identification.
