Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. A witness, who is typically reliable 80% of the time in identifying gender and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's break this down:

The witness's ability to identify gender is independent of the gender distribution in the city. However, we need to account for both the witness's reliability and the actual distribution of genders in the city to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(M).

1. According to the given information, the witness would correctly identify the attacker as male if the attacker is indeed male (P(M)) and would incorrectly identify a female as male with a probability of 0.2 (assuming a 50/50 gender split).

2. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male (P(F)) is given by the gender distribution in the city:
   P(F) = 0.85 (probability of a female) * 0.2 (probability of misidentification) + 0.15 (probability of a male) * 0 = 0.17

3. Since we assume the witness's reliability is the same for both genders, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is:
   P(C|M) = 1 - P(F) = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83

4. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is:
   P(F|M) = 0.2

5. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write a conditional probability equation:
   P(M) = P(M and C) / P(C)

6. The numerator of this equation is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male, which is P(C|M) * P(M). The denominator is the probability of the witness identifying anyone as male, which is P(C|M) * P(M) + P(C|F) * P(F).

7. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male, P(C|F), is the same as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, P(C|M), because the witness's reliability is the same for both genders.

8. Substituting these values into the conditional probability equation, we get:
   P(M) = (P(C|M) * P(M)) / (P(C|M) * P(M) + P(C|F) * P(F))

9. Substituting P(C|M) = 0.83, P(M) = P, P(F) = 0.17, and P(C|F) = P(C|M) = 0.83 into the equation, we get:
   P(M) = (0.83 * P) / (0.83 * P + 0.83 * 0.17)

10. Solving the equation for P, we get:
    P(M) = 0.83P / (0.83P + 0.1481)

Since the probability must be between 0 and 1, this equation does not give us a straightforward numerical answer. However, it does provide a way to estimate the probability given the witness's reliability and the gender distribution in the city. You could use this equation in numerical computations to find a more precise estimate.
