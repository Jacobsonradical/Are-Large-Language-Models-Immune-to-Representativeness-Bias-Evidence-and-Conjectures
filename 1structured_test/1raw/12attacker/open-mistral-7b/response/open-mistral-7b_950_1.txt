Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the witness's reliability and the population ratio.

1. The population ratio of males to females is 15% to 85%.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male.
4. However, we don't know if the witness's error occurred in this specific case (identifying a female as male) or not.

Since we don't have enough information to determine if the witness made an error in this case, the best estimate would be to use the population ratio, which is 15% for males. However, considering the witness's reliability, we can adjust this estimate slightly:

1. If the witness is always correct, the probability would be 100% that the attacker is male.
2. But since the witness errs 20% of the time, there's a chance that the witness could have mistakenly identified a female as male, which would lower the probability.
3. To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is actually male and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of the witness being incorrect.
4. The probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is male is the population ratio of males, which is 0.15.
5. So the probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is male is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.
6. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is actually female is also 0.20.
7. However, since the attacker's gender is unknown, we can't directly use this probability. Instead, we can use it to calculate an expected probability by considering both possibilities.
8. The expected probability of the witness being incorrect is the product of the probability of the attacker being female and the probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is female, plus the product of the probability of the attacker being male and the probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is male: 0.85 * 0.20 + 0.15 * 0.85 = 0.17 + 0.13 = 0.30.
9. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's reliability and the population ratio, is 1 - 0.30 = 0.70.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.70, or 70%.
