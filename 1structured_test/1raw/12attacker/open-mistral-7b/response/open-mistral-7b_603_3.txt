The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male. This means the witness made an error in this case. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's error, is equal to the witness's error rate of 20%.

However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This information suggests that the probability of an attacker being male is lower than 15%.

To reconcile these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness's error).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker being male)
- E is the evidence (the witness's error)
- P(H | E) is the probability of H given E
- P(E | H) is the probability of E given H (the witness's error rate when the attacker is male)
- P(H) is the prior probability of H (the probability of the attacker being male before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of E (the probability of the witness's error, which is the sum of P(E | H) and P(E | ~H), where ~H is the negation of H, i.e., the attacker being female)

Given that the witness's error rate when the attacker is male is 20%, and the prior probability of the attacker being male is 15%, we can calculate P(E | H) and P(H) as follows:

P(E | H) = 0.20
P(H) = 0.15

To calculate P(E), we need to find the probability of the witness's error when the attacker is female. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, and there are twice as many females as males, we can calculate P(E | ~H) as follows:

P(E | ~H) = 0.20 * 2 = 0.40

Therefore, P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ~H) * P(~H) = (0.20 * 0.15) + (0.40 * 0.85) = 0.30 + 0.34 = 0.64

Finally, we can calculate P(H | E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.64 â‰ˆ 0.132

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's error, is approximately 13.2%. This is lower than the prior probability of 15%, suggesting that the witness's error decreases our confidence that the attacker is male. However, it is important to note that this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is constant, which may not be the case in practice.
