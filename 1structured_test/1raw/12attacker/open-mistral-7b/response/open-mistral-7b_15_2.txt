To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's gender 20% of the time. This means they correctly identify gender 80% of the time. Since the attacker's gender is not known, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male is 0.8 (80%).

However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This means that the probability of a randomly selected person being male is 0.15 (15%).

Given that the witness's identification is likely biased towards their personal tendency to identify people as male, we can't simply use their 80% accuracy rate to infer the true probability of the attacker being male. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate an updated probability.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the prior probability of event A divided by the probability of event B. In this case, A is the attacker being male, and B is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

Using the given data, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male. This is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15%).

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying anyone as male, which is 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.16 (16%).

So, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.16 = 0.78125 (78.125%).

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 78.125%.
