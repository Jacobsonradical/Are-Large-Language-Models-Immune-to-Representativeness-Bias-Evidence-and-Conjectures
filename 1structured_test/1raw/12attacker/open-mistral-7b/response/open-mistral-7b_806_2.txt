Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. However, a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender and errs 20% of the time identified the attacker as male.

The witness's 80% accuracy rate means that in 80% of their gender judgments, they correctly identify the gender. Since the attacker's gender is unknown, let's consider the 80% accurate gender judgments made by the witness.

In 80% of their gender judgments, the witness correctly identifies a male 15% of the time (because 15% of the population is male). In the remaining 20% of their gender judgments, the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female.

However, since we don't know if the witness made a correct or incorrect gender judgment in this case, we can't use these numbers directly to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

Instead, let's consider the probability of the witness making a correct gender judgment, given that the attacker is male. This probability is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate) times 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being male in the population).

Similarly, let's consider the probability of the witness making a correct gender judgment, given that the attacker is female. This probability is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate) times 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being female in the population).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the ratio of these two probabilities. This ratio represents the likelihood that the attacker is male, given the witness's gender identification.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is the ratio of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.12, or 12%}

However, this estimate is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to judge gender is independent of the attacker's gender. If there is some bias in the witness's gender judgments, this estimate may not be accurate.

Therefore, while the estimate of 12% suggests that the attacker is more likely to be female, the witness's gender identification is not definitive evidence of the attacker's gender, and further investigation may be necessary to determine the attacker's identity with greater certainty.
