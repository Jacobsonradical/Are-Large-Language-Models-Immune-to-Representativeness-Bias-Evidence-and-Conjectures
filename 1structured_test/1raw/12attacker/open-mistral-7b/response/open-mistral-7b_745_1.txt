To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (witness identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identified male 80% of the time)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being male before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (without considering the hypothesis)

Since we don't have direct information about the prior probability of the attacker being male, we can use the information given in point b) about the gender distribution in the city. We can assume that the prior probability is equal to the proportion of males in the city, which is 15%.

Now let's calculate the other probabilities:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (proportion of males in the city)
- P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)
  P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.164

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.164 â‰ˆ 0.486

So our estimate, based on the given information, is that the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.486 or 48.6%.
