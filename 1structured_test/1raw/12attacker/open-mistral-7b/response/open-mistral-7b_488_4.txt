Based on the provided information, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% (with an error rate of 20%).
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

We cannot directly use the population ratio (85% female and 15% male) as it is not the probability that the witness would assign based on their observations. Instead, we need to adjust the population ratio according to the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

Let's denote the actual probability of the attacker being male as P(male). The probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that the person is male is the accuracy of the witness, which is 0.8 (or 80%). Similarly, the probability that the witness identifies a person as female given that the person is male is the error rate, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(male) as follows:

P(male) = (P(male|witness male) * P(witness male)) / [P(male|witness male) * P(witness male) + P(male|witness female) * P(witness female)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(male) = (0.8 * P(witness male)) / [0.8 * P(witness male) + 0.2 * (1 - P(witness male))]

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as male 20% of the time, P(witness male) is equal to the fraction of the population that is actually male. Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, P(witness male) = 0.15 (or 15%).

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

P(male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating the value, we find:

P(male) = 0.12

So, based on the witness's identification and the population ratio of females and males, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
