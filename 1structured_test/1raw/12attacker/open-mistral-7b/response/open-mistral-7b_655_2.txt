Based on the information provided, the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. However, a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender erred in identifying the attacker as male. This means that the witness incorrectly identified a female as male 20% of the time.

Since the attacker's gender was not seen directly, the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's statement is equal to the probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a female as male.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.2, or 20%.
