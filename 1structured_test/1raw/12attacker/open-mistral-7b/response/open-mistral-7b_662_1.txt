Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence that contradict each other. The first piece of evidence (a) suggests that the attacker is likely female, given the city's population demographics. The second piece of evidence (b) suggests that the witness, who is not infallible and mistakes gender 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both sources of evidence and their relative weights. One way to do this is to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs in light of new evidence.

Bayes' theorem can be written as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability of the attacker being male, before considering the witness's testimony)
- P(B) is the likelihood of B (the probability of the witness's testimony, regardless of the attacker's gender)

From the information provided, we can calculate the following probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the attacker is male, given the city's population demographics)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24 (the probability of the witness's testimony, regardless of the attacker's gender)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.24 = 0.12

So, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 12%. However, it is important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions and simplifications, and the actual probability may be different. The case would benefit from further investigation, such as gathering more evidence or questioning the witness further.
