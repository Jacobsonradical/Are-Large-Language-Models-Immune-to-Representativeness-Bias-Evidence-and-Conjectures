To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is indeed male, and the witness correctly identified the gender.
2. The attacker is female, and the witness errs in identification.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F). We know that P(M) + P(F) = 1 (total probability).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can set up an equation based on the Bayes' theorem:

P(M | Witness's observation) = P(Witness's observation | M) * P(M) / [P(Witness's observation | M) * P(M) + P(Witness's observation | F) * P(F)]

Here, P(Witness's observation | M) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, and P(Witness's observation | F) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.

From the given information, we have:

P(Witness's observation | M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
P(Witness's observation | F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time)
P(M) = Unknown
P(F) = 1 - P(M)

We also know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male:

P(F) = 0.85
P(M) = 0.15

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male:

P(M | Witness's observation) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]
P(M | Witness's observation) â‰ˆ 0.19

So, based on the witness's observation and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.19 or 19%.
