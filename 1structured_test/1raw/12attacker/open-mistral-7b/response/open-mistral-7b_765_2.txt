To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

In this case, the event is the attacker being male, and we have two pieces of prior information:
1. The witness's ability to judge gender (from A).
2. The gender distribution in the city (from B).

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male (we assume this is an error)
- P(M|w) as the probability of the witness seeing a male given that the attacker is male
- P(F|w) as the probability of the witness seeing a male given that the attacker is female (an error)

From the information given, we know that P(w|M) = 0.8, P(w|F) = 0.2, and P(M) + P(F) = 1 (the sum of probabilities is 1). We also know that the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, so P(F) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15.

We want to find P(M|w), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified a male. According to Bayes' theorem, this probability is given by:

P(M|w) = P(w|M) * P(M) / [P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the numbers:

P(M|w) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]
P(M|w) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(M|w) = 0.12 / 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4135 or 41.35%.
