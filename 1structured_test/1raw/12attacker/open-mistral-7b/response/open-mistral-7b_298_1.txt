To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as P_m and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as P_f (since the witness errs 20% of the time, P_f = 0.2).

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of the witness encountering a male is 0.15. The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying this male as female is P_m * 0.15 + P_f * 0.85, since the witness will mistakenly identify a male with probability P_f when the actual gender is female.

However, we are given that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so the actual probability of the witness identifying a male as female must be P_f * 0.85 = 0.2. Solving for P_f, we get P_f = 0.2 / 0.85 ≈ 0.2353.

Now, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is P_m = 1 - P_f = 1 - 0.2353 ≈ 0.7647.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is P_m.

Therefore, {probability: 0.7647} is the estimated probability that the attacker is male.
