Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male by considering two factors: the city's gender distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male. However, we know that the witness's accuracy in gender identification is not perfect, with an error rate of 20%. If the witness said the attacker was male, there could be a chance that the witness was mistaken.

To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness being correct by multiplying the city's male percentage (15%) by the witness's accuracy in gender identification (0.8) for correct identifications, and then subtracting the product of the city's male percentage and the witness's error rate (0.2) for incorrect identifications:

Probability of correct identification = City's male percentage * Witness's accuracy
                                                      = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                      = 0.12

Probability of incorrect identification = City's male percentage * Witness's error rate
                                                         = 0.15 * 0.2
                                                         = 0.03

Now, since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male is the sum of the probability of a correct identification and the probability of an incorrect identification:

Probability of attacker being male = Probability of correct identification + Probability of incorrect identification
                                                      = 0.12 + 0.03
                                                      = 0.15

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 or 15%. This means that there is a 15% chance that the witness was correct in identifying the attacker as male, and a 85% chance that the witness was wrong.
