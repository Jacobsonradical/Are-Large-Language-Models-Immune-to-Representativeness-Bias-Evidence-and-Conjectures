Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness identified the attacker as male, but their ability to correctly identify genders is only 80% accurate. This means they make errors 20% of the time.

However, the witness's error rate doesn't take into account the gender distribution in the city. If the witness is more likely to mistake a female for a male (given the city's gender ratio), then their claim of seeing a male attacker could be more reliable.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we would need to know the witness's error rate when judging gender in a city with the given gender distribution. Unfortunately, this information is not provided.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker is male based on the provided information. It would require more data or making assumptions about the witness's error rate in this specific context.
