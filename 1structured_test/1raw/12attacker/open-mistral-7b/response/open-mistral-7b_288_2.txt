To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given a 85% female and 15% male population, the baseline probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15%).

However, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible explanations:

1. The attacker is indeed male, and the witness correctly identified the gender. The probability of this event is 0.15 (baseline probability of a male attacker) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12 (12%).

2. The attacker is female, and the witness incorrectly identified the gender. The probability of this event is 0.85 (baseline probability of a female attacker) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17 (17%).

The total probability of the witness's observation (either correct or incorrect) is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%).

However, since the witness's observation was that the attacker is male, we should only consider the probability of the first event (the correct identification of a male attacker). So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's observation, is 0.12 (12%).

In summary: {probability: 0.12}
