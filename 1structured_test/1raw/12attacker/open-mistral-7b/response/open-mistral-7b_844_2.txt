To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male), then the probability of the witness misidentifying a male as female is 20%. Conversely, the probability of the witness misidentifying a female as male is also 20%, given the witness's gender identification accuracy.

Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of choosing a random female is 0.85. The probability of choosing a random male is 0.15.

Given that the witness mistakenly identifies a male as female, the probability of this being the actual attacker is 0.20 (the witness's error rate). Therefore, the probability of the attacker being female given this misidentification is P(female|mistaken) = 0.20 / 0.20 * 0.15 / 0.85 = 0.0273.

Similarly, given that the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male, the probability of this being the actual attacker is also 0.20. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male given this misidentification is P(male|mistaken) = 0.20 / 0.20 * 0.85 / 0.15 = 0.9524.

Since we don't know which type of misidentification occurred, we need to find the weighted average of these two probabilities. The probability of the witness making a type I error (mistakenly identifying a male as female) is 0.20, and the probability of a type II error (mistakenly identifying a female as male) is also 0.20.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.20 * 0.0273 + 0.20 * 0.9524 = 0.1852}

The attacker is estimated to be male with a probability of approximately 0.1852 or 18.52%.
