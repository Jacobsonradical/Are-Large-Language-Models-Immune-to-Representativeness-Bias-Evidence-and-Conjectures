Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

Let's define our variables:
- H: The attacker is male
- ~H: The attacker is not male (female in this case)
- E: The witness's identification of the attacker as male

The prior probability of the attacker being male is P(H), which can be estimated from the city's population data. Since 15% of the population is male, we have P(H) = 0.15.

The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male is P(E|H). Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we have P(E|H) = 0.8.

Similarly, the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male is P(E|~H). Given that the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, we have P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Calculating this, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.18 or 18%.
