To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is male
- E: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We are given the prior probability of A, P(A), which is unknown, and the conditional probability of E given A, P(E|A), which is 1 (since the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time, and in this case, the witness was correct).

We are also given the prior probability of not A, P(not A) or P(F), which is the probability that the attacker is female. Since 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, P(F) = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15.

We are given the conditional probability of E given not A, P(E|not A), which is the probability that the witness errs in identifying the gender. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|not A) = 0.2.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)].

Substituting the given values:

P(A|E) = (1 * 0.15) / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|E) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)

P(A|E) = 0.15 / 0.32

P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.46875 or 46.875%.
