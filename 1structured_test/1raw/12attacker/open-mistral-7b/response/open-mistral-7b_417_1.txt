To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. From the given information, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, the witness's reliability in identifying gender is only 80% correct, and they make errors 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male, but since the witness's accuracy is not perfect, there is a chance that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker's gender.
4. To account for this possibility, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification (the attacker is male) and the probability of the witness making a mistake (the attacker is actually female).
5. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of them correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8.
6. Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of a random attacker being female is 0.85.
7. Therefore, the probability of the witness making a mistake and incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.
8. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 - 0.17 = 0.63.

Answer: {probability: 0.63, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
