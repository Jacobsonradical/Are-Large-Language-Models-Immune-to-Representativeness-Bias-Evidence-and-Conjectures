To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an assumption about the reliability of the witness's gender identification in low-light conditions.

Given that 85% of the city's population is female, we might initially think that the attacker is more likely to be female. However, the witness identified the attacker as male with a 80% success rate, and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, this means they are correct 80% of the time. In this case, if the witness identifies someone as male, there is an 80% chance that they are actually male.

However, we cannot ignore the fact that 85% of the city's population is female. So, even if the witness is correct, there's still a chance that they're identifying a woman as a man. To account for this, we can calculate the probability of a false positive (the witness identifying a woman as a man) and subtract it from 1 to get the probability of a true positive (the witness identifying a man as a man).

The probability of a false positive is the probability of drawing a woman from the city's population (0.85) multiplied by the witness's error rate (0.2):

P(False Positive) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate the probability of a true positive:

P(True Positive) = 1 - P(False Positive) = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83

Since the attacker was identified as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability of a true positive:

{probability: 0.83}
