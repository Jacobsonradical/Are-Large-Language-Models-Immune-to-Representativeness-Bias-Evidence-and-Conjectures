To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, let's calculate the values for P(A), P(B|A), and P(B|~A), where ~A denotes not A (i.e., the attacker is female).

P(A) represents the prior probability of the attacker being male, given the population statistics in the city. Since 85% of the population is female, 15% must be male, so P(A) = 0.15.

From the first piece of information, we know that the witness correctly identifies the gender of a person 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can infer that the witness was correct 80% of the time when the attacker was indeed male (P(B|A)) and was incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker was female (P(B|~A)).

Now, we can calculate the probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15))

Calculating the probabilities, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.24

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is approximately 24%.
