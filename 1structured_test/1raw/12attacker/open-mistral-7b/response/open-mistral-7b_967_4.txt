To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an assumption about the attacker's gender being independent of the witness's ability to accurately identify gender.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a male attacker as female and vice versa.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness erring and identifying a male attacker as female is 0.2 (20%).

Since the attacker's gender is unknown, we should consider both the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (0.8) and the probability of the witness erring and identifying a male attacker as female (0.2).

However, we also have information about the gender distribution in the city. Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can use this information to adjust our estimation.

Since the attack occurred at night, the attacker's gender might not be easily distinguishable from just appearance. Therefore, we can assume that the witness's ability to judge gender might be less accurate under these conditions.

Considering this, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being male is lower than the 80% probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker under favorable conditions. But without further information, it is challenging to provide a specific probability.

{probability: less than 0.8, please note that this is an estimate based on the provided information and assumptions}
