To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.

Let's assume that the witness saw the attacker for long enough to make a reliable gender judgment. In this case, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that there's a 80% chance that the attacker is indeed male (correct identification) and a 20% chance that the attacker is female (erroneous identification).

However, since we don't have any information about the actual gender distribution of attackers in the city, we cannot adjust the witness's 80% probability of correct identification to account for the city's gender distribution. Therefore, based on the witness's report, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (80%).

It is worth noting that this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to judge gender is independent of the actual gender distribution in the city. If there are biases or systemic errors in the witness's gender judgments, this estimate may not be accurate.
