Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way of updating the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

The prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)) is given in the first piece of information: 15% of the population is male.

The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)) is given in the second piece of information: the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time.

The likelihood of the evidence given the opposite hypothesis (P(E|~H)) is the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a female as male, which is 1 - the probability of correctly identifying a female as female (1 - 0.8 = 0.2).

Using Bayes' theorem, the updated probability of the hypothesis (P(H|E)) is:

P(H|E) = P(H) * P(E|H) / [P(H) * P(E|H) + P(~H) * P(E|~H)]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.15 * 0.8 / [0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2]

Calculating this gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male of approximately 0.286, or 28.6%.
