To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume that the attacker is female. In this case, the witness would identify the attacker as female 85% of the time (correctly) and as male 15% of the time (incorrectly).

Now, let's assume that the attacker is male. In this case, the witness would identify the attacker as male 80% of the time (correctly) and as female 20% of the time (incorrectly).

Since we don't know the attacker's gender, we can consider the two scenarios as equally likely, and the probability of each scenario is 0.5. We can then calculate the probability of each scenario leading to the witness identifying the attacker as male:

Probability of witness identifying attacker as male given attacker is female = 0.15 (15% chance of witness error)
Probability of witness identifying attacker as male given attacker is male = 0.8 (80% chance of witness correct identification)

The overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male can be calculated by weighting these two probabilities by their respective probabilities:

Overall probability = (Probability of witness identifying attacker as male given attacker is female) * (Probability of attacker being female) + (Probability of witness identifying attacker as male given attacker is male) * (Probability of attacker being male)

Overall probability = (0.15) * (0.5) + (0.8) * (0.5) = 0.425

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.425 (or 42.5%).
