To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. From the population statistics (information "a"), we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. Information "b" tells us that the witness misidentifies gender 20% of the time.

Now, let's analyze the witness's statement that the attacker is male:

1. If the attacker is actually male, the witness correctly identifies the gender (probability of 100%).
2. If the attacker is actually female, the witness incorrectly identifies the gender (probability of 20% from information "b").

Since the witness's statement is male, the probability that the attacker is male is the sum of the probabilities when the witness correctly identifies a male attacker and when the witness mistakenly identifies a female attacker as male:

{probability: (100% * 15%) + (20% * 85%), probability: 0.385}

So, based on the given information, our estimate is that the attacker is male with a probability of 0.385 or 38.5%.
