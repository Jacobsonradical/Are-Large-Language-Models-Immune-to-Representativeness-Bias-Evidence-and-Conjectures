Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% success rate in identifying gender and a 20% error rate. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there's a 0.8 (or 80%) chance that the witness was correct and the attacker is indeed male, and a 0.2 (or 20%) chance that the witness was wrong and the attacker is actually female.

However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is female and 15% is male. This means that even if the witness was wrong about the attacker's gender, it's more likely that the attacker is female due to the gender distribution in the city.

To account for this, we can adjust the initial 80% probability given by the witness's success rate. If we assume that the gender distribution in the city is representative of the attacker's gender, then the probability that the attacker is male should be closer to the city's male population percentage.

So, the final estimate of the probability that the attacker is male would be the product of the witness's success rate and the city's male population percentage:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 12%.
