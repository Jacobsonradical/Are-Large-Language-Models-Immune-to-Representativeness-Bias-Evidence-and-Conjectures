The probability estimate of the attacker being male, given the information provided, can be calculated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male.
2. However, we also have information that a witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.
3. So, even though the overall population is predominantly female, the witness's identification indicates a higher likelihood of the attacker being male.

The probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Witness's Identification) = [P(Witness's Identification | Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Witness's Identification | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness's Identification | Female) * P(Female)]

Given the information, P(Witness's Identification | Male) = 0.8 (the witness is 80% accurate in identifying males)
P(Male) = 0.15 (the proportion of males in the city)
P(Witness's Identification | Female) = 0.2 (the witness is wrong 20% of the time in identifying females)
P(Female) = 0.85 (the proportion of females in the city)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Male | Witness's Identification) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us a probability estimate of approximately 0.22 or 22%. This means that, given the witness's identification and the gender demographics of the city, there is a 22% chance that the attacker is male.
