To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's denote:
- F: probability of the attacker being female
- M: probability of the attacker being male
- p: probability of the witness correctly identifying a male
- q: probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male (witness thinks it's a female)

We know that:
- p = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
- q = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies male 20% of the time)
- F + M = 1 (total probability)

The witness's statement about gender identification accuracy assumes that the attacker's gender is independent of the witness's ability to identify it. In other words, the witness's error rate should apply to both male and female attackers.

The witness sees the attacker in the dark, which may make gender identification more challenging. Therefore, we can assume that the error rate (q) is equal for both genders.

Let's analyze the probability of the witness making a correct identification:

- P(witness identifies male) = P(attacker is male) * p + P(attacker is female) * q

Given that F + M = 1, we can write the equation as:

- P(witness identifies male) = M * 0.8 + (1 - M) * 0.2

We are given that the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, which can be written as:

- M * 0.8 + (1 - M) * 0.2 = 0.8

Now, we can solve for M:

- 0.8M + 0.2 - 0.8M = 0.8
- 0.2M = 0.0
- M = 0

However, since M must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1, the witness's observations don't provide sufficient information to determine the attacker's gender with certainty.

We can estimate the probability of the attacker being male using the population gender distribution in the city:
