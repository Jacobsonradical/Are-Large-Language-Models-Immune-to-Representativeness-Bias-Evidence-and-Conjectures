To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability.

1. According to the population statistics, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is male.
2. The witness's reliability is 80%, meaning they correctly identify gender in 80% of cases.
3. However, since we only know the witness's accuracy in a 50-50 gender split, we cannot directly apply this number to our situation where the attacker is more likely to be female (85% chance).
4. To account for this, let's assume that the witness's accuracy is lower when judging gender in a population where one gender is more prevalent. We can estimate this lower accuracy by considering how much the witness's error rate would increase when judging gender in a 85-15% female-to-male population.
5. Let's denote the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as "p". The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is "1-p".
6. Since the population is 85% female, the chance of the attacker being female is 0.85.
7. Given that the witness incorrectly identifies the gender 20% of the time, the probability of this happening when the attacker is female is 0.20.
8. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.
9. Since the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is "p", the probability of this happening when the attacker is male is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.
10. Given that the witness identifies the attacker as male, the likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability of this happening if the attacker is male to the probability of this happening if the attacker is female: 0.83 / 0.17 ≈ 4.88.
11. This likelihood ratio suggests that the witness's identification is much more likely to be correct when the attacker is male than when the attacker is female.
12. To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(Attacker is male | Witness's ID) = P(Witness's ID | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) / P(Witness's ID)
13. Since the witness's ID is "male", P(Witness's ID) is 1.
14. We can approximate P(Attacker is male) with the population statistics, 0.15.
15. Given the likelihood ratio and Bayes' theorem, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is male as: 0.83 * 0.15 / 1 ≈ 0.125, or 12.5%

In summary, given the population statistics and the witness's reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 12.5%. This estimate takes into account the witness's lower accuracy when judging gender in a population where one gender is more prevalent.
