To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given that 85% of the population in the city is female and 15% is male, and the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as follows:

1. The probability of a random person being male is 0.15 (15%).
2. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of them correctly identifying a male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error and incorrectly identified a female attacker as male. The probability of this happening is 0.85 (85% female population) * 0.2 (20% error rate) = 0.17 (17%).

Since we are given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can exclude the correct identification of a female as an option. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed male, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male and the probability of them incorrectly identifying a female as male, but excluding the latter:

Probability of male attacker = 0.12 (witness correctly identifying a male) + 0 (excluded incorrect identification of female as male)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12, or 12%.
