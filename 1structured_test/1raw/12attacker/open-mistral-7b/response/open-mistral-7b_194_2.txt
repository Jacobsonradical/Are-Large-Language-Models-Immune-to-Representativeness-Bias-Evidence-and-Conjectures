To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. According to the population distribution, 15% of the city's population is male.
2. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80% (correctly identifying gender), and 20% (erring in gender identification).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two scenarios:

a) The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender. In this case, the attacker is actually male (probability of this scenario = 0.8, the witness's accuracy rate).

b) The witness erroneously identified the attacker's gender. In this case, the attacker is actually female (probability of this scenario = 0.2, the witness's error rate).

Since we only have information about the attacker being identified as male, we can only consider scenario a. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate).
