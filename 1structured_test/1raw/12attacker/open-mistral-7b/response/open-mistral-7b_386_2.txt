To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since the attacker's gender was not seen directly, we can consider the witness's incorrect identifications as potential errors in this case.

Given that 85% of the population is female, and the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness misidentifying a male as a female.

Let's denote the probability of the witness misidentifying a male as a female as p. Then, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 1 - p.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, the proportion of females the witness mistakes for males is 0.2. Since there are twice as many females as males, the total number of incorrect identifications of males as females is 0.2 * (number of females).

The number of females is 0.85 * (total population), and the number of males is 0.15 * (total population). So, the total number of incorrect identifications of males as females is 0.2 * (0.85 * (total population)).

The total number of correct identifications of males is (1 - p) * (number of males), which is equal to (1 - p) * 0.15 * (total population).

The total number of identifications of males, both correct and incorrect, is 0.15 * (total population). So, the proportion of correct identifications of males is (1 - p) * 0.15 / 0.15, which is equal to 1 - p.

Given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is equal to the proportion of correct identifications of males. So, the probability that the attacker is male is 1 - p.

We know that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time. Since there are twice as many females as males, the total number of incorrect identifications of males as females is 0.2 * (number of females), which is equal to 0.2 * 0.85 * (total population).

We also know that the total number of identifications of males, both correct and incorrect, is 0.15 * (total population). So, the probability of the witness misidentifying a male as a female is the ratio of the number of incorrect identifications to the total number of identifications of males, which is equal to 0.2 * 0.85 / 0.15, which is equal to 16/25.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 1 - 16/25, which is equal to 9/25.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 9/25}.
