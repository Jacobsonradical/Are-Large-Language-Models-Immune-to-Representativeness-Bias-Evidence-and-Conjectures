Given the information provided, we can make an estimate by considering the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have any information about the gender of the attacker from the victim's perspective, we will rely on the witness's identification.

The witness identified the attacker as male, but there's a 20% chance that the witness made an error. If we assume this error occurred, then the attacker is actually female, contradicting the witness's statement. However, this scenario is unlikely given the city's gender distribution.

The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male. If we assume that the witness's error rate is representative of the city's gender distribution, then the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male is 15% (the male population percentage).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male minus the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male.

probability = 0.8 (witness's correct identification rate) - 0.15 (probability of witness's error in male identification) = 0.65

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.65 or 65%.
