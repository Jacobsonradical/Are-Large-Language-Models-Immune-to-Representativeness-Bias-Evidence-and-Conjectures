To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given about the witness's ability to judge gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- p: The probability that the attacker is male
- q: The probability that the attacker is female (1 - p)
- w: The witness's error rate in gender identification (20%)

The witness's ability to correctly identify the gender of an attacker can be modeled as a binomial distribution with n trials (where n is the number of people the witness has encountered), success probability p, and error probability w. Since we're given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, we can write the equation:

p * n + q * (n - 1) = 0.8 * n

We don't have enough information to solve for n directly, but we can manipulate this equation to find a relationship between p and q.

Let's assume there are 100 people in the sample the witness has encountered (n = 100). Then, we can solve for p and q:

0.8 * 100 = 80p + 100q - 100q
80p = 20
p = 0.25

Now, we need to consider the gender distribution in the city (b). If 85% of the population is female, then 15% is male (p = 0.15).

Given the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is male. However, we should note that the witness's ability to judge gender under night conditions is not fully accounted for in this analysis.
