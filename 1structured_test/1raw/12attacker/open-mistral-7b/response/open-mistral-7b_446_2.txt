To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an inference based on the witness's reliability and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information about how many times the witness observed a male and a female during the sample, so we can't directly apply these percentages to this specific case.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, it would seem more likely that the attacker is female based on this distribution. However, we are relying on the witness's identification, which has a 20% error rate.

Since we don't have enough specific data to make a precise calculation, a conservative approach would be to consider the attacker's gender as equally likely, given the witness's error rate. In this case, the probability of the attacker being male would be 0.5 (50%), as it is the midpoint between the observed gender distribution and the witness's error rate.

However, it is important to note that this is an estimation and not a definitive answer, as more information would be required to make a more accurate assessment.
