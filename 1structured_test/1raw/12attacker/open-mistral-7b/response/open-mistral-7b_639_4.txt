To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's error rate in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness errs in 20% of their gender identification, this means they correctly identify gender 80% of the time. Since the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male as follows:

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 15% (male population) * 0.8 (correct identification rate) = 12%.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness mistakenly identified a female as male. Since the female population is 85%, the probability of this happening is 85% * 0.2 (error rate) = 17%.

So, the total probability of the witness identifying a male, whether correctly or incorrectly, is the sum of these two probabilities: 12% + 17% = 29%.

However, we are not interested in the total probability of the witness identifying a male, but rather the probability that the attacker is actually male. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that their identification is either correct or an error. In this case, the probability that the attacker is male is equal to the probability of the witness's correct identification, which is 12%.
