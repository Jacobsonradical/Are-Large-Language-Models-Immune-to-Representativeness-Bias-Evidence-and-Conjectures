To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is male) given the evidence (witness identification)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (witness correctly identifying a male attacker)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being male before considering the evidence)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness making a correct identification in general)

We are given the following information:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to correctly identify gender)
- P(H) = Unknown (we need to estimate)
- P(E) = 0.8 * 0.5 (since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and half the population is male)

We are also given the gender distribution in the population:
- P(M) = 0.15 (probability of a male attacker, given that 15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (probability of a female attacker, given that 85% of the population is female)

So, we can rewrite P(H) as P(M) + P(F) = 0.15 + 0.85 = 0.95

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M|E) = P(E|M) * P(M) / P(E)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.5)
= 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12, or 12%.
