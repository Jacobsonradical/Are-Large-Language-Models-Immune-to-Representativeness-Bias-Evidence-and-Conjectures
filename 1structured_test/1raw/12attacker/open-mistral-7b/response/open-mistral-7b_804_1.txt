To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's gender identification.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male
- P(w) as the probability that the witness makes a gender identification (either correct or incorrect)

We are given the following information:
- P(M) + P(F) = 1 (since the attacker must be either male or female)
- P(w|M) = 0.8 (from the information about the witness's accuracy)
- P(w|F) = 0.2 (from the information about the witness's accuracy)
- P(F) = 0.85 (from the information about the city's demographics)

We are not given P(w), but we can find it by using Bayes' theorem for the other gender:
P(w|F) = P(F|w) * P(w) / P(F)
P(F|w) is the probability that the attacker is female given that the witness identified a person as male. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this means that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time. Therefore, P(F|w) = 0.2.

Now we can solve for P(w):
P(w) = P(w|F) * P(F) / P(F|w) = 0.2 * 0.85 / 0.2 = 0.85

Now we can find P(M) using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|w) = P(w|M) * P(M) / P(w) = 0.8 * P(M) / 0.85

We are asked for an estimate of P(M|w), so we can solve this equation for P(M):
P(M|w) = 0.8 * P(M) / 0.85
P(M) = 0.85 * P(M|w)

Since P(M|w) is a probability between 0 and 1, and P(M) is the ratio of P(M|w) to a constant (0.85), P(M) will also be a probability between 0 and 1. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.85 * P(M|w), please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Unfortunately, I cannot provide an exact number for P(M), as I do not have the value of P(M|w). However, I can tell you that the estimated probability that the attacker is male is proportional to P(M|w), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker, given the information from the night of the attack. This probability is given as 0.8 in the information, so the estimated probability that the attacker is male is likely to be relatively high, given the witness's accuracy.
