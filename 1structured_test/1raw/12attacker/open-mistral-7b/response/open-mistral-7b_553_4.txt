Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

1. We know from the first piece of information that the witness, who is able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time, identified the attacker as male.
2. However, we also know from the second piece of information that the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness would identify a male as male, which we know is 0.8.
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is male in the population, which is the unknown we're trying to estimate.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies anyone as male, which is the sum of the probabilities of a male being male (P(A)) and a female being mistakenly identified as male (P(not A) * P(witness mistakes female as male | not A)), where P(witness mistakes female as male | not A) is the error rate, which is 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can rearrange the equation to solve for P(A):

P(A) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]
P(A) = (0.8 * P(A)) / [(0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(A)))]

We can simplify this equation to:

P(A) = 0.8P(A) / [0.8P(A) + 0.2(1 - P(A))]

To find the value of P(A) that makes this equation true, we can solve it numerically or graphically. However, since the witness's error rate is relatively low (20%), it's reasonable to assume that the attacker was indeed male, as that was the witness's identification.

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.8}
