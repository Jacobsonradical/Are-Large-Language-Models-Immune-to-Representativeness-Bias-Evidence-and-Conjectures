To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the new evidence is the witness's gender identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is male) given the evidence (witness identification). This is what we want to find.
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time, so P(E | H) = 0.8.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. This is the probability of the attacker being male before considering the evidence. We don't have this information directly, so we'll estimate it using the gender distribution in the city. From the second piece of information, we know that 15% of the population is male, so P(H) = 0.15.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence. This is the probability of the witness making that identification, regardless of the gender of the attacker. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and there are equal numbers of males and females, we can assume that for each male the witness identifies correctly, there is a female she identifies incorrectly. So, there are 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4 correct female identifications for every correct male identification. Since there are 15% males, there must be 85% females, so there are 0.85 * 0.4 = 0.34 correct female identifications. Therefore, P(E) = 0.4 + 0.34 = 0.74.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
               = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.74
               = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%. This means that, given the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city, we should assign a 12% probability to the attacker being male.
