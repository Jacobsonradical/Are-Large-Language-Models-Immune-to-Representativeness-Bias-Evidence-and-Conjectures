Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population statistics and the witness's testimony.

1. From the population statistics, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. This means the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

2. However, we also have the witness's testimony, which suggests that the witness incorrectly identified the gender 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we need to account for the possibility that the witness was mistaken.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we can calculate the probability that the witness was correct in this case by multiplying the overall probability of the attacker being male by the witness's accuracy rate:

Probability of witness being correct = Probability of attacker being male * Witness's accuracy rate
                                                       = 0.15 * 0.8
                                                       = 0.12

Now, since the witness was incorrect 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability that the witness was mistaken by subtracting the probability of the witness being correct from 1:

Probability of witness being incorrect = 1 - Probability of witness being correct
                                                           = 1 - 0.12
                                                           = 0.88

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, and given that the witness was incorrect 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is actually female by multiplying the probability of the witness being incorrect by the overall probability of the attacker being female:

Probability of attacker being female given witness's testimony = Probability of witness being incorrect * Overall probability of attacker being female
                                                                                                     = 0.88 * 0.85
                                                                                                     = 0.7584

Given this calculation, it seems that the attacker is more likely to be female, despite the witness's testimony to the contrary. However, it's important to note that the witness's testimony introduces some uncertainty, and the actual probability could be slightly different depending on the specifics of the situation.

Strictly following the given information and calculations, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:
