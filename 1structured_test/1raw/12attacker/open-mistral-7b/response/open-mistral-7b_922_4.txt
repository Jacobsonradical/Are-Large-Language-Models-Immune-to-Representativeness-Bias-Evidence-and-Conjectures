Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the reliability of the witness and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't have information on how often the witness errs in favor of identifying someone as male or female. Let's assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the witness's errors are equally distributed between the two genders.

The witness identified the attacker as male. If the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, then the probability of the attacker being a female is 0.85. Since we assume the witness's errors are equally distributed, the probability of the witness erring and saying "male" when the attacker was really a female is 0.20.

The probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement is the probability of the witness being correct times the probability of the attacker being male, minus the probability of the witness erring and saying "male" when the attacker was really a female:

Probability of attacker being male = Probability of witness being correct * Probability of attacker being male
                                                   = 0.8 * 0.15
                                                   = 0.12

So, our estimate is that there is a 12% probability that the attacker is male.
