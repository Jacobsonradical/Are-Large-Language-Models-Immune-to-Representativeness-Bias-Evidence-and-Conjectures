To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error in this specific case. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of an error is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female attacker as male.

The probability of erring is given by the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 (or 20%).

However, we also know that the city has an 85% female population and a 15% male population. So, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is actually female is 0.2 (error rate) * 0.85 (probability of female attacker).

So, the probability of the witness identifying a female attacker as male is 0.17 (or 17%).

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is 1 - the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is female.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%).

Therefore, {probability: 0.83} is the estimated probability that the attacker is male.
