Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data: 1) The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and 2) the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Since the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is not dependent on the gender distribution in the population, we can use the witness's error rate to adjust the observed gender distribution.

The error rate is 1 - correct identification rate = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 20%. This means that the witness mistakenly identifies a person's gender 20% of the time.

To account for these errors, we need to multiply the observed gender distribution by (1 - error rate). For females, this would be 0.85 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.68 or 68%. For males, this would be 0.15 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.12 or 12%.

The witness reported the attacker as male, so we should use the adjusted proportion of males in the population as our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

So, {probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
