Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being male and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(B|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male.

Given the witness's accuracy, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Let P(B) be the probability that the witness identifies someone as male, which is the sum of the probabilities of them identifying a male correctly and a female incorrectly. Since the witness mistakes females for males 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2, and P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

Given that 85% of the population is female, P(not A) = 0.15.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.1 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.1 / 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.533

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.533 or 53.3%.
