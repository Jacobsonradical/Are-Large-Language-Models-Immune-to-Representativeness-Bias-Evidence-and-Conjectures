To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time.
2. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume that the witness's gender identification is unbiased and not influenced by the gender distribution in the city. In this case, the probability that the witness identifies a male as male is 15% (the actual percentage of males in the city), and the probability that the witness identifies a male as female is 85% (the actual percentage of females in the city).

However, we know that the witness makes errors in 20% of the cases. So, the actual probability that the witness mistakes a male for a female is higher than 85%. To find this probability, we can use the following formula:

Actual probability of mistake = Observed error rate * True probability of correct identification
                                            = 0.2 * 0.15
                                            = 0.03

Now, we can calculate the probability that the witness mistakes a female for a male:

Actual probability of correct identification = 1 - Actual probability of mistake
                                                           = 1 - 0.03
                                                           = 0.97

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male is 0.15 * 0.97 = 0.1455 (or 14.55%).

However, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Since the witness's gender identification is unbiased, this probability should be equal to the actual probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.1455 (or 14.55%).
