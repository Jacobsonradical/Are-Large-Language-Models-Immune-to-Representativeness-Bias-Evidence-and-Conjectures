Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender and a 20% error rate.
2. In the population, 85% are female and 15% are male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes known. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the hypothesis A given the evidence B.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the evidence B given the hypothesis A.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the hypothesis A.
- P(B) is the prior probability of the evidence B.

In our case:
- A is the attacker being male.
- B is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

We are given:
- P(B|A) is 1 (since the witness always correctly identifies a male as male).
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is male, which is what we want to find.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as male, given that they are either male or female.

We are also given that P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male), and P(B) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.8
P(A|B) = 0.1875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 18.75%.
