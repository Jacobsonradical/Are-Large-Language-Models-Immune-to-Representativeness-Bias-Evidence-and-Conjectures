To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness misidentifying a male as female. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this means that the witness correctly identifies a gender 80% - 20% = 60% of the time when that gender is actually in the minority.

In this case, since 15% of the population is male, the witness would correctly identify a male 60% * 15% = 0.09 * 0.15 = 0.0135 or 1.35% of the time when presented with a male.

However, since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, the attacker must be male in this case. So, the probability that the attacker is male is 1, or 100%.

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to identify gender is independent of the actual gender of the person. If the witness is more likely to make errors when identifying a minority gender, this could potentially lower the actual probability of the attacker being male. Without further information, it is impossible to account for this possibility.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male is 1 (or 100%), but this estimate is dependent on the assumption that the witness's ability to identify gender is not affected by the actual gender of the person. If this assumption is not valid, the probability could potentially be lower.
