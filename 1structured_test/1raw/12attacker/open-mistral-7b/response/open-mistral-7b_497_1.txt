Given the two pieces of information:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. (Information "a")
2. A witness, whose gender judgment accuracy is 80% and error rate is 20%, identified the attacker as male. (Information "b")

Let's break down this problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the prior probability of the attacker being male based on the city's population. Since 15% of the population is male, the prior probability is 0.15 or 15%.

2. Now, consider the witness's ability to accurately identify the gender of the attacker. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies it 20% of the time, we can say that if the attacker is actually male, the witness will correctly identify him as male with a probability of 0.8, and if the attacker is actually female, the witness will incorrectly identify him as male with a probability of 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (since there is a 15% chance of the attacker being female and a 20% chance of the witness mistaking her for a male).

3. The Bayes' theorem formula to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification is: P(Attacker is male | Witness's identification) = P(Witness's identification | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) / (P(Witness's identification | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness's identification | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female))

Substituting the values: P(Witness's identification | Attacker is male) = 0.8, P(Witness's identification | Attacker is female) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03, P(Attacker is male) = 0.15, P(Attacker is female) = 0.85

The final calculation is: P(Attacker is male | Witness's identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * 0.85)) = 0.12 or 12%

The estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 12%. This is lower than the 15% probability we calculated based on the city's population, indicating that the witness's identification might not be reliable enough in this case. However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to identify gender is independent of the attacker's gender, which may not always be the case.
