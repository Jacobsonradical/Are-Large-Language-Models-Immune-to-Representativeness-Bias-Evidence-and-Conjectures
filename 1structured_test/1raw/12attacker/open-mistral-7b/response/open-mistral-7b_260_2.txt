To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the city's demographic data and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80%, meaning they correctly identify gender 8 out of 10 times. However, they also err 2 out of 10 times.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:
   a) The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender, meaning the attacker is indeed male.
   b) The witness made an error, meaning the attacker is actually female.
4. To determine the probability of each scenario, we can use the witness's error rate.
   a) Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender (male) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy)
   b) Probability of the witness making an error (attacker is female) = 0.2 (witness's error rate)
5. Given that the attacker's gender is either male or female, these two probabilities must add up to 1. So, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male by subtracting the probability of the witness making an error from 1:

{probability: 0.8}

The attacker is estimated to be male with a probability of 80%.
