Given the information provided, we have a witness who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The population is 85% female and 15% male. However, the witness saw the attacker in the dark, which may have affected their ability to accurately determine the attacker's gender.

The probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's statement, can be calculated as follows:

1. The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time.
2. In the population, 15% of the people are male.
3. Therefore, the probability that the witness mistakes a male for a female is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (3%).
4. Conversely, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97 (97%).
5. Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, which is 0.97.

Answer: {probability: 0.97}
