The information provided can be broken down into two parts: the population demographics and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population demographics are that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness, in conditions similar to the night of the attack, correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that the witness's identification is correct in this case 80% of the time, given the information in part 2. However, we cannot ignore the possibility of the witness making an error, given part 2's information that the witness errs 20% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is female, we can assume that if the witness made an error, they would have mistakenly identified a female as male 20% of the time. However, the witness did not make such an error, so it suggests that the attacker is likely male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can calculate the product of the probability that the attacker is male based on the city's demographics and the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, given that the attacker is indeed male.

Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(W|M) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male. Then, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, given that the attacker is indeed male, is P(W|M).

We know that P(W|M) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy in part 2).

We also know that P(M) = 0.15 (from the city's demographics in part 1).

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, given that the attacker is indeed male, is given by the product of P(M) and P(W|M), which is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

However, since we cannot ignore the possibility of the witness making an error, we need to take that into account. The probability that the witness made an error and mistakenly identified a female as male is P(F) * P(W|F), where P(F) is the probability that the attacker is female, and P(W|F) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.

We know that P(W|F) = 0.2 (from the witness's accuracy in part 2).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we know that P(F) * P(W|F) < 0.15.

Given that P(F) * P(W|F) < 0.15, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker is male is greater than 0.12. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a precise numerical estimate for P(M).

{probability: greater than 0.12, but not precise due to lack of information}
