Given the information provided, let's reason through the problem:

1. We have a witness who, in general, misidentifies gender 20% of the time.
2. In the specific case of the attack, the witness identified the attacker as male.
3. In the city where the attack happened, 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.

Now, let's consider the possibility that the attacker is male. If the attacker is male, there's a 15% chance that the witness correctly identified the gender (since 15% of the population is male). On the other hand, if the attacker is female, there's a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify the gender as male (since the witness misidentifies gender 20% of the time).

The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male can be calculated as the sum of these two probabilities:

P(attacker is male | witness says male) = P(witness correctly identifies male) + P(witness incorrectly identifies female as male)

= 0.15 (probability of a male attacker) + 0.20 (probability of a female attacker times the probability of the witness's error)

= 0.15 + (0.85 * 0.20)

= 0.15 + 0.17

= 0.32

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
