Given the information provided, the probability of the attacker being male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, we have two hypotheses: the attacker is female (H1) and the attacker is male (H2). We also have two pieces of evidence: the population statistics (P(H1), P(H2)) and the witness's statement (P(evidence | H1), P(evidence | H2)).

Let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the population is female (P(H1)), and 15% is male (P(H2)).
2. The witness identified the attacker as male (P(evidence | H2) = 1). However, the witness's statement about the attacker being male is not 100% accurate, so we also need to consider the probability of the witness making a mistake. We're told that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time (P(not evidence | H2) = 0.2).
3. Since the witness could not see the attacker's gender, we can assume that the probability of the witness making the same mistake for a female attacker is the same as for a male attacker (P(not evidence | H1) = 0.2).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H2 | evidence) = [P(evidence | H2) * P(H2)] / [P(evidence | H1) * P(H1) + P(evidence | H2) * P(H2) + P(not evidence | H1) * P(H1) + P(not evidence | H2) * P(H2)]

P(H2 | evidence) = [(1 * 0.15)] / [((0.2) * 0.85) + (1 * 0.15) + ((0.2) * 0.85) + (0 * 0.15)]

P(H2 | evidence) â‰ˆ 0.21

So, based on this information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 21%.
