Based on the information provided, let's reason through this problem:
1. The witness has an 80% success rate in identifying gender.
2. The attacker's gender is unknown, but the city's population is 85% female and 15% male.
3. In this case, the witness is making a binary decision (male or female) based on limited information in low light conditions.
4. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 20% (1 - 80%).
5. Given the city's gender distribution, the probability of an attacker being female is 0.85 and the probability of an attacker being male is 0.15.
6. Since the witness's gender identification is not perfect, we need to consider the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male: 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (approximately 17%)
7. Now, there are two scenarios to consider: the attacker is actually male or the attacker is female and the witness erroneously identifies them as male.
8. The probability of the attacker being male is the sum of the probability of correctly identifying a male attacker (0.15) and the probability of incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male (0.17).

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 + 0.17 = {probability: 0.32, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.32.
