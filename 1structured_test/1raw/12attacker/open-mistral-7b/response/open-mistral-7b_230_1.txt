To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can consider two scenarios:

1. If the witness's gender judgment is completely reliable, then the attacker's gender should match the witness's statement. Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the attacker must be male in this scenario.

2. However, the witness's gender judgment is not 100% reliable, and there's a chance that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's gender. Let's calculate the probability of this error based on the witness's reliability rate. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so the error rate is 20%.

Given that the city has an 85% female population, the probability of the witness seeing a female attacker at night is 0.85. In this case, the witness would erroneously identify the female attacker as male with a probability of 0.20.

So, the combined probability of the witness making an error and identifying a female attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since we are considering two scenarios, we can now calculate the probability of the attacker being male by subtracting the probability of the witness making an error from 100%.

{probability: 100% - 17% = 83%, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
