To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population demographics and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. The population demographics indicate that 15% of the city's population is male.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying gender is that they correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

However, the witness's error rate is based on a 50-50 gender split, which is not the case in the city's population. To account for this, we need to adjust the witness's error rate.

The witness's error rate in the city's population can be calculated as follows:

1. If the attacker is male, the probability that the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as female is 20%.
2. If the attacker is female, the probability that the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as male is also 20%.
3. Since the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.
4. The probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is male is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03 (3%).
5. The probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is female is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (17%).
6. Since the attacker's gender is unknown, we can calculate the overall error rate by averaging the error rates for each gender: (0.03 + 0.17) / 2 = 0.105 (10.5%).

Now, with the adjusted error rate of 10.5%, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male based on the witness's testimony:

1. The witness identified the attacker as male.
2. Since the witness errs 10.5% of the time, there is a 100% - 10.5% = 89.5% chance that the witness's identification is correct.
3. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is the probability that the witness is correct times the probability of the attacker being male in the population: 0.895 * 0.15 = 0.134 (13.4%).

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.134 or 13.4%. Keep in mind that this is an estimation based on the given information and assumptions, and actual results may vary.
