To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. Based on population statistics, the probability of the attacker being male is 15%. This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of males in the population by 1 (since the event happens to one individual out of the total population): 0.15.

2. However, the witness's reliability in gender identification suggests that the actual probability may be different from the population statistics. The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. This means that when the witness identifies a person as male, there is a 20% chance that this person is actually female.

3. To incorporate the witness's reliability into our estimate, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker. If the attacker is actually male, the witness will identify him as male 80% of the time (correctly). So, the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies him as such is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

4. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness erroneously identifies a female attacker as male. If the attacker is actually female, the witness will incorrectly identify her as male 20% of the time. So, the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a female attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

5. Since the witness identifies the attacker as male, the actual probability that the attacker is male is the sum of the probabilities in steps 3 and 4, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

In conclusion, based on the provided information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 29%.
