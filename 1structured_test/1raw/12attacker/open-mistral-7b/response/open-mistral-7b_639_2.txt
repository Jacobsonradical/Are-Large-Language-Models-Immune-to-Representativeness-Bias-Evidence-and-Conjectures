To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

According to the given information, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we denote the true gender of the attacker as M (male) or F (female), and the witness's gender identification as W (correct) or E (error), we can represent the witness's performance as follows:

P(W|M) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker)
P(W|F) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male)

Since the witness could not see the attacker's gender, the prior probability of the attacker being male or female is equal. Therefore, P(M) = P(F) = 0.5.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male (P(M|W)) using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the given values:

P(M|W) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculating the probability:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4 or 40%.
