To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that relates two events A and B. In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

We are given the following information:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time)
2. P(A) = Unknown probability of the attacker being male
3. P(not A) = 1 - P(A) (the probability of the attacker being female)
4. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker 20% of the time)
5. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) (total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male)

From the information provided, we know that P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)). Since 85% of the population is female, we can assume that P(not A) = 0.85 and P(A) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Plugging these values into the equation for P(B), we get P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
          = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
          = 0.12 / 0.25
          = 0.48

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.48, or 48%.
