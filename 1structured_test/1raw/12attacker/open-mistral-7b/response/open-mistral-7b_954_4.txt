Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

Let's denote:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male

We are given the prior probability of A (P(A)) as 15% (since 15% of the population is male), and the conditional probability of B given A (P(B|A)) as 80% (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time). We are also given the conditional probability of B given not-A (P(B|not-A)) as 20% (the witness errs in 20% of the cases).

The probability of not-A (P(not-A)) is 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we find that the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.33 or 33%.
