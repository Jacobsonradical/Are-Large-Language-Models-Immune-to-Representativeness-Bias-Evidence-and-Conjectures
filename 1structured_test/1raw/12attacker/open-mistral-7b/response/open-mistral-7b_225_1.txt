Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the following variables:

- H: The event that the attacker is male
- E: The event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are given two pieces of information:

1. P(H) = 0.15 (from information b) - the prior probability of the attacker being male
2. P(E|H) = 0.8 (from information a) - the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker
3. P(E|~H) = 0.2 (from information a) - the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male

Since 85% of the population is female, P(~H) = 0.85 (from information b).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.1176

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 11.76%.
