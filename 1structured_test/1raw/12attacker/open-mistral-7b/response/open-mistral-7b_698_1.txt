To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make an assumption about the independence of the witness's gender identification accuracy and the actual gender of the attacker.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Assuming the witness's gender identification accuracy is independent of the actual gender of the attacker, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male attacker as a female.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, the probability of incorrectly identifying a male attacker as female is 0.2 (20%).

However, since there are more females in the city (85%), the probability of the attacker being female is higher than the probability of the attacker being male.

Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as male is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (80%).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as male, which is 0.8 (80%).
