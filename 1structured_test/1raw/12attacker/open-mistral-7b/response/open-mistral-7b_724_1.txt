Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given evidence (in this case, the witness's identification).

Here's how we can apply Bayes' theorem:

1. Define our hypothesis H (attacker is male) and complementary hypothesis ~H (attacker is female).
2. Define the prior probability P(H) = 0.15 (from information a).
3. Define the likelihood P(witness sees male | H) = 0.8 (from information b).
4. Define the likelihood P(witness sees male | ~H) = 0.2 (from information b).
5. The posterior probability P(H | witness sees male) can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(H | witness sees male) = [P(witness sees male | H) * P(H)] / [P(witness sees male | H) * P(H) + P(witness sees male | ~H) * P(~H)].

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H | witness sees male) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this value, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.16, or 16%.
