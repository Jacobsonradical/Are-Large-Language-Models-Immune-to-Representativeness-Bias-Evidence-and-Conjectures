To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence: the witness identified the attacker as male

We have two pieces of prior information:
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we want to estimate
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker being female

And we have one piece of evidence:
- P(E|H): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(E|~H): the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male

We are given the following information:

a) P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time)
b) P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male 20% of the time)
c) P(~H) = 0.15 (85% of the population in the city is female)

We don't have the exact value of P(H), but we can use Bayes' theorem to find it:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the given values:

P(H|E) = [0.8 * P(H)] / [0.8 * P(H) + 0.2 * 0.15]

We can't find the exact value of P(H) without more information. However, we can find a range of possible values for P(H) by considering the extreme values of P(H).

If P(H) = 0 (the attacker is definitely female), then P(H|E) = 0.

If P(H) = 1 (the attacker is definitely male), then P(H|E) = 0.8 / 0.8 = 1.

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the evidence, is between 0 and 1, with a possible value of 1 if the attacker is definitely male. We can't determine a more precise value without more information.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: between 0 and 1, with a possible value of 1 if the attacker is definitely male}
