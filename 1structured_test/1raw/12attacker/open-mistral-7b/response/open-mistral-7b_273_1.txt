Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The population breakdown in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate at identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

However, we should note that the witness's identification of the attacker as male is not based on the population statistics, but instead on their own observations. The witness's identification may or may not align with the city's population statistics.

Given this, we cannot directly use the population data to make a probability estimate. Instead, we can use the witness's accuracy rate to make an estimate.

The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender 80% of the time, and erred 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that the witness's correct identifications include the attacker being male.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, based on the witness's identification, is 0.8 (80%). This means that, according to the witness's identification, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is male.

However, this does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually male in the real world, as the witness's identification may not accurately reflect the gender of the attacker. Therefore, it is important to consider this estimate with caution and to consider other evidence or information that may be available.

In summary, the probability that the attacker is male, based on the witness's identification, is 0.8 (80%).
