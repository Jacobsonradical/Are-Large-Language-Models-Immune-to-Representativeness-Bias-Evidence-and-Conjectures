To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know the actual gender of the attacker, let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male).

Given that the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can represent this as P(female) = 0.85 and P(male) = 0.15.

Given the witness's ability to correctly identify gender, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male is P(witness says male | attacker is male) = 0.8. Similarly, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female is P(witness says male | attacker is female) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Since the witness said the attacker is male, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is actually male, given that the witness said so. This can be calculated as:

P(attacker is male | witness says male) = P(witness says male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) / (P(witness says male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness says male | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(male) = 0.15
P(witness says male | attacker is male) = 0.8
P(witness says male | attacker is female) = 0.17

P(attacker is male | witness says male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))

Calculating this gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, as approximately 0.3.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.3}
