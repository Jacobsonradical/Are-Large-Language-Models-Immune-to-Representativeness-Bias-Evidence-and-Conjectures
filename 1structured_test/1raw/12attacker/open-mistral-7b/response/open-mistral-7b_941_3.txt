Given the two pieces of information, we can break down the analysis into two parts:

1. The probability of an attacker being male in the city as a whole (based on the city's demographics). This is given as 15% in the first piece of information.

2. The probability that the witness misidentified the attacker's gender. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, this probability is 20%.

Now, we need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's gender. If the witness erroneously identified the attacker as male, then the actual attacker could be female. In this case, the probability that the witness's statement is incorrect given the actual attacker's gender is female would be 20%.

However, since we don't have enough information to determine the actual attacker's gender, we need to account for the possibility that the attacker is either male or female. So, we need to consider the probability that the witness made an error for both genders and then weigh these probabilities based on the city's demographics.

The probability of the witness making an error if the attacker is male is 20%. The probability of the witness making an error if the attacker is female is also 20%, since the witness's ability to identify gender is not gender-specific (assuming equal accuracy for both genders).

Since the city is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of an attacker being male is 15%, and the probability of an attacker being female is 85%. Therefore, the combined probability of the witness making an error if the attacker is male is 15% * 20% = 0.03, or 3%.

The combined probability of the witness making an error if the attacker is female is 85% * 20% = 0.17, or 17%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the total probability that the witness was correct given the attacker is female is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83, or 83%.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement. This is the probability that the witness made no error, which is the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male, multiplied by the probability of the attacker being male.

The probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80, or 80%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12, or 12%.

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 12%.
