Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, we have two hypotheses: the attacker is male (H1) or the attacker is female (H2). The evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

The prior probability of H1 (P(H1)) is not given, but we can estimate it using the population distribution. Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can estimate P(H1) as 0.15.

The likelihood of the evidence given H1 (P(E|H1)) is the witness's ability to correctly identify a male, which is 0.8. The likelihood of the evidence given H2 (P(E|H2)) is the witness's ability to incorrectly identify a male, which is 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of H1 as:

P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) * P(H1) / (P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H2) * P(H2))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H1|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives a probability of 0.38, or 38%.

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.38.
