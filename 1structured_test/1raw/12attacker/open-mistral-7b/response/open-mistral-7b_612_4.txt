To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given about the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male). We want to find P(male), given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

The witness incorrectly identified a female as male 20% of the time. Since the city has more females, there are more opportunities for the witness to make this mistake. Therefore, if the witness says "male," it's more likely that they are correct if the attacker is actually male; however, it's more likely that they are wrong if the attacker is female.

Let F be the probability of the attacker being female, and M be the probability of the attacker being male. We know that F + M = 1 (total probability).

We are given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Since the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time, we can set up a probability equation as follows:

P(witness said "male" | attacker is male) = P(correct gender identification) + P(witness error) * P(attacker is female)

Given the witness's accuracy rates, we can write this equation as:

0.8 = 0.8 * P(male) + 0.2 * F

We are also given the gender distribution in the city:

F = 0.15

Now we can solve for P(male):

0.8 = 0.8 * P(male) + 0.2 * 0.15

0.8 * P(male) = 0.6

P(male) = 0.6 / 0.8

P(male) = 0.75

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.75 or 75%.
