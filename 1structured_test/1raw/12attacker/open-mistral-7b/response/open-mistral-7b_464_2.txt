To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender and a 20% error rate. Since we don't have information about whether the witness's errors were more likely to be in identifying males or females, we'll assume that the error rate is evenly distributed. This means that the witness incorrectly identifies males as females 10% of the time and females as males 10% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of the witness seeing a male is 0.15. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time).

However, due to the witness's error rate, there's a chance that the witness identified a female as male. The probability of this error is 0.15 * 0.1 = 0.015 (1.5%).

So, the total probability of the witness identifying a male (either correctly or due to error) is 0.8 + 0.015 = 0.815 (81.5%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, and this identification has a 81.5% probability, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.815.
