Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and incorrectly identify gender is 20%.
2. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's first calculate the probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male. We can do this by multiplying the probability of the witness being wrong by the probability of the attacker being male:

Probability of misidentification = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male. This is simply the probability of the witness being correct minus the probability of misidentification:

Probability of correct identification = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Since we don't have any information about the witness's ability to correctly identify a female attacker, we can't make a similar calculation for a female attacker. However, we know that the witness was incorrect in 20% of their cases. Given that 80% of their guesses were correct, this means that 20% of their incorrect guesses must have been mistakes in identifying females as males.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being female as "p". Then the probability of the witness misidentifying a female attacker as male is p * 0.2.

Given that the witness was incorrect 20% of the time, we can write the equation:

0.2 = p * 0.2 + (1 - p) * 0.03

Solving for p, we get:

p = 0.85

Since the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85, the probability of the attacker being male is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

However, the witness identified the attacker as male. Therefore, we should use the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, which is 0.12.

So, our final estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.12}
