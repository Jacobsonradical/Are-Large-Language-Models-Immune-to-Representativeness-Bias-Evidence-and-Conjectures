Given the two pieces of information, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. This means that if we randomly select a person from the city, the probability of that person being male is 0.15 (or 15%).

2. A witness identified the attacker as male. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is only 80% accurate. This means that, even if the attacker was actually male, there's a 20% chance that the witness would have mistakenly identified someone else as the attacker.

3. Since we don't have any additional information about the attacker or the witness's judgement in this specific case, we can't rule out the possibility that the witness made a mistake. Therefore, we should consider the probability that the attacker is male to be less than 80%, the witness's accuracy rate.

Given these considerations, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker is male would be the product of the general population probability and the witness's accuracy, adjusted for the possibility of error. This would be:

0.15 (probability of attacker being male in the population) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12 (or 12%)

So, based on the information given, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 12%.
