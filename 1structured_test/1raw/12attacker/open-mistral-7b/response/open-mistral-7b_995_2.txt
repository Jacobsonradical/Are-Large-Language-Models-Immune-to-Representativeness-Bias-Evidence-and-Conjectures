Given the information provided, let's reason through the problem:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time.
2. We don't have specific information about how many people the witness saw that night, but we do know the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
3. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we can assume that their incorrect identifications will be evenly distributed between males and females, given the gender distribution in the city.
4. Therefore, the probability that the witness's incorrect identification of the attacker as male is due to an actual female attacker is 15% (the male population percentage).
5. The probability that the witness's correct identification of the attacker as male is due to an actual male attacker is 80% (the witness's correct identification rate).
6. To find the total probability that the attacker is male, we need to account for both the witness's correct identification and their incorrect identification due to a female attacker.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.84}

The estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.84 or 84%.
