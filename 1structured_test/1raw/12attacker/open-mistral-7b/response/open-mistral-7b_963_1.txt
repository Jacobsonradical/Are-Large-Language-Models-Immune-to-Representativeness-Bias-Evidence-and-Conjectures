To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information to know if their error rate is consistent between genders. Let's assume for now that the error rate is the same for both genders.

In the city, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male. The witness identified the attacker as male. Given that the witness's gender identification is not perfect, it's possible that the attacker is actually female, but the witness misidentified them as male.

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 80%. So, the probability that the witness is correct and the attacker is male is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate).

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness is wrong and the attacker is female. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability that the witness is wrong and the attacker is female is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

But wait, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female. So, if the witness is wrong, it's more likely that they misidentified a female as male rather than misidentifying a male as female, because there are more females in the city.

To account for this, we need to adjust our probability of the witness being wrong and the attacker being female. Let's call the probability of this event p. Since there are more females, we can assume that p is closer to 0.85 (the proportion of females in the city) than to 0.15 (the proportion of males in the city).

So, we can write an equation that represents the probability of the witness being wrong and the attacker being female as p = 0.15 * (1 - 0.8) + 0.85 * (1 - 0.80) = 0.15 * 0.2 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is male | witness's identification) = P(witness is correct and attacker is male) / (P(witness is correct and attacker is male) + P(witness is wrong and attacker is female))

= 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.17)

= 0.8 / 0.97

= 0.82

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city, is approximately 0.82 or 82%. This means there's an 82% chance that the attacker is male, given the information we have. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on certain assumptions and simplifications, and the actual probability might be different in reality.
