Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% while making errors 20% of the time. Since the attacker's gender was not clearly visible, the witness's judgment is the best estimate we have.

However, without knowing the exact number of males in the city, we cannot directly apply the witness's error rate to estimate the probability of the attacker being male. We can make an approximation by assuming that the number of males in the city is similar to the witness's error rate of 20%.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as p. Then, the probability of the attacker being female is 1 - p.

Given that the witness incorrectly identifies the gender 20% of the time, we can assume that the number of males in the city is approximately 15% (based on the information in "b"). This means that the number of females is approximately 85%.

Assuming that the witness's judgment is random, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is p, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is (1-p) * 0.2 (since 20% of the time, the witness mistakes a female for a male).

Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, we have the equation: p = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male) = 0.8 * Probability of attacker being male.

We can rewrite this as:

Probability of attacker being male = p / 0.8

Since we don't have a direct value for p, we can't provide a precise numerical value for the probability of the attacker being male. However, we can say that the probability is greater than 0 and less than 1, and it's approximately equal to the inverse of the witness's success rate (0.8).

In summary, {probability: approximately 0.125, this is an approximation based on the given information}
