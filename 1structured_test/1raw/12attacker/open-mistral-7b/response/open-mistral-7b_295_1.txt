Given the two pieces of information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The population distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, there's a crucial difference between these two pieces of information. The first one tells us the probability of the attacker being male in the general population, but the second one tells us the probability the witness will correctly identify a male attacker.

The witness's statement does not directly provide information about the probability of the attacker being male in this specific case. The witness could have mistakenly identified a female as male, which would mean the actual attacker is female, but the witness's error rate would still be 20%.

Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male in this specific case. The witness's statement does not provide sufficient evidence to override the population distribution.

In summary, {probability: cannot be determined with the given information, please do not provide a number} is the best answer. It's important to note that this answer assumes that the witness's error rate is constant and does not depend on the gender of the person they are observing. If that assumption is not valid, the situation becomes even more complex.
