Given the information provided, the attacker's gender was initially unknown to the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as male. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80% for a 50-50 gender split, meaning that they misgender 20% of the time.

Since 85% of the city's population is female, it would seem that the witness's identification of the attacker as male is more likely to be an error than a correct identification, given the city's gender demographics.

However, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender 80% of the time suggests that their error rate in this case might not necessarily reflect the city's gender demographics. Therefore, it's not straightforward to directly apply the city's gender demographics to this case.

Without more specific information about the witness's error rate in this particular case or the likelihood of a gender misidentification given the circumstances of the attack, it's not possible to provide a definitive probability estimate.

Therefore, based on the information given, I cannot provide a probability estimate in the strict dictionary format you requested.
