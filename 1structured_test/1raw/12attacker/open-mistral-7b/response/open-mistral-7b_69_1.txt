To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can say that the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

The witness was found to correctly identify gender 80% of the time, and err in 20% of the cases. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assign a likelihood to this event based on the witness's reliability.

The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 (80%), and the likelihood of the witness making an error (mistaking a female for a male) is 0.2 (20%).

However, since we don't have information about the gender the witness mistakenly identified in the 20% of incorrect cases, we cannot directly factor this into our calculation. Therefore, we will base our estimation on the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker.

The updated probability of the attacker being male, considering the witness's reliability, would be the product of the prior probability and the likelihood: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

However, the court's assessment suggests that the witness's ability to judge a person's gender under these conditions might be better than the 80% obtained in the sample. If we assume that the witness's ability is actually closer to 90% in this specific case, the likelihood of correctly identifying a male attacker would be 0.9.

The updated probability of the attacker being male, considering the improved likelihood, would be the product of the prior probability and the likelihood: 0.15 * 0.9 = 0.135 (13.5%).
