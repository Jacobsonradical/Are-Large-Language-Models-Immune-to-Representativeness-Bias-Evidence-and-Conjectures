Given the information provided, let's reason through the problem:

1. The witness has a 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's gender and a 20% chance of making an error.
2. We don't know if the witness made an error in this specific case, but we do know that the attacker's gender is either male or female.
3. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Given these facts, we can't definitively say that the attacker is male based on the witness's statement alone. However, we do know that the city has a higher percentage of females than males. So, it's more likely that the witness made an error and the attacker is female.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city. Let's assume that the witness made an error in this case and identified the attacker as male. The probability of this happening is the product of the witness's error rate and the probability of the attacker being female.

The probability of the attacker being female is the proportion of females in the city, which is 0.85.

So, the probability of the witness making an error and identifying the attacker as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

However, we don't know if the witness made an error or not. If the witness made no error, then the attacker is indeed male. The probability of this happening is the witness's correct identification rate, which is 0.8.

So, the probability of the witness making no error and the attacker being male is 0.8.

Given that we don't know whether the witness made an error or not, we should consider both probabilities and find their weighted average. The weight of each probability depends on its likelihood. Since the witness's error rate is higher, we should assign a higher weight to the probability of the witness making an error.

Let's assign a weight of 0.6 to the probability of the witness making an error and a weight of 0.4 to the probability of the witness making no error.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.6 * 0.17 + 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.51.

Therefore, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 51%.
