Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% success rate in identifying gender and a 20% error rate. However, we don't know the exact number of male and female attackers in this specific case.

If we assume that the number of male and female attackers is equal (which is not necessarily the case given the city's gender distribution), then the witness would be correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time, regardless of the attacker's gender.

However, the city's population is 85% female and 15% male. If we assume that the attacker's gender is randomly chosen from the city's population, then the attacker is more likely to be female (85%) than male (15%).

Given these two pieces of information, it's not possible to directly estimate the probability that the attacker is male without more information about the number of male and female attackers. However, if we were to make an educated guess, we might lean towards the attacker being female due to the city's gender distribution. But this is not a probability estimate and should not be used in any legal or statistical context.

In summary, based on the information provided, I cannot provide a probability estimate for the attacker being male.
