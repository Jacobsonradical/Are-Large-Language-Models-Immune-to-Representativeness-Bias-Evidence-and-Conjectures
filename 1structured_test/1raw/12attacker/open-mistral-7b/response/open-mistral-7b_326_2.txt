To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the population statistics and the witness's reliability.

1. Population statistics: The attacker could be either male (15%) or female (85%).

2. Witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, since the witness identified the attacker as male, we should consider the witness's error rate in identifying females as males. Given that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, and the population is 85% female, the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a female as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, it's more likely that the attacker is indeed male (15%) than that the witness made an error in identifying a female as male (17%). Therefore, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is male to be closer to 15% than to 17%.

However, this estimation is still not precise enough, as it only considers the two extremes of the witness's error rate. To get a more accurate estimate, we could use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability. Unfortunately, without more precise information about the witness's error rates in specific situations, we cannot perform this calculation.

So, providing a strict answer in the requested dictionary format, we have:
{probability: an estimate between 0.15 (15%) and 0.17 (17%), but closer to 0.15}
