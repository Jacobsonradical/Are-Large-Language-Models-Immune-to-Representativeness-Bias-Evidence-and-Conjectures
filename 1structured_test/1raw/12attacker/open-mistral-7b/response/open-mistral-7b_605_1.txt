Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider. The first piece of information (a) tells us that the city's population is predominantly female at 85%, with 15% being male. The second piece of information (b) tells us that the witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, but they err 20% of the time.

However, there's an additional factor to consider: the witness identified the attacker as male. This might seem to contradict the fact that the population is predominantly female, but it's important to remember that the witness's accuracy is only 80%. Therefore, even though the population is mostly female, there's still a chance that the witness could have identified a female attacker as male due to their error rate.

On the other hand, the witness's identification of the attacker as male aligns with the fact that men make up 15% of the city's population. This suggests that the attacker might be male, but we need to account for the witness's error rate.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male, and P(W|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is given as 0.8 (80%). Similarly, let P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female, and P(W|F) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is given as 0.2 (20%).

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability P(M|W) that the attacker is male given that the witness identified a male can be calculated as follows:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, our estimate, based on the given information and Bayes' theorem, is that the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 12%.
