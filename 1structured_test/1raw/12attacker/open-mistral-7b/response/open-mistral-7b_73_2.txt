To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and the error rate is 20%.
2. The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male.

We can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker as follows:

1. The probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 (15%).
2. Given that the attacker is male, the witness will correctly identify him 80% of the time. So, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker is (0.15) * (0.8) = 0.12 (12%).

On the other hand, we need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error and identified a female attacker as male. The probability that the attacker is female is 0.85 (85%). Given this, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female attacker as male is (0.85) * (0.2) = 0.17 (17%).

The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 (12%) + 0.17 (17%) = 0.29 (29%).

However, since the witness actually identified the attacker as male, we should consider this as evidence against the possibility of a female attacker. So, we subtract the probability of the witness erring from the total probability that the attacker is male: 0.29 (29%) - 0.17 (17%) = 0.12 (12%).

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 12%.
