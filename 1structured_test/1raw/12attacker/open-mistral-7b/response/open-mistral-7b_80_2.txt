Based on the information provided, there are two sources of probability to consider: the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. Population distribution: We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. This is the prior probability of the attacker being male.

2. Witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a male, they will correctly identify him as male 80% of the time, and when they see a female, they will incorrectly identify her as male 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the updated probability of the attacker being male. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis given some evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is "the attacker is male," and the evidence is "the witness identified the attacker as male."

Bayes' theorem is written as: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

Given that the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.
Given that the population is 85% female and 15% male, P(H) = 0.15.
Given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, E = "the witness identified the attacker as male."

To find P(E), we need to know the probability of the witness making this statement given that the attacker is female. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, they will incorrectly identify a female as male 20% of the time. Therefore, P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(E):
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(E) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29]
P(H|E) = 0.45

So, based on the provided information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.45 or 45%.
