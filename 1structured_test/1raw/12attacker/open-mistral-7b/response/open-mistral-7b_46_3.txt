To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume the witness saw the attacker and made a judgment. The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender as male is 0.8 (80%). Since there are more females in the city, there's a higher chance that the attacker is female. Therefore, the probability that the witness erroneously identified the attacker as male (given that the attacker is actually female) is higher than the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male (given that the attacker is actually male).

The probability that the attacker is female is 0.85 (85%), and the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying a female as male. So, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male (given that the attacker is female) is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

Now, let's find the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male (given that the attacker is actually male). Given that there are fewer males in the city, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 (15%). The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. So, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male (given that the attacker is actually male) is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).

However, we have more evidence that points towards the attacker being male. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually female is lower. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male must be higher than the 12% calculated above.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability of the attacker being male based on the new evidence. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, P(B|A) is the probability of B given A, P(A) is the prior probability of A, and P(B) is the probability of B.

In this case, A is the attacker being male, B is the witness identifying the attacker as male, P(A) is 0.15 (15%), P(B|A) is 0.8 (80%), P(B) is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A), where P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 0.17 (17%).

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)

Calculating this probability, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.23 (23%)

Therefore, based on the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 23%.
