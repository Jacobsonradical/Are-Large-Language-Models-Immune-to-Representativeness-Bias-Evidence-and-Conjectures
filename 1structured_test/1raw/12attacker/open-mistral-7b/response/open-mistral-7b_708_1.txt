Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

From the information given, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of the attacker being male is 15%)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) (the probability of the evidence, which is the witness's identification, can occur either if the attacker is male or if the attacker is female)

Since we don't have information about P(E|not H) (the probability of the witness correctly identifying the gender when the attacker is female), we cannot directly calculate P(E). However, we can still estimate the probability of the attacker being male by assuming that P(E|not H) is the same as P(E|H) (the witness's ability to judge gender is independent of the attacker's gender), which gives us:

P(E|not H) = 0.8

And:

P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

So:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.84

And finally:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.84 â‰ˆ 0.181

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.181 or 18.1%.
