To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and that 85% of the population is female, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male.

If the attacker is indeed female, the probability of the witness erring and identifying her as male is 20%.

Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85. So, the probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is 1 minus the probability of the witness erring:

{probability: 1 - 0.17 = 0.83, the attacker is likely male 83% of the time}
