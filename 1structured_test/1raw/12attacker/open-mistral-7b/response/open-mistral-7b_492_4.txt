Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

The formula is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male in this case)
- E is the evidence (the witness's identification and the city's demographic data)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate P(E|H):
The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. Therefore, P(E|H) = 0.8.

Second, let's calculate P(H):
Given that we have no prior information about the attacker, we can assume that before the incident, the probability of the attacker being male was equal to the proportion of males in the city. So, P(H) = 0.15 (15%).

Third, let's calculate P(E):
This is the probability of the witness making the same identification under the assumption that the attacker is male. Since the witness was correct 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, P(E) = 0.8 (the probability of correct identification).

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / (0.8)
P(H|E) = 0.15 / 1
P(H|E) = 0.15

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the evidence, is 0.15 or 15%.
