Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population statistics and the witness's identification.

1. According to the population statistics, 15% of the city's population is male. This is our prior probability.

2. The witness's identification of the attacker as male has an accuracy rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%. This means that in similar conditions, the witness correctly identifies a person's gender 8 out of 10 times.

If we assume that the witness's identification is independent of the population statistics (which may not be entirely true, but we'll use this assumption for simplicity), we can calculate the posterior probability as follows:

Posterior probability = (Prior probability * Conditional probability of evidence given prior probability) / Total probability of evidence

First, let's calculate the Total probability of the evidence:

Total probability of evidence = Prior probability * Conditional probability of evidence given prior probability + (1 - Prior probability) * Conditional probability of evidence given not prior probability

Substituting values, we get:

Total probability of evidence = (0.15 * 0.8) + (1 - 0.15) * (0.2) = 0.12 + 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.12 = 0.24

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

Posterior probability = (Prior probability * Conditional probability of evidence given prior probability) / Total probability of evidence
                         = (0.15 * 0.8) / 0.24
                         = 0.12 / 0.24
                         = 0.5

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.5 or 50%. This means that given the provided information, we are just as likely to believe that the attacker is male as we are to believe that the attacker is female.
