Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population demographics and the witness's testimony.

1. According to the population demographics (information "a"), 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. This would suggest a higher probability of a female attacker, given the city's gender distribution. However, this is only based on the general population and does not account for the specific circumstances of the attack.

2. Information "b" provides us with the witness's ability to accurately identify gender. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time. However, the witness identified the attacker as male, which is an error according to the population demographics.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = (P(E|A) * P(A)) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not-A) * P(not-A))

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker is male
- E is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (given by the population demographics)
- P(E|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker
- P(E|not-A) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male
- P(not-A) is the prior probability of the attacker being female

Given that we don't have the exact values for P(E|not-A) and P(not-A), we can't compute the probability exactly. However, we can make an approximation.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time (from information "b"), we can assume that P(E|not-A) is 0.2.

P(not-A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

So, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male as:

P(A|E) ≈ (0.2 * 0.15) / (0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.2)

P(A|E) ≈ 0.03 / 0.26

P(A|E) ≈ 0.115

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 11.5%. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate based on the given information and assumes that the witness's ability to identify gender is consistent in all situations, which may not be the case.
