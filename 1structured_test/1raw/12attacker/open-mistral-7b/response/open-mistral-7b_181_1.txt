Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the demographic data of the city and the witness's testimony.

1. Demographic data: The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. This suggests that the attacker is more likely to be female, given the city's gender distribution.

2. Witness testimony: The witness, who has a 80% success rate in identifying gender, incorrectly identified the attacker as male. This could be due to the poor lighting or other factors that made it difficult to perceive the attacker's gender accurately.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we should consider both pieces of evidence. We can do this by calculating the conditional probability of the witness's error given that the attacker is male, and comparing it to the conditional probability of the witness's error given that the attacker is female.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male,
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female,
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female,
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.

We know that P(w|M) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate for male individuals), and P(w|F) = 0.8 (the witness's error rate for female individuals). We also know that P(M) + P(F) = 1 (the total probability of the attacker being male or female).

Given these probabilities, we can set up a system of equations to solve for P(M):

P(M) * P(w|M) + P(F) * P(w|F) = P(w) (where P(w) is the total probability of the witness's error)

We're given that P(w) = 0.2 (the witness's overall error rate), so we can rewrite the equation as:

P(M) * 0.2 + P(F) * 0.8 = 0.2

Since we know that P(M) + P(F) = 1, we can rewrite the equation as:

0.2P(M) + 0.8(1 - P(M)) = 0.2

Simplifying the equation, we get 0.2P(M) = 0.04

Dividing both sides by 0.2, we find that P(M) = 0.2

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the available information, is 20%. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on certain assumptions about the witness's accuracy and the city's gender distribution, and there may be other factors that could influence the actual probability.
