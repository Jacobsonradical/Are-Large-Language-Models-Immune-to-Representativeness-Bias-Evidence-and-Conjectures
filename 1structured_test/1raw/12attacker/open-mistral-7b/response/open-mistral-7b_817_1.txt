To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability.

1. From the population statistics, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's reliability is given as 80% correct and 20% incorrect in identifying gender.

Let's assume that the witness's gender judgments are independent events. This means that their ability to correctly identify a person's gender does not depend on the gender of the previous person they judged.

Given these assumptions, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake by assuming the attacker is female (P(witness error | female attacker)) and then the probability of the witness making a mistake by assuming the attacker is male (P(witness error | male attacker)).

1. P(witness error | female attacker) = 20% (the witness's error rate)
2. P(witness error | male attacker) = 20% (the witness's error rate)

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the probability of this event given that the attacker is male. This probability can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is male | witness identified as male) = P(witness identified as male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) / P(witness identified as male)

1. P(witness identified as male | attacker is male) = 1 - 20% = 0.8
2. P(attacker is male) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)
3. P(witness identified as male) = P(witness identified as male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness identified as male | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(attacker is male | witness identified as male) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.12 = 0.8333 or approximately 83.33%

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 83.33%.
