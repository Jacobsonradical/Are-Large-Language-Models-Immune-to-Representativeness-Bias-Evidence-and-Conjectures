To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, the witness's error rate does not account for the possibility of mistakenly identifying a female as male, which is not mentioned in the information provided. Since the witness's error rate is based on a 50%-50% gender split, it may not accurately reflect the witness's performance in a city where the gender distribution is skewed.

Given the limited information, it is not possible to provide a reliable probability estimate. A more accurate estimate would require additional information about the witness's error rate when identifying gender in a city with a skewed gender distribution.
