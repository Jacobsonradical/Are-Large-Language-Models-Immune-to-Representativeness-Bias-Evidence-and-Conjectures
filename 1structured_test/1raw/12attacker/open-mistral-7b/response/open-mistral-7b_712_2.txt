To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. According to the population distribution (information "a"), 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. However, the witness's reliability (information "b") is not perfect. In a sample of people, half female and half male, the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

3. Since we don't know the gender of the attacker, the witness's statement could be an error. We should consider both possibilities - that the witness was correct and that the witness was wrong.

4. If the witness was correct, then the attacker is indeed male. The probability of this event is given by the witness's reliability (0.8).

5. If the witness was wrong, then the attacker is female. The probability of this event is 1 minus the witness's reliability (1 - 0.8 = 0.2).

6. Since the population is heavily female (85%), it's more likely that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually female. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male (given the witness's statement) is lower than the population distribution would suggest.

7. To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(Male|Witness's statement) = P(Witness's statement|Male) * P(Male) / [P(Witness's statement|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness's statement|Female) * P(Female)]

8. We know P(Male) = 0.15, P(Witness's statement|Male) = 0.8, and P(Witness's statement|Female) = 0.2 (from information "b"). Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we find: P(Male|Witness's statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12

So, based on the information given, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
