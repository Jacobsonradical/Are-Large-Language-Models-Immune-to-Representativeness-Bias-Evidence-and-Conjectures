Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% (with a 20% error rate).
2. The population distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us calculate the probability of a hypothesis given evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement that the attacker is male.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male
- P(H): the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability that the attacker is male in the city population)
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(H|E): the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement)
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female)
- P(~H): the prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis (the probability that the attacker is not male in the city population)

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

From the information provided, we can compute the following probabilities:

- P(H): 15% (since 15% of the city population is male)
- P(E|H): 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(~H): 85% (since 85% of the city population is female)
- P(E|~H): 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.167

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 16.7%.
