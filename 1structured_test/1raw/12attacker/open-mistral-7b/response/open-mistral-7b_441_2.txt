To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- p: probability that the attacker is male
- q: probability that the attacker is female (1 - p)
- E: error rate of the witness (20%)

We have two pieces of information:
1) The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. This means that the sum of the probabilities of him correctly identifying a male and a female is 80%. So, we have the equation: p * (1-E) + q * E = 0.8
2) The population is 85% female (q) and 15% male (p).

From the second piece of information, we can say that p = 0.15. Now, we can substitute p into the first equation to solve for q:
0.15 * (1-0.2) + q * 0.2 = 0.8

Solving for q, we get: q = 0.71

Now, we can use these values to estimate the probability that the attacker is male:

{probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
