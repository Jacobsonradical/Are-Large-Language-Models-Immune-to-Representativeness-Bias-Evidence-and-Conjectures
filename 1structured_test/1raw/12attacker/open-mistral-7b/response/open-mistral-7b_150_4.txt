Given the two pieces of information, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. This means that if a random person is chosen from the city, the probability of that person being male is 15/100 or 0.15.

2. A witness identified the attacker as male, but their ability to correctly identify gender is only 80% accurate, meaning they err 20% of the time. This means that even if the attacker was actually female, there's a 20% chance that the witness would mistakenly identify them as male.

3. However, we can't ignore the fact that the city has a gender ratio of 85% female to 15% male. If the witness is incorrect, it's more likely that they're misidentifying a female as male than a male as female, because there are more females in the city.

To calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification, we need to consider both the city's gender ratio and the witness's error rate. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male).

Given that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the probability that they're wrong and identifying a female as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%). This means that there's a 17% chance that the witness is mistakenly identifying a female as the attacker.

Since there are more females in the city, it's more likely that the witness is misidentifying a female than a male. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is less than 0.15 (the city's male population percentage).

However, without more information, it's impossible to provide an exact number. We can only say that the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is less than 0.15, but greater than 0.15 * 0.83 (the probability of the witness's error being a false positive given a female attacker).

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: less than 0.15, but greater than 0.15 * 0.83}
