To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the witness made an error in this specific case, we should consider both possibilities: the attacker is male and the witness correctly identified him, or the attacker is not male and the witness made an error.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male), and the probability that the attacker is not male as P(not male).

The witness correctly identified the attacker as male with probability P(male). Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the probability that the witness made an error and said the attacker was male when he was not is 0.2 * P(not male).

Given that the witness said the attacker was male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(male | witness's statement) = P(male) + P(not male) * 0.2

We know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. This means P(not male) = 0.15.

Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:

P(male | witness's statement) = P(male) + 0.15 * 0.2

Since the total probability of the two outcomes should sum to 1, we can rewrite this equation as:

P(male) = P(male | witness's statement) - 0.15 * 0.2

We are given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so P(male | witness's statement) = 0.8.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(male) = 0.8 - 0.03

P(male) = 0.77

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.77, or 77%.
