To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness was found to correctly identify gender 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information to determine if the witness's error rate is higher for misidentifying females as males or vice versa. Let's assume, for simplicity, that the error rate is equal for both genders.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of a randomly selected person being male is 0.15. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 0.20.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is then 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

However, since the witness identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is actually male given that the witness made this identification. This is a conditional probability, which can be calculated as follows:

P(attacker is male | witness identified as male) = P(witness identified as male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) / P(witness identified as male)

Given the witness's error rate of 20%, this can be approximated as:

P(attacker is male | witness identified as male) â‰ˆ 0.80 * 0.15 / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)

Calculating this, we get a probability of approximately 0.63, or 63%.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.63, or 63%.
