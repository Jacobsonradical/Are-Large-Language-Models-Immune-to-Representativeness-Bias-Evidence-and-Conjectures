To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and the city has an 85% female population, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male is 20%.

On the other hand, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male is 80%. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is the probability that the witness correctly identified a male, which is 0.8 (80%).

However, we cannot ignore the possibility that the witness made an error and misidentified a female as male. In this case, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.15 (15%), which is the actual proportion of males in the city.

The probability that the witness made an error and misidentified a female as male is 0.2 (20%), as stated earlier.

Given these probabilities, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male considering the possibility of a misidentification by the witness.

The probability that the attacker is male (P(male)) is the sum of the probability that the witness correctly identified a male (P(wc|male)) and the probability that the witness made an error and misidentified a female as male (P(wc|female) * P(female)), weighted by their respective probabilities:

P(male) = P(wc|male) * P(male) + P(wc|female) * P(female)

Plugging in the values:

P(male) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

P(male) = 0.12 + 0.1765

P(male) = 0.2965

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, considering the witness's reliability and the actual gender distribution in the city, is approximately 0.2965 or 29.65%.
