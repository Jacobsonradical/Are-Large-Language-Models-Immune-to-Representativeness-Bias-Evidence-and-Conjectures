To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. According to the population distribution (information point "a"), 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. Information point "b" tells us that the witness has an 80% success rate in identifying gender, but also makes an error 20% of the time.

Since we don't know the actual gender of the attacker, we can't directly use the witness's success rate. However, we can look at how often the witness would identify a male attacker if the attacker was indeed male.

Given that the attacker is male, there's a 100% chance that the witness will see a male. If the witness is reliable, they will correctly identify the attacker as male 80% of the time. But due to their 20% error rate, they will mistakenly identify the attacker as female 20% of the time.

So, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker is 0.8 (the success rate), and the probability that they incorrectly identify a male attacker as female is 0.2 (the error rate).

Since we don't know the actual gender of the attacker, but the witness identified the attacker as male, we should consider both the probability of the witness being correct and the probability of their error.

The probability that the witness is correct in their identification is the probability that the attacker is male multiplied by the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker:

P(witness is correct) = P(attacker is male) * P(witness correctly identifies male)
                                       = 0.15 (probability of male in population) * 0.8 (witness success rate)
                                       = 0.12

The probability that the witness is incorrect and has erroneously identified a female attacker as male is the probability that the attacker is female multiplied by the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female attacker as male:

P(witness is incorrect) = P(attacker is female) * P(witness mistakenly identifies female as male)
                                             = 0.85 (probability of female in population) * 0.2 (witness error rate)
                                             = 0.17

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can now calculate the overall probability that the attacker is male by adding the probabilities of the witness being correct and the witness being incorrect:

P(attacker is male) = P(witness is correct) + P(witness is incorrect)
                                 = 0.12 + 0.17
                                 = 0.29

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%.
