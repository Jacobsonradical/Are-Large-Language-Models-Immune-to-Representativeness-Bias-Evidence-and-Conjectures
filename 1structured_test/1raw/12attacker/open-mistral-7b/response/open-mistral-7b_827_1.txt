To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have specific information about the gender of the victim, we'll assume that the attacker could be either male or female.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of a randomly chosen person being female is 0.85. The probability of a randomly chosen person being male is then 0.15 (1 - 0.85).

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, in 20% of the cases where the actual gender is not male, the witness will mistakenly identify the person as male. This happens when the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.

The probability of a mistaken identification (where the actual gender is female) is 0.2 (the error rate). So, the number of times the witness identifies a female as male is 0.2 * 0.85 (the probability of choosing a female).

The total number of times the witness identifies a person as male is the sum of the times the witness correctly identifies a male and the times the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male.

So, the total number of times the witness identifies a person as male is 0.8 (correction rate) * 0.15 (probability of choosing a male) + 0.2 * 0.85 (probability of choosing a female).

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male. This is simply the proportion of times the witness identifies a male, from among the true males:

(0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

This gives us an estimate of 0.12, or 12%. However, since the witness also errs in identifying females as males, the actual probability of the attacker being male is higher than this.

To find this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male and P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female. We know P(F) = 0.85.

The witness's statement tells us that P(M|W) = 0.8 (the correction rate) * P(M) + 0.2 * P(F).

We also know that P(W) = P(M) + P(F) = 1, so we can rewrite P(M|W) as:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * P(M)) / P(W)

Substituting P(W) = 1 and solving for P(M), we get P(M) = 0.12 / 0.8 = 0.15.

So, based on the witness's statement and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 15%.
