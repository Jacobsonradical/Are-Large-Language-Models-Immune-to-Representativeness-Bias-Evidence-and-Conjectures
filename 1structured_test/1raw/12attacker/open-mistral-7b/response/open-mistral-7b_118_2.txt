Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The population distribution of the city, which is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender, which is 80% accurate. However, the witness also makes errors 20% of the time.

The witness's statement that the attacker is male contradicts the population distribution, so we should rely more on the witness's ability to identify gender accurately.

The probability that the witness is incorrect in their gender identification is 20%. Since the population distribution suggests a 15% probability that the attacker is male, it means that there is a 85% chance that the attacker is female according to the population distribution.

Given that the witness is incorrect in 20% of their gender identifications, the probability that the witness is incorrect in this case is 0.20. This means that the probability that the witness is correct and the attacker is indeed male is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

However, the population distribution suggests a lower probability of the attacker being male. To reconcile these two pieces of information, we can calculate the weighted probability of the attacker being male based on both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy.

Let P(male) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(witness) be the probability that the witness is correct. We can write an equation based on the given information:

0.85 * P(female) + 0.80 * P(male) = 1

Solving for P(male), we get:

P(male) = (1 - 0.85) / (0.80 - 0.85) = 0.22

Therefore, based on both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.22 or 22%.
