Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:
1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.

Let's assume that the attacker is actually female. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as male would be the witness's error rate, which is 20%.

On the other hand, if the attacker is male, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender would be the witness's success rate, which is 80%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male based on these two possibilities. Let's call the probability of the attacker being male P(M).

We know that the probability of the witness making an error, given that the attacker is female, is 0.2. This can be written as P(M|F) = 0.2.

Similarly, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender, given that the attacker is male, is 0.8. This can be written as P(M|M) = 0.8.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(M) as follows:

P(M) = P(M|F) * P(F) / [P(M|F) * P(F) + P(M|M) * P(M)]

Where P(F) represents the probability of the attacker being female, which can be calculated as 1 - P(M) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is female).

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M) = 0.2 * 0.15 / (0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.15)

Calculating this, we find that P(M) â‰ˆ 0.196

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony and the city's gender distribution, is approximately 19.6%.
