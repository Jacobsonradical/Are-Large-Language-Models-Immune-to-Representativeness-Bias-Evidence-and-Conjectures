To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

From the information provided, we know that:
1. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time but errs 20% of the time.

However, since the witness misidentified the attacker's gender, we should consider the witness's error rate. If the witness errs 20% of the time, that means they correctly identify the gender 80% of the time. So, if the attacker is actually female, there's a 20% chance the witness will mistakenly identify them as male.

Now, let's think about the scenario where the attacker is male. In this case, the witness will correctly identify the gender 80% of the time, and we're dealing with the actual population distribution of 15% males and 85% females.

Since the witness misidentified the attacker as male, we should consider both the possibility that they were correct (the attacker is actually male) and the possibility that they were wrong (the attacker is actually female, and the witness misidentified them).

The probability of the witness being correct is the probability that the attacker is male (P(male)) multiplied by the witness's success rate in identifying males (0.8). The probability of the witness being wrong is the probability that the attacker is female (P(female)) multiplied by the witness's error rate in identifying females (0.2).

We can write this as a probability equation:

P(male | witness's statement) = P(male) * 0.8 + P(female) * 0.2

We can rewrite this equation using the given gender distribution in the city:

P(male | witness's statement) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2

Calculating this equation, we get:

P(male | witness's statement) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
