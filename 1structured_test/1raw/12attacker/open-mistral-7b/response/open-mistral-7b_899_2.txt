To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the known gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, we can assume that the majority of people the witness encounters are female. Therefore, the witness is more likely to err when identifying a male, as they are less common.

Let's denote the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as M, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as F. We know that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male (F) is equal to the probability of the witness correctly identifying a female (M) multiplied by the ratio of females to males in the city (85/15):

F = M * (85/15)

We also know that the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male (M) is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male (F) is 0.2. We can set up an equation using these probabilities and the relation we derived above:

0.2 = 0.8 * M * (85/15)

Solving for M, we get:

M â‰ˆ 0.16

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 16%.
