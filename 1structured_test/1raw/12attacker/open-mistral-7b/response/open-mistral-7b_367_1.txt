Given the two pieces of information, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The population distribution of males and females in the city. We know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.

2. The reliability of the witness in identifying gender. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, there's an important difference between these two pieces of information. The first one is about the population distribution, which is an absolute fact, while the second one is about the witness's ability to make a correct judgment, which is a relative probability.

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender does not necessarily reflect the actual gender distribution in the population. For example, if the witness is biased towards thinking that people are male, they might incorrectly identify females as males more often than males as females, even if the actual gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male.

Therefore, we cannot directly use the witness's error rate to estimate the probability that the attacker is male based on the population distribution.

The question asks for an estimate, but without more information, such as the witness's bias or the specific context of the attack, it's not possible to provide a reliable estimate. Therefore, I must answer in the following dictionary format:

{probability: Unable to provide a number, more information is needed}
