To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errors 20% of the time, and we know that 85% of the population is female, the probability of the witness misidentifying a male as female is 20%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identified a male, which is 1 - the probability of the witness misidentifying a male.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.8 - 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.71, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
