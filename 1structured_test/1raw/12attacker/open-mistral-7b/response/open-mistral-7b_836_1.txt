To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male as male (P(E | H)):
Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the probability of correctly identifying a male is 0.8, and the probability of erring and identifying a male as female is 0.2.

Thus, P(E | H) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)):
Since we know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the evidence (P(E)):
This is the probability of the witness identifying a person as male, regardless of whether the person is actually male or female. Since the witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the probability of the witness identifying a person as male is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.13.

Finally, let's calculate the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (P(H | E)):

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)
P(H | E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.13
P(H | E) = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12, or 12%.
