To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can consider the two pieces of information provided:

1. The population statistics given in "a" indicate that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male.
2. The witness's ability to judge gender correctly was 80% and incorrectly 20% as stated in "b".

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of this event happening by chance (if the attacker is actually female) can be calculated as the error rate of the witness (20%).

However, we should also consider the possibility that the witness's identification is influenced by the city's gender population distribution. In this case, the actual probability of the attacker being male is higher than the 85% female population percentage, but lower than the 100% of the witness's identification.

To account for this influence, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error given that the attacker is female by multiplying the female population percentage (0.85) by the error rate of the witness (0.20) and then subtract this value from the witness's identification (1).

The probability of the attacker being male (P(male)) can then be calculated as:

P(male) = 1 - P(witness identifies female | attacker is female)

So,

P(male) = 1 - (0.85 * 0.20)

P(male) â‰ˆ 0.91

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 91%.
