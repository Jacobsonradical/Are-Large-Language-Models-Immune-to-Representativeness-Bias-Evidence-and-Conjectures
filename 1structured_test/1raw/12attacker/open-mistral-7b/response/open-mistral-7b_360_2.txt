To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. From the population distribution, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, the witness's identification was not always correct. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can't simply use the population distribution without considering the witness's error rate. The witness's mistake rate means that even if the actual attacker was female, there's a chance the witness would still identify them as male.

To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness's mistake given that the attacker is female. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, this probability is 0.20 or 20%.

Then, to find the probability that the attacker is male, we subtract this probability of a false positive (witness misidentifying a female as male) from the total probability of the attacker being male in the population.

Final answer: {probability: 0.15 * (1 - 0.20) = 0.12, the attacker is likely male with a probability of 12%}
