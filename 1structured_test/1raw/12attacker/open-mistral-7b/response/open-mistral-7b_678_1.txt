Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.

The witness's statement that the attacker is male can be either correct or incorrect. If it's correct, then the attacker is indeed male. If it's incorrect, then the attacker is female.

The probability that the witness's statement is correct is 0.8 (80%), and the probability that it's incorrect is 0.2 (20%).

However, we need to account for the fact that the city has a male population of 15%. If the witness is incorrect, it means the attacker is actually female, but since the city is predominantly female, it's more likely that the witness made an error rather than that the attacker is female.

So, the probability that the witness's statement is incorrect and the attacker is female is not just 0.2, but slightly less. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness's Statement) = P(Witness's Statement | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male) / [P(Witness's Statement | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male) + P(Witness's Statement | Attacker is Female) * P(Attacker is Female)]

P(Witness's Statement | Attacker is Male) = 0.8 (probability the witness correctly identifies a male)
P(Witness's Statement | Attacker is Female) = 0.2 (probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
P(Attacker is Male) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
P(Attacker is Female) = 0.85 (the population is 85% female)

Calculating the probability P(Witness's Statement | Attacker is Female) * P(Attacker is Female) gives us 0.168, and the probability of the whole equation gives us:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness's Statement) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12

So, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12. This means there's a 12% chance that the witness's statement is correct and the attacker is indeed male. However, the witness's statement is likely to be incorrect, and if it is, the attacker is likely to be female.
