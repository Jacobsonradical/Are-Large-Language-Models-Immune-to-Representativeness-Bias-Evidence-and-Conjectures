To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- e as the error rate of the witness (1 - the probability of correct identification)

We know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so e = 0.2. We also know that 85% of the population is female, so P(F) = 0.85.

The witness mistakes a female for a male with a probability of e, and a male for a female with the same probability e. Since there are equal numbers of males and females, the probability of the witness mistaking a male for a female is the same as the probability of mistaking a female for a male. Therefore, e = P(M) * 0.2 = P(F) * 0.2.

Solving this equation for P(M), we get:

P(M) = P(F) * 0.2 / e
        = 0.85 * 0.2 / 0.2
        = 0.85

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.85.
