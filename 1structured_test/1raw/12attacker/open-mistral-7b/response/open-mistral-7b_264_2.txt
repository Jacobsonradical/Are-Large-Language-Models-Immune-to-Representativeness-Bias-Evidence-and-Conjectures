To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

The witness's mistake rate is equal for both genders, as stated in the information. Therefore, when the witness makes an error, they are equally likely to mistake a male for a female as they are to mistake a female for a male.

Let's denote:
- p: the probability that the attacker is male
- q: the probability that the attacker is female
- e: the probability of the witness making an error

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, e = 0.2.

Given that the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, we can write the following equation:
p + q = 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being male)

We also know that the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender is 0.8. This means that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's gender (either as female when the attacker is male, or as male when the attacker is female) is 0.2.

So we can write another equation:
p * (1 - e) + q * e = 0.2

To solve these two equations, we can substitute p = 0.15 - q into the second equation:
(0.15 - q) * (1 - 0.2) + q * 0.2 = 0.2

Now we have:
0.12 - 0.15q + 0.2q = 0.2

Combining the terms with q gives:
0.05q = 0.08

Solving for q, we get:
q = 0.16

Substituting q back into the first equation, we find:
p = 0.15 - 0.16 = 0.01

So the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 1%. However, given the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city, it seems unlikely that the attacker is male with such a low probability. It might be worth reconsidering the information or the assumptions made to arrive at this result.
