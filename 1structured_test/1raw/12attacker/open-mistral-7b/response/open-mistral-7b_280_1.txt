To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided and make some assumptions.

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. A witness identified the attacker as male, but their ability to correctly identify gender is only 80% accurate.

Let's assume that the witness's gender identification accuracy is independent of the actual gender distribution in the city. This means that the witness's mistake rate of 20% is constant regardless of whether they are looking at a female or a male.

Given this assumption, the witness's identification of the attacker as male does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually male. It only means that the witness made a correct identification in this particular case with a probability of 0.8 (80%).

Since the actual gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 (15%). However, this probability does not take into account the witness's error rate.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the gender 20% of the time, the probability that they correctly identified a female as a male is also 0.2 (20%). This means that there is a 0.2 chance that the witness's identification of the attacker as male is actually a mistake, and the attacker is actually female.

Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is male, considering both the actual gender distribution and the witness's error rate, is the sum of the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identified it (0.15) and the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female as male (0.2):

{probability: 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.27}

So, based on the given information and assumptions, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 27%.
