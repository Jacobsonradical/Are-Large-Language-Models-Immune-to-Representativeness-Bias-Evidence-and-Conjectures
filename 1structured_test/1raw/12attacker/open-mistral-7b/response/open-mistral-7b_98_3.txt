Given the information provided, we have two sources of data: the city's population statistics and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. The city's population statistics indicate that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. However, this does not directly apply to the attacker's gender since the witness's identification is what we are interested in.

2. The witness's reliability is that they correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can consider this as a successful identification by the witness. However, we should account for the possibility of the witness making an error, given their statistical reliability.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the witness's success rate in identifying males, which is 80%. However, we should also consider the probability of the witness making an error and mistakenly identifying the attacker as male, which is their error rate, which is 20%.

The attacker being a female and the witness mistakenly identifying the attacker as a male is an error, and this error happens 20% of the time.

So, the probability that the attacker is actually male, given the witness's identification, is the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male (which is 80%) and the probability of the witness making an error (which is 20%).

In mathematical terms, this can be represented as:

{probability: 0.8 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.85) = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.8 + 0.025 = 0.825}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is approximately 0.825 or 82.5%.
