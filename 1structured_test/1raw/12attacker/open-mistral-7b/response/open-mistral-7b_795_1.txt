To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness's gender identification is not 100% accurate, with an error rate of 20%. This means that if the attacker's gender is actually female, the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as male 20% of the time.

However, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female. If the attacker is actually female, the probability that the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17, or 17%.

On the other hand, if the attacker is actually male, the witness will correctly identify the attacker as male 80% of the time.

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is the probability of a correct identification (80%) plus the probability of an incorrect identification of a female attacker (17%), multiplied by the probability that the attacker is male in the population (15%).

In mathematical terms:

{probability: 0.8 + 0.17 * (1 - 0.85) * 0.15 = 0.54}

So, our estimate is that the attacker is likely male with a probability of 54%.
