The given information can be broken down into two parts: the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. Population distribution: The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.
2. Witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as male. However, given that the victim could not see the attacker's gender and the witness's error rate of 20%, there's a possibility that the witness made an error.

To find the probability that the attacker is indeed male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's error rate.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(Correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(Incorrect) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male

From the population distribution, P(F) = 0.15.
From the witness's reliability, P(Correct) = 0.8 and P(Incorrect) = 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can form the following equation:

P(Correct) = P(M) * P(Correct | M) + P(F) * P(Incorrect | F)

where P(Correct | M) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker and P(Incorrect | F) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, P(Correct | M) = 0.8.
Given that the witness errs 20% of the time, P(Incorrect | F) = 0.2.

Now we can solve the equation for P(M):

P(M) = (P(Correct) - P(F) * P(Incorrect | F)) / P(Correct | M)

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(M) = (0.8 - 0.15 * 0.2) / 0.8 = 0.8571

The probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.8571 (85.71%).
