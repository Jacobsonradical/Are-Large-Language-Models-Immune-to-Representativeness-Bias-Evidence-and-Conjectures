Given the information provided, we can break down the problem into two parts: the probability that the witness made an error in their gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. Probability of witness error: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.

2. Gender distribution in the city: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Now, let's consider the scenario where the attacker is actually female. In this case, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as male 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of the attacker being female, given a witness error, is 0.85 (the percentage of females) times the probability of a witness error, which is 0.20.

So, the probability of the attacker being female given a witness error is 0.17 (0.85 * 0.20).

On the other hand, if the attacker is actually male, the witness would correctly identify the attacker's gender 80% of the time. Since 15% of the population is male, the probability of the attacker being male, given a correct identification, is 0.15 (the percentage of males) times the probability of a correct identification, which is 0.80.

So, the probability of the attacker being male given a correct identification is 0.12 (0.15 * 0.80).

Since we don't know whether the witness made an error or not, we have to consider both scenarios and their probabilities. The overall probability of the attacker being male is the sum of these two probabilities:

Probability of attacker being male = Probability of attacker being male given a correct identification * Probability of correct identification + Probability of attacker being male given a witness error * Probability of witness error

Probability of attacker being male = (0.12 * 0.80) + (0.17 * 0.20)

Probability of attacker being male = 0.096 + 0.034

Probability of attacker being male = 0.12 or 12%

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 12%.
