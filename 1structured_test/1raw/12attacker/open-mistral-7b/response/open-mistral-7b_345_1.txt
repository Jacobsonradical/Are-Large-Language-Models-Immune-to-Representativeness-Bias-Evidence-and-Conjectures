To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know the actual gender of the attacker, we can interpret the witness's errors as misidentifying a male as female and vice versa.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, there is a 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a female attacker as male.

On the other hand, there is a 0.15 probability of the attacker being male. If the witness correctly identifies a male attacker, the probability is 0.8. If the witness errs, there is a 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a male attacker as female.

So, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker is 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is the ratio of the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker to the total probability of the attacker being either male or female. That is, 0.83 / (0.83 + 0.17) = 0.822, or about 82.2%.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.822}
