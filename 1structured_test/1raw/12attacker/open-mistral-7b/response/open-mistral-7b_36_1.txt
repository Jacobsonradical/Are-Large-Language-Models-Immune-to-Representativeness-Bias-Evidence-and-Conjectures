To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the city has an 85% female population and a 15% male population, we can calculate the expected number of times the witness should correctly identify a male and the number of times they should incorrectly identify a male in a random sample.

Let's assume the witness makes a judgment call on 100 people. Since 85% of the population is female, we expect the witness to see 85 female individuals and 15 male individuals. Given the witness's 80% accuracy, we can expect them to correctly identify 15 male individuals (80% of 15) and incorrectly identify 5 female individuals as male (20% of 85).

However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male. Since they are wrong 20% of the time, we must subtract the expected number of incorrect identifications from the total number of individuals they saw. That leaves us with 95 correct identifications, which means they should have identified 85 females and 10 males correctly.

Since the attacker was not identified as female, we can conclude that the witness's mistake must have occurred when they identified a female individual as male. Therefore, the actual number of male individuals in the city that the witness correctly identified must be less than 10.

Given the information that the witness's gender identification is not perfectly reliable and that they have erred in this case, we cannot make a definitive estimate based solely on the city's gender distribution and the witness's accuracy. However, we can still make an educated guess based on the fact that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Since the witness's accuracy is 80%, and they have erred in this case, it's reasonable to assume that the actual probability of the attacker being male is slightly lower than 80%. Given that the attacker could have been one of the 10 male individuals the witness correctly identified in the hypothetical sample of 100 people, a conservative estimate would be around 10/95 = 0.105 or 10.5%.

Therefore, our estimate, based on the given information, is:
{probability: 0.105}
