Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population statistics and the witness's testimony.

1. From the population statistics, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. This means that the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

2. However, we also have the witness's testimony, which suggests that there's a possibility of misidentification. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we need to account for the possibility that this identification could be an error.

Given that the witness's error rate is 20%, if the attacker was actually female, the probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker as male is 0.20. This means that if the attacker was actually female, there would be a 20% chance that the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as male.

Since we cannot know for certain if the attacker is male or female, we should consider both possibilities and their associated probabilities. The probability of the attacker being male is 0.15, and the probability of the witness misidentifying a female as male is 0.20. The probability of both events happening (the attacker being female and the witness misidentifying her as male) is the product of these two probabilities: 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03.

However, since we are trying to estimate the probability of the attacker being male, we should also consider the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker and the probability of the attacker actually being male: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12.

Adding these two probabilities gives us the overall probability of the witness's testimony being accurate given the true gender of the attacker: 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15.

Therefore, given the witness's testimony and the population statistics, we estimate that the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15.
