To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the error rate is equally distributed between misidentifying males as females and misidentifying females as males, then the witness's true error rate for misidentifying males as females is 10% (0.20 / 2).

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of encountering a female person is 0.85. The probability of the witness misidentifying a male as a female in this case is 0.10.

So, the probability of a correct gender identification by the witness when encountering a male person is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 or 90%.

Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is equal to the probability of the witness making a correct identification when encountering a male person.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.90 or 90%.
