To estimate the probability of the attacker being male, we need to consider the witness's ability to identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's errors are more likely to be misidentifying males as females or females as males. Since the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male (as given in information b), let's assume for now that the errors are equally distributed between the two genders.

Given this assumption, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as follows:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8 (80%) if the gender is actually male.
2. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.15 * 0.2 (15% female population * 20% error rate), which is 0.03.
3. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 1 - 0.8 - 0.03 = 0.17.
4. Since the gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of a randomly selected person being male is 0.15.
5. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a randomly selected person as male is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
6. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a randomly selected person as male is 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.1465.
7. Therefore, the total probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male is 0.1465.
8. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.12 + 0.1465 = 0.2665.

However, we made an assumption about the error distribution that may not be accurate. Since we don't have enough information to adjust for this, the best estimate we can give is the 80% probability the witness reported, which is based on the witness's ability to judge gender under ideal conditions.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, based on the witness's report and the gender distribution in the city, is {probability: 0.8, please provide a number between 0 and 1}. But it should be noted that this estimate is likely to be an underestimate due to the uncertainty about the error distribution.
