Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, with an error rate of 20%.
2. The population ratio of males to females in the city is 15% to 85%.

We cannot directly use the population ratio (2) to estimate the attacker's gender, as the witness's ability to identify gender accurately is influenced by conditions, not the population ratio.

However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's report. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical framework for updating the probabilities of hypotheses as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's denote the hypothesis H1 as "the attacker is male" and H0 as "the attacker is female." The prior probability of H1 (P(H1)) is the ratio of males in the city (15%). The prior probability of H0 (P(H0)) is the ratio of females in the city (85%).

The likelihood of the witness reporting "male" given that the attacker is male (P(E|H1)) is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate). Similarly, the likelihood of the witness reporting "male" given that the attacker is female (P(E|H0)) is 0.15 (the witness's error rate).

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of H1 given the evidence E (P(H1|E)) is:

P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) * P(H1) / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H0) * P(H0)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H1|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.15) * (0.85)]

Calculating this, we find that P(H1|E) â‰ˆ 0.42 or 42%.

So, based on the witness's report and the witness's accuracy, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 42%.
