To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

We know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, in this case, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male. This means that if the attacker was actually female, there would be a 20% chance that the witness would still identify the attacker as male (a false positive).

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). We also know that 85% of the population is female, so P(female) = 0.85.

Given the witness's accuracy, we can calculate the probability that the witness would mistakenly identify a female as male as:

P(witness mistakes female as male) = 0.20

Since the witness made a mistake, the attacker must be female with a probability of P(witness mistakes female as male). So, the probability that the attacker is male is:

P(male) = 1 - P(witness mistakes female as male)

Substituting P(witness mistakes female as male) = 0.20 into the equation, we get:

P(male) = 1 - 0.20

P(male) = 0.80

So, based on the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.80 or 80%.
