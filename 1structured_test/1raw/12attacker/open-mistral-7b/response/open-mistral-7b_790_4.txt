To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male (before the witness's statement)
- P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female (before the witness's statement)
- P(w|M) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male
- P(w|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female
- P(M|w) as the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement

We are given that P(M) + P(F) = 1, and that P(w|M) = 0.8 and P(w|F) = 0.2. We also have the information that 85% of the population is female, which means P(F) = 0.85.

To find P(M|w), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(M|w) = [P(w|M) * P(M)] / [P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

P(M|w) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Computing this gives us:

P(M|w) â‰ˆ 0.1579 or 15.79%

So, based on the witness's statement and the demographics of the city, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 15.79%.
