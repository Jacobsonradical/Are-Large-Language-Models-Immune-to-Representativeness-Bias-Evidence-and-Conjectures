To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is female, the witness would incorrectly identify a female as male 20% * 0.85 = 0.17 (or 17%) of the time.

Given this, when the witness identifies someone as male, there is a 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%) chance that the person is indeed male.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.83, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
