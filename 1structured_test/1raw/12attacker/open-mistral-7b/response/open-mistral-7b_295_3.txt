To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. We know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male.
2. The witness's reliability is that they can correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.
3. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male. This means that if the attacker was indeed female, the witness would have incorrectly identified the gender 20% of the time.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

1. If the attacker is male, the witness will correctly identify the gender 80% of the time. So the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies the gender is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.
2. If the attacker is female, the witness will incorrectly identify the gender 20% of the time. So the probability that the attacker is female and the witness incorrectly identifies the gender is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the sum of these two probabilities should equal 100%. However, due to rounding errors, the actual sum might be slightly different.

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12 or 12%. This estimate takes into account both the population distribution and the witness's reliability in gender identification.
