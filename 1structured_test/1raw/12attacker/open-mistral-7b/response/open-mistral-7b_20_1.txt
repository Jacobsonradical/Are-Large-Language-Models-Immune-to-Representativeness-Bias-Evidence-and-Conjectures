Given the information provided, the witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying gender, with a 20% error rate. Since the attacker's gender is unknown, we cannot definitively say whether the witness's error occurred in this case or not.

However, we do know that the city has a 15% male population (from information b). If we assume that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed between genders, then the actual probability that the attacker is male might be lower than 15%.

To estimate the probability, we could use Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Witness's statement) = P(Witness's statement | Male) * P(Male) / (P(Witness's statement | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness's statement | Female) * P(Female))

But we don't have enough information to calculate P(Witness's statement | Female) as we don't know the error rate for identifying females. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise numerical estimate.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the witness's accuracy rate and the city's demographics. If the witness's error rate is indeed evenly distributed, then the probability of the attacker being male should be closer to 20% (the error rate) than 15% (the city's male population). But again, this is just an estimate and not a definitive answer.

{probability: Approximately between 0.20 and 0.15, but cannot provide a more precise number}
