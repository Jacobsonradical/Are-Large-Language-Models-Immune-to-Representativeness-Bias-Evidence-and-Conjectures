Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.

The probability that the attacker is actually male in the population is 15%. However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness might have mistakenly identified a female as male.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the actual probability of the attacker being male in the population (which we know is 0.15)
- P(F|M) as the probability that the witness mistakes a male for a female (this is given as 0.2)
- P(M|F identified as male) as the probability that the attacker is actually male given that the witness identified a person as male (we're trying to find this probability)

We know that P(M) = 0.15 and P(F|M) = 0.2. We also know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so P(M|M identified as male) = 1 and P(F|F identified as male) = 0.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find P(M|F identified as male):

P(M|F identified as male) = [P(F identified as male | M) * P(M)] / [P(F identified as male | M) * P(M) + P(F identified as male | F) * P(F)]

Substituting the given values:

P(M|F identified as male) = [(1-0.2) * 0.15] / [(1-0.2) * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Evaluating this expression yields:

P(M|F identified as male) = 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Simplifying this expression further, we get:

P(M|F identified as male) â‰ˆ 0.21

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.21, or 21%.
