To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, but the city has a gender distribution of 85% female and 15% male. This suggests that the witness might be biased towards identifying people as female, given the city's gender distribution.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as p, and the probability of the witness misidentifying a male as female as m. We know that the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 1 - m.

Since the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time, we can set up the equation:

0.8 = (1 - m) * 0.15

Solving for m, we get:

m ≈ 0.2

This means that the witness mistakes a male for female 20% of the time.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male is (1 - m) * P(attacker is male) = 0.8 * p.

The witness identified the attacker as male, so we know that 0.8 * p = 1. Solving for p, we get:

p ≈ 0.125

To summarize, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.125, or 12.5%. This estimate takes into account the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.
