Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender and a 20% error rate.
2. The population is 85% female and 15% male.

Assuming that the witness's accuracy is independent of the attacker's gender, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male based on the witness's statement and the population statistics.

The witness stated that the attacker is male. However, the witness's error rate is 20%, which means that in 20% of their cases, they identify a person as the opposite gender. So, there's a 20% chance that the witness made an error in this case and the attacker is actually female.

However, since the population is 85% female, it's more likely that the attacker is female if the witness made an error. Therefore, we can adjust the probability of the attacker being male to account for this.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness making an error given the population statistics. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of selecting a random person who is female is 0.85. If the attacker is actually female and the witness makes an error, they would incorrectly identify the attacker as male. So, the probability of the witness making an error and the attacker being female is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Given that the witness stated the attacker is male, the probability of the attacker being male is 1 - the probability of the witness making an error and the attacker being female = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.83 or 83%.
