To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male (the unknown we want to estimate)
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(witness|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(witness|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male

From the information provided, we know that:
- P(M) + P(F) = 1 (since the attacker must be either male or female)
- P(witness|M) = 0.8 (given in the information)
- P(witness|F) = 0.2 (given in the information)
- P(F) = 0.15 (given in the information) (note that P(M) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(M|witness):

P(M|witness) = P(witness|M) * P(M) / [P(witness|M) * P(M) + P(witness|F) * P(F)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(M|witness) = 0.8 * 0.85 / [0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15]

Calculating this gives us an estimate of 0.78 or 78% that the attacker is male.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.78}
