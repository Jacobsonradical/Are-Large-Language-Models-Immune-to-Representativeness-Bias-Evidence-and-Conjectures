To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is indeed male, and the witness correctly identified the gender.
2. The attacker is female, and the witness erroneously identified the gender.

The probability of scenario 1 is the proportion of males in the city, which is 0.15 (15%). The probability of scenario 2 is the proportion of females in the city, which is 0.85 (85%), times the probability that the witness errs, which is 0.2 (20%).

So, the probability of scenario 1 is 0.15, and the probability of scenario 2 is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Since we're interested in the probability that the attacker is male (scenario 1), we can calculate it as the probability of scenario 1 divided by the total probability of both scenarios:

probability = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.4651

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4651 or 46.51%.
