Given the information provided, there are two sources of probability to consider: the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. Population probability: The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. However, this does not directly give us the probability that the attacker is male, as we don't know if the attacker is from the city or not.

2. Witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. But the witness's error rate is not necessarily the same for male and female individuals. For example, if the witness is more likely to misidentify males as females, the actual probability of the attacker being male could be higher than 15%.

Unfortunately, the information given does not allow us to calculate a precise probability for the attacker being male. We would need more information, such as the witness's error rate for each gender or some indication that the attacker is likely to be from the city. Therefore, the best answer we can give is:

{probability: Unable to determine, please provide more information}
