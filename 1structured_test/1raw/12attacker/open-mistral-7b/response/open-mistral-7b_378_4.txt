To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they make errors 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Let's denote the actual probability that the attacker is male as P(male).

Given the witness's performance, when they encounter a male, they will correctly identify it as such 80% of the time. So, the probability that the witness identifies a male as male is 0.8 * P(male).

On the other hand, when the witness encounters a female, they will incorrectly identify her as male 20% of the time. Since there are more females in the city, the probability that they encounter a female is 0.85. So, the probability that the witness identifies a female as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The probability that the witness identifies a male as male or a female as male is the sum of the two probabilities above: 0.8 * P(male) + 0.17.

However, the witness identified the attacker as male. So, the actual probability that the attacker is male, P(male), must be greater than or equal to the probability that the witness identifies a male as male or a female as male. In mathematical terms:

P(male) ≥ 0.8 * P(male) + 0.17

This inequality simplifies to:

0.2 * P(male) ≥ 0.17

Now, we can solve for P(male):

P(male) ≥ 0.17 / 0.2
P(male) ≥ 0.85

Since the actual probability of the attacker being male must be between 0 and 1, the strictest estimate we can make based on the given information is:

{probability: 0.85, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
