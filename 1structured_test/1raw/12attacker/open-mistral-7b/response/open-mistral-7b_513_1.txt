To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the city has a 85% female population and a 15% male population, we can assume that the witness's errors in identifying gender are equally distributed between the two genders.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). The probability that the witness errs and identifies the attacker as female is P(male) * 0.2 (error probability for males).

The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male is P(male) * 0.8 (correct probability for males).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can set up an equation: P(male) * 0.8 = 1 - P(male) * 0.2

Solving this equation, we get: P(male) â‰ˆ 0.667 (approximately 66.7%)

So, our estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.667.
