Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying gender is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. However, the witness made an error in identifying the attacker as male. This means that even though 85% of the population in the city is female, the witness's incorrect identification suggests that the attacker might be in the 15% male population.

So, the probability that the attacker is male, based on the witness's error, would be the proportion of the population that is male. In this case, that would be 15%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.15}
