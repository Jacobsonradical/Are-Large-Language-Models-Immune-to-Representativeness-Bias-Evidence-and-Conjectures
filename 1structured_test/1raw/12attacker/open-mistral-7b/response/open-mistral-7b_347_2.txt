Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break down the problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female and 15% is male.
2. However, a witness who is relatively accurate in identifying gender (80% correct, 20% incorrect) has identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a method for updating the probabilities of hypotheses given evidence. In this case, the hypotheses are "the attacker is male" and "the attacker is female," and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is defined as: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Here, P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification, P(B|A) is the probability that the witness would identify a male as male, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (85%), and P(B) is the probability of the witness's identification (which we can't directly calculate but we can rearrange the equation to find).

Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

So, P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / P(B)

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2. Because the witness is equally likely to be wrong about males and females, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Substituting this into the equation for P(A|B), we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.524

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.524 or 52.4%.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.524}
