To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as p. The witness incorrectly identifies the gender 20% of the time, so the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male is 0.2. Since 85% of the population is female, this means that the probability that the witness sees a female and incorrectly identifies her as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Similarly, the probability that the witness sees a male and incorrectly identifies him as female is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Since the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, the probability that the witness sees a male and correctly identifies him as male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the sum of the probabilities that the witness correctly identified a male and the probabilities that the witness incorrectly identified a female as male:

p = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%.
