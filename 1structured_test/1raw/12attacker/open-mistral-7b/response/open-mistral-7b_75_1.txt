To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker as male. Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, there's a 20% chance that the attacker is actually female but was misidentified as male.

Given this information, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies gender, and the probability that the witness mistakes a female for a male and incorrectly identifies the attacker as male.

Let P(male) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(female) be the probability that the attacker is female. We know that P(male) + P(female) = 1.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker is P(male), while the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male is P(female) * 0.2 (the 20% error rate).

So, the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is P(male) + P(female) * 0.2.

We are given that the witness identified the attacker as male, so we can set this total probability equal to 1:

P(male) + P(female) * 0.2 = 1

We know that P(male) + P(female) = 1, so we can rewrite the equation as:

P(male) = 1 - P(female) * 0.2

Now, we need to find a value for P(female) using the given information about the population distribution. We know that 85% of the population is female, so P(female) = 0.85.

Substitute P(female) into the equation:

P(male) = 1 - (0.85) * 0.2

Calculate the probability:

P(male) = 1 - 0.17

P(male) = 0.83 (probability estimate)

Therefore, based on the population distribution and the witness's accuracy, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.83 or 83%.
