Given the two pieces of information provided, let's break it down:

1. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender, identified the attacker as male.

Since we don't have any additional information about the accuracy of the witness's identification in this specific case, we'll assume that the witness's accuracy remains at 80%. However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness might have made an error, considering they are incorrect 20% of the time.

The probability of the witness making a correct identification (male attacker) is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness making an error (female attacker) is 0.2 (20%).

Given that the city's population is 85% female, the probability of a random attack being committed by a female is 0.85.

Now, since the witness identified the attacker as male, and they might have made an error, we need to consider both possibilities:

1. The witness correctly identified a male attacker: The probability of this happening is 0.8 (witness's accuracy) * 0.15 (male population proportion) = 0.12 (12%).
2. The witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male: The probability of this happening is 0.2 (witness's error rate) * 0.85 (female population proportion) = 0.17 (17%).

However, since we are looking for the probability that the attacker is male, we only need to consider the first scenario. So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 (12%).

In summary:
{probability: 0.12}
