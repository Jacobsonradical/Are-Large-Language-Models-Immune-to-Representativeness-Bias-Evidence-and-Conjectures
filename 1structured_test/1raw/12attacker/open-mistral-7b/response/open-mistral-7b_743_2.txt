Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in determining gender, identified the attacker as male.

However, it's important to note that the witness's identification does not necessarily reflect the true gender distribution of the attacker. The witness might have mistakenly identified a female as male due to poor lighting or other factors.

Given that the witness's accuracy is 80%, we can calculate the probability of the witness making an error in identifying the gender of the attacker as 20%. But since we don't know if the witness made an error or not, we can't directly use this information to estimate the probability of the attacker being male.

Therefore, based on the information given, it's not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. The information about the city's gender distribution is not directly related to the witness's identification, and we don't have enough information about the witness's error rate in this specific situation.
