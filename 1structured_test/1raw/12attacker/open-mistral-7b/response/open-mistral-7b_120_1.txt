Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness has an accuracy of 80% in identifying gender, and an error rate of 20%.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory, and it allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, our event is the attacker being male, and our evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male
- P(W|F) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male (an error)

From the problem statement, we have:
- P(M) + P(F) = 1 (since the attacker must be either male or female)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies females as males 20% of the time)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(M|W):

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|W) = [0.8 * P(M)] / [0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * (1 - P(M))]

Since we don't have a direct value for P(M), we cannot provide a numerical estimate. However, we can solve the equation for P(M) and express the probability as a function of P(M).

To get a numerical estimate, we would need additional information or make an assumption about the value of P(M). Without this, I'm unable to provide a specific probability.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: Unable to provide a number, see explanation}
