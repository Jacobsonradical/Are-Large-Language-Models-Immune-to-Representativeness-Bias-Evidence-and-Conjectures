The given information suggests that the majority of the population in the city is female, but we also have a witness who claimed to have identified the attacker as male and was correct in doing so 80% of the time. However, we also know that the witness made errors 20% of the time.

Given this information, we cannot directly apply the witness's accuracy rate to the population statistics because the witness's ability to correctly identify gender might not be representative of the population as a whole. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male, taking into account both the population statistics and the witness's accuracy.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is proportional to the probability of B given A times the prior probability of A. In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(W|M) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker. Similarly, let P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female, and P(W|F) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male.

We are given that P(M) = 0.15, P(W|M) = 0.8, and P(W|F) = 0.2. We want to find P(M|W).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Performing the calculations, we find:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.24

This means that, given the witness's statement and their accuracy rate, we estimate that there is a 24% probability that the attacker is male. However, as mentioned earlier, this estimate may not accurately reflect the true probability in the population due to potential biases in the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.
