Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness would identify someone as male given that they are actually male)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that the attacker is male before considering the witness's testimony)
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (the probability that the witness identified someone as male)

The witness's ability to judge gender is given in the first piece of information: they correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases. This means that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(not B|A) = 0.2.

The second piece of information tells us that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This means that P(A) = 0.15 and P(not A) = 0.85.

However, we don't have enough information to calculate the prior probability of the witness identifying someone as male, P(B). This is because we don't know the population of the city or how often the witness encounters males and females.

Without this information, we cannot calculate a precise probability. However, we can make an approximate calculation. Since the witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time, and they are more likely to encounter females (85% of the population), we might expect them to identify more people as female than male. So, our estimate is that the probability that the attacker is male is less than 0.15, but we cannot give a precise number.

So, the answer is: {probability: less than 0.15, but we cannot give a precise number}
