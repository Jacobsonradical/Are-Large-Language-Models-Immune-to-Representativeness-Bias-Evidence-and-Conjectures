Given the information provided, we have two sources of probability: the city's gender distribution and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

1. The city's gender distribution suggests that the attacker is female with a probability of 0.85.
2. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender indicates that they are likely to misidentify a female as male 20% of the time.
3. However, we don't have information about the witness's error rate for identifying males as males. Without this information, we cannot directly apply the witness's error rate to the attacker's gender.

Since we don't have sufficient information to compute a precise probability, the best answer I can provide is that the probability of the attacker being male is uncertain and cannot be estimated accurately based on the given information.

{probability: uncertain, cannot be estimated accurately}
