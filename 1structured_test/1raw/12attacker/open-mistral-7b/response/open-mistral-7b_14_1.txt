Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is proportional to the probability of event B given A times the prior probability of A.

In this case, event A is the attacker being male, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as male. Let P(A) be the prior probability of the attacker being male (which we don't know yet), and P(B|A) be the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (given in the first piece of information as 0.8).

The probability of the witness making a mistake and identifying a female as male is P(B|not A) = 0.2 (given in the first piece of information).

The population statistics give us the prior probability of a person being female, P(not A) = 0.85 (given in the second piece of information).

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find P(A):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * P(A)) / [(0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

To find the estimate for P(A|B), we need to solve for P(A). However, without additional information, we cannot provide a specific value for P(A). Instead, we can rearrange the equation to express P(A|B) in terms of P(A):

P(A|B) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2 * 0.85]

This equation gives us the probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male. However, without a specific value for P(A), we cannot provide a numerical estimate for P(A|B).
