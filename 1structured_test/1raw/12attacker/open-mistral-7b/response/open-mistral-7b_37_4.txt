To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's error rate.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being male as P(male).

We know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, so P(male) + P(female) = 1 * 0.15 = 0.15.

The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually male, and the witness correctly identified him. The probability of this scenario is P(male) * 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time).
2. The attacker is actually female, and the witness errs and incorrectly identifies him as male. The probability of this scenario is P(female) * 0.2 (since the witness errs in identifying females 20% of the time).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male is the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios:

P(male) * 0.8 + P(female) * 0.2

We know that P(male) + P(female) = 0.15, so we can rewrite the equation as:

(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.15 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15. This means that, given the information available, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is male.
