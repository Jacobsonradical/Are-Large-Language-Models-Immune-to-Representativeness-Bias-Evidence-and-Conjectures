To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

The probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis H (P(E|H)) is given by the witness's ability to correctly identify gender, which is 0.8 or 80%. The probability of the evidence E given the hypothesis not-H (P(E|not-H)) is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2 or 20%.

The prior probability of the hypothesis H (P(H)) is unknown, but we are given information about the gender distribution in the city. Since 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can assume that P(H) = 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being male) and P(not-H) = 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being female).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not-H) * P(not-H))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating the probability, we find:

P(H|E) = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 12%.
