Given the information provided, the witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, and there is a 15% male population in the city. However, we don't have direct information about how this specific witness's performance might be affected by the gender imbalance in the population. Since we can't make an adjustment for this, we'll use the raw probability of the witness being correct when identifying a male attacker.

{probability: 0.8}

This estimate is based on the witness's accuracy rate of 80%. It assumes that the witness's ability to judge gender is independent of the gender distribution in the city. However, it's important to note that this is a simplification, and in real-world scenarios, other factors could influence the probability of the attacker's gender.
