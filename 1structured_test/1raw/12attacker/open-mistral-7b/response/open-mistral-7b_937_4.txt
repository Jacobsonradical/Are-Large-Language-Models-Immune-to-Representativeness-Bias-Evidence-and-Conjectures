Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is: P(hypothesis | evidence) = P(evidence | hypothesis) * P(hypothesis) / P(evidence)

Let's break this down:

1. P(attacker is male) is what we want to find. This is the prior probability, or the probability of the attacker being male before the witness's testimony.

2. P(witness identifies attacker as male | attacker is male) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender. This is given as 0.8 in the problem.

3. P(witness identifies attacker as male | attacker is female) is the likelihood of the witness mistakenly identifying the attacker's gender. Given that there are equal numbers of males and females, and the witness is wrong 20% of the time, this is 0.2.

4. P(witness identifies attacker as male) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender. This can be found using Bayes' theorem with the prior probability being the proportion of males in the city. Given that 15% of the population is male, P(witness identifies attacker as male) = 0.15 * P(attacker is male) + 0.85 * P(attacker is female) = 0.15 * P(attacker is male) + 0.85 * (1 - P(attacker is male))

5. We can rearrange this to solve for P(attacker is male): P(attacker is male) = [P(witness identifies attacker as male) - 0.85 * (1 - P(attacker is male))] / 0.15

Now, we can plug in the values we know: P(witness identifies attacker as male) = 0.8, and the proportion of males in the city is 0.15.

So, P(attacker is male) = [0.8 - 0.85 * (1 - 0.15)] / 0.15 = 0.46 / 0.15 = 0.3067

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.3067 or 30.67% (rounded to two decimal places).
