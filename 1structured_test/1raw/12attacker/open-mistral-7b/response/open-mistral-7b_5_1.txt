The given information suggests that in the general population, 15% of the people are male. However, the witness's reliability in identifying gender is different from the population distribution. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, meaning they incorrectly identify the gender 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there is a 80% chance that the witness was correct and the attacker is indeed male. On the other hand, there is a 20% chance that the witness was incorrect and the attacker is actually female.

However, since the victim could not see the attacker's gender, we cannot directly apply the witness's error rate to the victim's situation. The witness's error rate is based on the assumption that they have a 50-50 chance of encountering a male or female, which is not the case in the city where 85% of the population is female.

Therefore, while we cannot provide a strict probability based on the given information, it would be reasonable to consider that the attacker is more likely to be female (given the city's population distribution) than the witness's identification suggests. However, the witness's reliability in gender identification is also a significant factor. Without more specific information, it is challenging to provide a definitive probability estimate.

{probability: Unable to provide a specific number, but it seems reasonable to consider that the attacker is more likely to be female than the witness's identification suggests}
