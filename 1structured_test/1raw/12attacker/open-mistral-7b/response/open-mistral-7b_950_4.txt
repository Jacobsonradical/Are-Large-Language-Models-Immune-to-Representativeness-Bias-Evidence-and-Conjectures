To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- M: the attacker is male
- F: the attacker is female
- E: the witness identifies the attacker as male

The prior probability of the attacker being male, P(M), can be estimated from the city's population statistics provided in part b: P(M) = 0.15 (15%).

The probability of the witness identifying a male attacker correctly, P(E|M), is given in part a: P(E|M) = 0.8.

The probability of the witness identifying a female attacker as male, P(E|F), is given in part a as well: P(E|F) = 0.2 / 0.5 = 0.4 (the witness errs 20% of the time).

The probability of a female attacker, P(F), can be found using the total probability formula: P(F) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male, P(M|E), using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|E) = P(E|M) * P(M) / [P(E|M) * P(M) + P(E|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.4 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(M|E) â‰ˆ 0.139 (13.9%)

So, given the witness's identification and considering the city's population statistics, there is approximately a 13.9% chance that the attacker is male.
