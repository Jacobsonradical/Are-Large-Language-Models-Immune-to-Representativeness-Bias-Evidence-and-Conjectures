To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

The witness's error rate (20%) includes both false positives (misidentifying a female as male) and false negatives (misidentifying a male as female). Since we don't know which type of error occurred in this case, the appropriate approach is to use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is proportional to the probability of B given A multiplied by the prior probability of A. In this case, A is the attacker being male, and B is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

The probability of event A (attacker is male) is 15%, and the probability of event B (witness identifies attacker as male) can be calculated as:

P(B|A) = Witness's accuracy rate = 0.8

The probability of event B given not A (attacker is female) can be calculated as:

P(B|not A) = Witness's error rate = 0.2

The probability of not A (attacker is female) is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the numbers:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85))

Calculating precisely, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.185

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is about 18.5%.
