To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the original population distribution and the witness's error rate.

1. The population is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness misidentifies gender 20% of the time.

However, we also know that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male. This means that the witness did not make an error in this specific case.

In the general population, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is male. But since the witness did not make an error, this means that the attacker's gender was correctly identified in this case. So, the probability that the attacker is male is equal to the true probability of an attacker being male, which is 15%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is: {probability: 0.15}
