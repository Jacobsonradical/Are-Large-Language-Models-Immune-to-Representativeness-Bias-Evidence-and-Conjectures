To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the witness's reliability.

Let's denote:
P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male

From the first piece of information, we know that 85% of the population is female, so P(F) = 0.85. This means that P(M) = 1 - P(F) = 0.15.

However, the witness's statement introduces a source of error. If the witness's gender judgment is unbiased, we would expect P(witness says M|M) = P(M) and P(witness says F|F) = P(F). But the witness's error rate suggests that this is not the case.

Let's denote:
P(witness says M|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male
P(witness says F|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as female
P(witness says F|F) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as female
P(witness says M|F) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male

From the second piece of information, we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so:

P(witness says M|M) + P(witness says F|F) = 0.8

Also, we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so:

P(witness says F|M) + P(witness says M|F) = 0.2

Since the witness is supposed to be unbiased, we can assume that:

P(witness says M|M) = P(M)
P(witness says F|F) = P(F)

So, we have two equations with four unknowns. We can simplify these equations by noticing that:

P(M) = 1 - P(F)
P(witness says F|M) = 1 - P(witness says M|M)
P(witness says M|F) = 1 - P(witness says F|F)

Now we have:

P(witness says M|M) + P(witness says F|F) = 0.8
1 - P(witness says M|M) + 1 - P(witness says F|F) = 0.2

Since P(witness says M|M) = 0.15 and P(witness says F|F) = 0.85, we can find that:

1 - 0.15 + 1 - 0.85 = 0.2

This is a contradiction, which means that the witness's ability to judge a person's gender under the given conditions cannot be reconciled with the given population statistics. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male based on the given information.
