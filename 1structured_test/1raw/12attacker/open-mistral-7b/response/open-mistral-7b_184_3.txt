Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The population distribution: 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender: 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

The witness's statement that the attacker was male is not enough to definitively conclude that the attacker was indeed male, as the witness's accuracy is only 80%. However, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the population distribution.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B can be calculated as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, B is the witness's statement that the attacker is male, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (85%), P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male as male (80%), and P(B) is the probability of the witness making the statement "the attacker is male" (which is a combination of the probability of the attacker being male and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male, and the probability of the attacker being female and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male (20%).

So, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.68

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.85) / 0.68 â‰ˆ 0.74

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 74%.
