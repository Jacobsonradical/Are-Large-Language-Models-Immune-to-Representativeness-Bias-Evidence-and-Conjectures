To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being female as p and the probability of the attacker being male as 1-p.

The witness incorrectly identifies genders 20% of the time, which means that when the actual gender is different from what the witness identifies, there is a 20% chance that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male and a 20% chance that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female.

Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we can say that when the actual gender is the same as what the witness identifies, the witness is correct 80% of the time, which means that when the witness identifies a person as female, the probability that the person is indeed female is 0.8, and when the witness identifies a person as male, the probability that the person is indeed male is 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is 0.8 (the probability that the witness is correct when identifying a male).

Now, let's consider the gender distribution in the city. Since 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can say that the probability of an attacker being female is 0.85, and the probability of an attacker being male is 0.15.

Since the witness's ability to judge gender is independent of the gender distribution in the city, we can use the probability that the witness is correct when identifying a male (0.8) as our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.8.
