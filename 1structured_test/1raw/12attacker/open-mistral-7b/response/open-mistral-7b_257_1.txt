To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they err 20% of the time.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male). The probability of the witness identifying a male as male is P(male) * 0.8, and the probability of the witness identifying a male as female is P(male) * 0.2.

Since the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, we have P(male) * 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness's error rate). Solving this equation gives us P(male) = 0.25 (or 25%).

However, the witness's error rate is based on a 50-50 gender split, while in the city, the gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male. To account for this, we need to adjust the witness's error rate.

Let E be the error rate when the gender distribution is not 50-50. Then, the witness's error rate when the gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male is:

E = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.10667

The adjusted probability of the attacker being male is:

P(male) = 0.15 / (0.15 / E + 1) = 0.15 / (0.15 / 0.10667 + 1) = 0.127

In summary, given the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 12.7% (or 12.7%).
