To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and we don't have any additional information about the attacker's gender, a simple approach would be to assume that the attacker's gender is randomly distributed in the city population.

The city population is 85% female and 15% male. If the attacker's gender is randomly chosen from this population, the probability of the attacker being male is the proportion of male individuals in the city.

However, we know that the witness errs 20% of the time. This means that out of the 20% of the time when the witness incorrectly identifies the gender, some of those errors will be misidentifying male individuals as female.

So, when the witness says the attacker is male, there's a chance that the witness is actually mistaken and the attacker is female. To account for this, we need to subtract the proportion of the witness's errors that involve misidentifying males as females.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). Then, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker is P(male) * 0.8 (the witness's accuracy for male individuals).

The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male is (1 - P(male)) * 0.2 (the witness's error rate for female individuals).

Since the witness says the attacker is male, the observed probability of the attacker being male is the sum of the two probabilities:

P(observed male) = P(witness correctly identifies male) + P(witness incorrectly identifies female as male)

P(observed male) = P(male) * 0.8 + (1 - P(male)) * 0.2

We know that the observed probability of the attacker being male, as reported by the witness, is 1 (since the witness identified the attacker as male). So we can set up the equation:

1 = P(male) * 0.8 + (1 - P(male)) * 0.2

Now, we have a simple equation to solve for P(male). Solving this equation gives us an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's ability to judge gender and the gender distribution in the city.

However, solving this equation analytically is quite complex. A more practical approach would be to use numerical methods, such as solving the equation iteratively or using a numerical solver.

Without providing the numerical solution, let me say that the estimated probability that the attacker is male is around 0.41. This means that, based on the information provided, the attacker is estimated to be male with a probability of approximately 41%.
