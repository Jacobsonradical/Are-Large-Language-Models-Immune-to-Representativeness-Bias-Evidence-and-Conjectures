Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they make an error 20% of the time. If the attacker's gender is actually male, the witness will correctly identify it 80% of the time. If the attacker's gender is female, the witness will mistakenly identify it as male 20% of the time (since they make errors 20% of the time).

Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker, which is 0.8 (or 80%) times the probability that the attacker is male, and 0.2 (or 20%) times the probability that the attacker is female.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.
