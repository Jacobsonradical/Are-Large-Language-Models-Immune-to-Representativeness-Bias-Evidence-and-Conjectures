Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male based on the witness's accuracy and the city's gender distribution.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy: the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that in a fair situation, where the attacker's gender is actually 50% male and 50% female, the witness would incorrectly identify the gender as male 20% of the time.

However, we know that in the city, 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. This means that in a random encounter, the chance of encountering a male is 15%.

So, when the witness says that the attacker is male, there are two possible explanations:

1. The witness is correct, and the attacker is actually male.
2. The witness is incorrect, but the attacker just happens to be one of the 15% of males in the city.

The probability of the first event is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8. The probability of the second event is the city's gender distribution, which is 0.15.

Since these are two mutually exclusive events, we can find the probability of the attacker being male by adding their probabilities:

{probability: 0.8 + 0.15 = 0.95}

The estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.95 or 95%. This is a high probability, but it's important to remember that it's based on the witness's testimony and the city's gender distribution, which may not be perfectly accurate. It's always possible that the attacker's gender was misidentified or that the city's gender distribution is not representative of the area where the attack occurred.
