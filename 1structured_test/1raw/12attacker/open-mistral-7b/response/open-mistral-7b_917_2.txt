To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errors 20% of the time. However, the witness's error rate is not specified to be systematically biased towards either gender. Therefore, we can assume that the witness's errors are random and occur equally for males and females.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of a random person being female is 0.85. Since the witness's errors are random, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is also 0.20.

Similarly, the probability of a random person being male is 0.15, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is also 0.20.

To account for the witness's correct gender identifications, we need to subtract the probabilities of the witness's errors from the actual gender probabilities.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a female as female is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.
The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is equal to the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 * 0.80 + 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.12 + 0.004 = 0.124, or 12.4%.
