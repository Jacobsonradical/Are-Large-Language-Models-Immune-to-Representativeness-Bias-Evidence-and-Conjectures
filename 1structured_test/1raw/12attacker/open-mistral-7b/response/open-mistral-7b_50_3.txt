To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, which means they correctly identify gender 80% of the time. Given that the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying a male as follows:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8 (their accuracy rate).
2. The probability of a person being male is 0.15 (the city's male population proportion).
3. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male and the person being male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (the likelihood of both events occurring).

However, the witness also incorrectly identifies males as females 20% of the time. The probability of this happening is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03.

Since we don't know whether the witness identified the attacker as male or female, we need to consider both scenarios:

1. The witness identified the attacker as male (probability 0.12).
2. The witness identified the attacker as female, but the attacker is actually male (probability 0.03).

So, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 or 15%.
