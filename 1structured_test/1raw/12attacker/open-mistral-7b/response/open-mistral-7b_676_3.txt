To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the population.

From the information given, we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness made an error in this specific case, identifying the attacker as male. This means that the actual gender of the attacker is either male (a correct identification by the witness) or female (an error by the witness).

Since the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, it's more likely that the attacker is female due to the higher population ratio. However, since the witness erred, it's also possible that the attacker is male.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(wM) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(wF) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male

We are given the following information:
1. P(M) + P(F) = 1
2. P(wM) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
3. P(wF) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female 20% of the time)

We are also given that the witness identified the attacker as male, so:
4. wM = P(M) * 1 + P(F) * 0

From this last equation, we can solve for P(F):
5. P(F) = (1 - P(wM)) / 0.15

Now we can substitute this into the first equation to find P(M):
6. P(M) = 1 - P(F)
7. P(M) = 1 - [(1 - P(wM)) / 0.15]

Substituting P(wM) = 0.8:
8. P(M) = 1 - [(1 - 0.8) / 0.15]
9. P(M) â‰ˆ 0.387

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.387 or 38.7%.
