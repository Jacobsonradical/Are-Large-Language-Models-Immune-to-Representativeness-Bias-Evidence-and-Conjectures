To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's gender identification accuracy and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Given these facts, let's calculate the probability:

1. If the attacker is female, the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as male 20% of the time.
2. If the attacker is male, the witness will correctly identify the attacker 80% of the time.
3. Since the city's population is 85% female, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85.
4. The probability that the attacker is male is then 1 - 0.85 = 0.15, or 15%.

However, we should account for the witness's error rate when considering the witness's testimony. If the witness identifies the attacker as male, the actual probability that the attacker is male is higher than 0.15 due to the witness's error rate.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male:

1. The witness correctly identifies the attacker as male 80% of the time.
2. Since the city's population is 15% male, the probability that the attacker is male when the witness identifies the attacker as male is 0.15.
3. The probability that the witness errs and identifies a female attacker as male is 0.20.
4. Since the city's population is 85% female, the probability that the witness errs and identifies a female attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17.
5. Therefore, the probability that the witness identifies a male attacker as male is 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32, or 32%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can now estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed male:

1. Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male divided by the sum of the probabilities that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male and erroneously identified a female attacker as male: P(attacker is male | witness says 'male') = 0.32 / (0.32 + 0.17) = 0.65, or 65%.

Answer: {probability: 0.65}
