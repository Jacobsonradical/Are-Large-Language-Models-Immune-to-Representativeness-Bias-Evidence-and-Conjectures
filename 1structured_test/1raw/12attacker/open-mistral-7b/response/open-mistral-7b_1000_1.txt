To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's gender identification accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The gender distribution in the city: The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Given that the witness is not infallible, there is a chance that they made an error in identifying the attacker as male. Let's break down the probabilities:

- If the attacker is male, the probability that the witness correctly identifies him as such is 0.8 (80%).
- If the attacker is female, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies her as male is 0.2 (20%).

Since the witness stated that the attacker was male, there are two scenarios that could have occurred:

1. The attacker is actually male, and the witness correctly identified him.
2. The attacker is female, and the witness made an error.

We can calculate the probability of each scenario:

1. The probability of the attacker being male and the witness correctly identifying him is 0.15 (15%) * 0.8 (80%) = 0.12 (12%).
2. The probability of the attacker being female and the witness incorrectly identifying her is 0.85 (85%) * 0.2 (20%) = 0.17 (17%).

Since we're interested in the probability that the attacker is male, we need to find the total probability of both scenarios that lead to the observation of a male attacker:

Total probability = Probability of scenario 1 + Probability of scenario 2
                        = 0.12 (12%) + 0.17 (17%)
                        = 0.29 (29%)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the city's gender distribution, is approximately 29%.
