Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a principle of conditional probability used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's denote:
- H0: The attacker is male
- H1: The attacker is female
- E: The witness's identification of a male attacker

The prior probability P(H0) is the probability that the attacker is male in the population. We don't have this information directly, but we can infer it from the information given.

Given that 85% of the population is female, it means that 15% is male. So, the prior probability P(H0) = 0.15 (or 15%).

The likelihood P(E|H0) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, given that the attacker is indeed male. According to the information, the witness does this 80% of the time.

Similarly, the likelihood P(E|H1) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, given that the attacker is female. This happens 20% of the time.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H0|E) = P(E|H0) * P(H0) / (P(E|H0) * P(H0) + P(E|H1) * P(H1))

Plugging in the values:

P(H0|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85))

Calculating the probability:

P(H0|E) â‰ˆ 0.2857

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 28.57%.
