To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's gender identification, and our prior belief is the population distribution of males and females in the city.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is male,
- B as the event that the witness identifies a person as male,
- P(A) as the prior probability of A,
- P(B|A) as the probability of B given A,
- P(B|not A) as the probability of B given not A,
- P(not A) as the prior probability of not A.

We are given:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy)
2. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (from the witness's accuracy)
3. P(A) = probability of attacker being male
4. P(not A) = probability of attacker being female = 1 - P(A)
5. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since we are only interested in P(A), we can rewrite Bayes' theorem as:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

We can compute P(B) using the given probabilities:

P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))

Now we can find P(A | B):

P(A | B) = (0.8 * P(A)) / ((0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(A))))

Since we don't have a value for P(A), we cannot provide a specific number. However, we can express P(A | B) as a function of P(A). To find an estimate of P(A | B), we can use the second piece of information given in the problem: the population ratio of males and females in the city is 15% and 85%, respectively.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate for P(A) would be 0.15 (15%). Plugging this value into the equation for P(A | B), we get:

P(A | B) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

P(A | B) ≈ 0.12

So, based on the information given, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
