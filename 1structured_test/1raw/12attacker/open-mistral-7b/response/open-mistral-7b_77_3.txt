The probability estimate of the attacker being male, given the information provided, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is the attacker being male, and the evidence is the witness's identification and the city's gender distribution.

Let's denote:

- A: Attacker is male
- E1: Witness identifies attacker as male
- E2: City's gender distribution (85% female, 15% male)

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E1, E2) = [P(E1|A) * P(A)] / [P(E1|A) * P(A) + P(E1|not A) * P(not A)]

Where:
- P(A) = Probability of attacker being male in the population
- P(not A) = Probability of attacker being female in the population
- P(E1|A) = Probability of witness correctly identifying a male attacker
- P(E1|not A) = Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male

From the information given, we know that P(E1|A) = 0.8 and P(E1|not A) = 0.2. We can compute P(A) and P(not A) from P(E1|A) and P(E1|not A), using the law of total probability: P(A) + P(not A) = 1

P(A) = P(E1|A) * P(A) / [P(E1|A) * P(A) + P(E1|not A) * P(not A)]

Since the city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male, we have P(not A) = 0.15. Now we can find P(A):

P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.22 = 0.545

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.545 or 54.5%.
