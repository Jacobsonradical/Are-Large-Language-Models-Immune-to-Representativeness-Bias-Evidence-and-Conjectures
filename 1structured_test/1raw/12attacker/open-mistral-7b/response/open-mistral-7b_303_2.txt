Given the information provided, we have two sources of data: the city's population statistics and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. The city's population statistics indicate that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. However, this does not directly apply to the attacker's gender since the witness's identification is what we are interested in.

2. The witness's reliability is that they correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can consider this as a successful identification by the witness. However, we do not know if this identification was correct or not, given that the victim could not see the attacker's gender.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we should consider both the city's population statistics and the witness's reliability. Since we do not know if the witness's identification was correct, we can't directly use their success rate. Instead, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake given their success rate.

Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of them being incorrect is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 20%.

However, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is actually male, not the probability of the witness's mistake. Since we don't have any other information, we can only consider the city's population statistics. Given that 85% of the city's population is female, the probability that the attacker is male is 15%.

Therefore, based solely on the city's population statistics, we would estimate that the attacker is male with a probability of:
