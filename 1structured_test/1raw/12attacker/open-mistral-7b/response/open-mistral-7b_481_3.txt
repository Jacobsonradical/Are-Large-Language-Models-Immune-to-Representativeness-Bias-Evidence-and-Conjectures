This is a probability problem that involves Bayes' theorem. Let's break it down:

1. We start with the prior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being male in the population, given by the information in part A. Since 15% of the population is male, the prior probability is 0.15.

2. The likelihood is the probability of the event "witness identifies attacker as male" given that the attacker is actually male or female. From part B, we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness errs more often by identifying males as females (20%) than by identifying females as males (10%), the likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is higher than the likelihood of identifying a female as male. Therefore, the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male is 0.8, and the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female is 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02.

3. Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement.

    P(Male | Statement) = P(Statement | Male) \* P(Male) / (P(Statement | Male) \* P(Male) + P(Statement | Female) \* P(Female))

    Plugging in the values, we get:

    P(Male | Statement) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.1 \* 0.85)

    After calculating, we find that the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement is approximately 0.64 (or 64%).

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.64}.
