The given information consists of two parts: the gender distribution in the city and the accuracy of the witness in identifying gender.

1. According to the first piece of information, 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. The second piece of information states that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness misidentified the attacker as male.

Since we cannot rely on the witness's identification due to the night conditions, we should use the overall population gender distribution instead. So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the city's population distribution, is 15%.

However, the question asks for an estimate considering the witness's accuracy in identifying gender, but we cannot use this information since we cannot determine whether the witness's mistake was a false positive (identifying a female as male) or a false negative (identifying a male as female).

Given the available information, the best estimate is based on the population distribution, and the probability that the attacker is male is 15%.
