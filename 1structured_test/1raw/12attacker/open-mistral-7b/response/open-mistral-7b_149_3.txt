Given the information provided, let's reason through this problem:

1. We have a witness who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.

However, the witness's mistaken gender identification could have been either misidentifying a male as female or a female as male. Without knowing the specific error rate for each gender, we cannot determine if the witness's mistake was more likely to be misidentifying a male as female or a female as male.

Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

{probability: undefined, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
