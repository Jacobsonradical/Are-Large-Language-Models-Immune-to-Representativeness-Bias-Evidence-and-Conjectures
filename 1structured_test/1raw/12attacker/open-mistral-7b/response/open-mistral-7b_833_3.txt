Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. However, we also have a witness who, under similar conditions, correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

Let's denote:
P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female (since we know the attacker's gender is not female, we are looking for P(M) = 1 - P(F))
P(correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person's gender
P(male|correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male person
P(male|incorrect) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female person as male

We are given that P(correct) = 0.8 and P(male|correct) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male). We don't have enough information to directly compute P(male|incorrect), but we can express it in terms of P(F) and P(male|correct):

P(male|incorrect) = 1 - P(F) * P(male|correct)

We know that P(correct) * P(male|correct) + P(correct) * P(male|incorrect) + P(incorrect) * P(male|correct) + P(incorrect) * P(male|incorrect) = 1 (total probability).

Substituting the given values, we have:

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * P(male|incorrect) + 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.2 * P(male|incorrect) = 1

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.12 + 0.8 * P(male|incorrect) + 0.03 + 0.2 * P(male|incorrect) = 1

0.8 * P(male|incorrect) + 0.25 = 0.87

P(male|incorrect) = (0.87 - 0.25) / 0.8 = 0.9625

Now, we can write the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male, P(male|correct), and the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, P(male|incorrect), in a Bayes' theorem-like equation:

P(M|witness_male) = [P(witness_male|M) * P(M)] / [P(witness_male|M) * P(M) + P(witness_male|F) * P(F)]

We know P(witness_male|M) = 0.15, P(witness_male|F) = 0.05 (since the witness errs 20% of the time), P(M) = 0.15, and P(F) = 0.85.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(M|witness_male) = [0.15 * 0.15] / [0.15 * 0.15 + 0.05 * 0.85] = 0.0229

Since we are looking for P(M), not P(M|witness_male), we need to find 1 - P(F|witness_male), which is the complementary probability:

P(M) = 1 - P(F|witness_male) = 1 - [0.0229 / (0.0229 + 0.0425)] = 0.9471
