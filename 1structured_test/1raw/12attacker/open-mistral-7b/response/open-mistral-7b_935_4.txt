Given the information provided, we can make an estimate based on the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If the attacker's gender is indeed male, the witness will correctly identify it 80% of the time. However, if the attacker is female, the witness will incorrectly identify her as male 20% of the time (given that 85% of the population is female).

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male). We want to find the value of P(male) that maximizes the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender as male, which is 0.8 * P(male) + 0.2 * (1 - P(female)).

Since we don't have information about P(female), we can't find the exact value of P(male) that maximizes this probability. However, we can find an upper bound for P(male) by assuming that the witness's error rate is entirely due to misidentifying females as males. In this case, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (as stated in the information), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.2.

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of a randomly chosen person being female is 0.85, and the probability of a randomly chosen person being male is 0.15.

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, the probability of a randomly chosen person being misidentified as male by the witness is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is greater than 0.8 - 0.17 = 0.63, or 63%.
