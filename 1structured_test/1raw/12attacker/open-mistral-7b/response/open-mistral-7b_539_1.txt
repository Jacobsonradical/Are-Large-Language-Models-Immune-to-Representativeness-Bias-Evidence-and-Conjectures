Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement that the attacker is male. The prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the probability of the hypothesis before considering any evidence, is given as 15% in the first piece of information.

The likelihood of the evidence, given the hypothesis, is the probability that a witness would make a correct gender identification in 80% of the cases and an incorrect identification in 20% of the cases, if the attacker is indeed male.

The likelihood of the evidence, given the opposite hypothesis (that the attacker is female), is similar, but with the probabilities reversed: the witness would make a correct identification in 20% of the cases and an incorrect identification in 80% of the cases.

Using Bayes' theorem, the updated probability of the hypothesis (that the attacker is male) given the evidence is:

P(attacker is male | witness statement) = [P(witness statement | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male)] / [P(witness statement | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness statement | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female)]

Plugging in the given values, we get:

P(attacker is male | witness statement) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the probabilities, we get:

P(attacker is male | witness statement) â‰ˆ 0.12

So, given the witness's statement, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 12%.
