Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

Let:
- P(M) be the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we can estimate from the city's population statistics (P(M) = 0.15)
- P(~M) be the prior probability of the attacker being female (P(~M) = 0.85)
- P(W|M) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker (0.8, as given in the problem)
- P(W|~M) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male (0.2, as given in the problem)

The goal is to find P(M|W), the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)]

Plugging in the given values, we get:

P(M|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.41 (approximately 41%)

So, our estimate, based on the given information, is that the attacker is male with a probability of approximately 41%.
