Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% and they make an error 20% of the time. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

However, we don't have enough information to directly apply the witness's success rate to this specific situation. The witness's accuracy rate is based on a general population, but we don't know if the attacker's gender fits into the typical gender presentation or expectations in the witness's frame of reference.

Therefore, it's not possible to provide a strict numerical estimate based on this information alone. It would require additional context or information to make a more informed estimate.
