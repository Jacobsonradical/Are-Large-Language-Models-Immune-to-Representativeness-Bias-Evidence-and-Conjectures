Given the two pieces of information, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. The population composition: The city has an 85% female population and a 15% male population.
2. The reliability of the witness: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

However, there's an important distinction to make between these two pieces of information. The population composition (85% female, 15% male) tells us the probability that a randomly selected person is male. But the witness's reliability tells us something about how accurately the witness can identify gender, not about the actual composition of the attacker's gender.

The witness's statement that the attacker is male should be treated as evidence, but it's not sufficient to change our initial estimate of the population composition without considering the witness's reliability.

To incorporate the witness's reliability, we should use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability based on new evidence. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability (the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement) is equal to the product of the prior probability (the probability of the attacker being male before considering the witness's statement) and the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is male, divided by the sum of the product of the prior probability and the likelihood for both male and female.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male (our initial estimate based on the population composition)
- P(M|W) as the probability that the witness says "male" given that the attacker is male
- P(F|W) as the probability that the witness says "male" given that the attacker is female

According to the witness's statement, P(M|W) = 1 and P(F|W) = 0. However, these numbers are not meaningful since they don't account for the witness's reliability. Instead, we can use the witness's reliability to calculate these probabilities based on the true gender of the attacker.

Assuming that the attacker's gender is random, we can expect the witness to correctly identify the gender 80% of the time, which means P(M|W) = 0.8 and P(F|W) = 0.2.

Using these values, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(M) * P(W|M)] / [P(M) * P(W|M) + P(F) * P(W|F)]

Since we don't know the actual value of P(M) (the prior probability), we can't directly compute the posterior probability. However, we can find the ratio of the posterior probabilities for male and female:

P(M|W) / P(F|W) = [P(M) * P(W|M)] / [P(F) * P(W|F)]

Given that the population composition is 85% female and 15% male, we can estimate that P(M) = 0.15 and P(F) = 0.85. Using these values, we get:

P(M|W) / P(F|W) ≈ [0.15 * 0.8] / [0.85 * 0.2] = 0.12

Since P(M|W) / P(F|W) is the ratio of the posterior probabilities, we can estimate that P(M|W) ≈ 0.12 * P(F|W). Since P(F|W) = 0.2, we can estimate that P(M|W) ≈ 0.024.

Therefore, based on the population composition and the witness's reliability, we estimate that the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 2.4%. However, this estimate is based on several assumptions, including the validity of Bayes' theorem, the witness's reliability in identifying gender, and the assumption that the attacker's gender is random. In a real-world scenario, additional evidence or information may be available to help refine this estimate.
