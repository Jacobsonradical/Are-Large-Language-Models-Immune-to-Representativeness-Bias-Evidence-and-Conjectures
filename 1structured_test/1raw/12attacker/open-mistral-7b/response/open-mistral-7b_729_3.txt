To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and considering that the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the witness misidentifying a male as female.

Since there are more females in the population, it's more likely that the witness will see a female and incorrectly identify them as male (type II error). The probability of this happening is the proportion of females in the population multiplied by the error rate, which is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

Now, to find the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, we subtract the probability of the type II error from 100%. This gives us 100% - 17% = 83%.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability of the witness making a correct identification, which is 83%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is: {probability: 0.83}
