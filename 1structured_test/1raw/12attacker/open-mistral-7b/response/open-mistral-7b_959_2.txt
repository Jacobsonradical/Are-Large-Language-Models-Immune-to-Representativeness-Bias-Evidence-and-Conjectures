To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence (the witness's identification of the attacker as male).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being male.
- Evidence B is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

From the provided information, we have:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, which is given as 0.8.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is the probability we want to find.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, which is the sum of the probabilities of her correctly identifying a male and incorrectly identifying a female:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know that P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, which is given as 0.2. We also know that P(not A) is the probability of the attacker being female, which is 1 - P(A).

Using the given information that the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can find P(not A) as 0.15.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.15

We don't have a direct way to find P(A), but we can rewrite Bayes' theorem to solve for P(A):

P(A) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Substituting the values we have for P(B|A) and P(B), we get:

P(A) = (0.8 * P(A)) / [0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.15]

To solve for P(A), we can set up an equation and solve for P(A):

0.8 * P(A) = P(B)
0.8 * P(A) = (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.15)
0.64 * P(A) = 0.15
P(A) = 0.15 / 0.64
P(A) â‰ˆ 0.2344

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 23.44%.
