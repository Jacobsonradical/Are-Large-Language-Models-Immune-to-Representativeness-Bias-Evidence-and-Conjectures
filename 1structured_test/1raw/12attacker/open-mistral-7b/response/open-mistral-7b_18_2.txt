To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.

Since we don't have specific information about the witness's errors, we cannot directly apply the population distribution to the witness's judgement. However, we can make an assumption that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between misidentifying females as males and misidentifying males as females.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being male as 'p'. The probability of the witness misidentifying a female as a male is then 0.2p (since 20% of the time, the witness errs).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of this event occurring if the attacker is indeed male is simply 'p'. The probability of this event occurring if the attacker is female and the witness errs is 0.2p.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write the following probability equation:

p (probability of the attacker being male) + 0.2p (probability of the witness misidentifying a female as a male) = 0.8 (the probability the witness correctly identified the attacker as male)

Solving for 'p', we get:

p = 0.8 / (1 + 0.2)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.78 or 78%. This estimate assumes that the witness's errors are evenly distributed between misidentifying females as males and misidentifying males as females. However, without specific information about the witness's errors, this is just an assumption.
