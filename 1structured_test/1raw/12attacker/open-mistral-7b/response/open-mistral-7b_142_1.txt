To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution of the city's population.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The actual gender distribution: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Let's assume that the attacker is actually female (event A) and the attacker is actually male (event M). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly if the attacker is female (P(W|A)) is 20% (since the witness errs 80% of the time when the attacker is female). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly if the attacker is male (P(W|M)) is 80% (since the witness correctly identifies male gender 80% of the time).

Given the witness's statement, we know that the witness identified the attacker as male (event W). Therefore, we are looking for the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male (P(M|W)).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(M|W) as follows:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|A) * P(A))

Substituting the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85))

Calculating the probability:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.249

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 24.9%.
