Given the information provided, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% with an error rate of 20%. We don't have direct information about the attacker's gender, but we do know that the population is predominantly female (85%).

The witness's identification of the attacker as male could be due to a correct identification or an error. Let's calculate the probability of each:

1. Probability of the attacker being male and the witness correctly identifying him:
   This probability is equal to the probability of the attacker being male times the probability of the witness correctly identifying him as male, which is 0.15 (probability of male) * 0.8 (correct identification rate) = 0.12.

2. Probability of the attacker being male and the witness making an error:
   This probability is equal to the probability of the attacker being male times the probability of the witness making an error, which is 0.15 (probability of male) * 0.2 (error rate) = 0.03.

3. Probability of the attacker being female and the witness correctly identifying her:
   This probability is equal to the probability of the attacker being female times the probability of the witness correctly identifying her as male, which is 0.85 (probability of female) * 0.2 (error rate) = 0.17.

4. Probability of the attacker being female and the witness making no error:
   This probability is equal to the probability of the attacker being female times the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying her as male, which is 0.85 (probability of female) * 0.8 (correct identification rate) = 0.68.

5. The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is the sum of the probabilities in points 1 and 2, which is 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15.

6. The total probability of the witness not identifying the attacker as male is the sum of the probabilities in points 3 and 4, which is 0.17 + 0.68 = 0.85.

Since the witness has identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is equal to the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which is 0.15.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.15}.
