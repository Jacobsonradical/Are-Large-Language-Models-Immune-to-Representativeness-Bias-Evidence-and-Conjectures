Given the two pieces of information:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male (a).
2. A witness, who is 80% accurate in identifying gender and makes errors 20% of the time (b), identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy.

The witness's statement about the attacker being male could be correct due to the attacker indeed being male or due to the witness making a mistake. Let's calculate the probabilities for both scenarios:

1. The attacker is male:
   - Probability of the attacker being male in the population is 15% (from a).
   - Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 (from b).

2. The attacker is female:
   - Probability of the attacker being female in the population is 85% (from a).
   - Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is 0.2 (from b).

Now, we can calculate the overall probabilities for both scenarios and sum them up to get the estimated probability that the attacker is male:

(Probability of attacker being male * Witness's accuracy) + (Probability of attacker being female * Witness's error rate)
= (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%.
