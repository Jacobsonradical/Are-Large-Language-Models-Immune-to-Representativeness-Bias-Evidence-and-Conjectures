To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness has a 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender, but in this case, they mistakenly identified the attacker as male. This means that there is a 20% chance that the witness was incorrect, and the attacker could actually be female.

However, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This means that even if the witness is correct, the attacker is more likely to be female.

To find the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city. We can do this by calculating the probability of the witness being correct (the attacker is male) and multiplying it by the actual probability of the attacker being male in the population, and then compare it with the probability of the witness being incorrect (the attacker is female) and multiplying it by the actual probability of the attacker being female in the population.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M) and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F).

We know that P(M) + P(F) = 1 and P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male).

The witness is correct 80% of the time, so the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male is 0.8. The probability of the witness being incorrect given that the attacker is male is 0.2.

The witness is incorrect 20% of the time, so the probability of the witness being incorrect given that the attacker is female is 0.2. The probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is female is 0.8.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male is the probability of the witness being correct multiplied by the probability of the attacker being male in the population, plus the probability of the witness being incorrect multiplied by the probability of the attacker being female in the population:

P(M) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)

Calculating this, we get:

P(M) = 0.12 + 0.1765 = 0.2965

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 29.65%.
