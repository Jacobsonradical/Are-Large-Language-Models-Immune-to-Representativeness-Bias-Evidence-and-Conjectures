To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence (in this case, the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability of the attacker being male in the city),
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (witness's identification),
- P(H | E) is the probability we are interested in (probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification),
- P(E | H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker).

Given the information provided, we can calculate these probabilities as follows:

1. P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
2. P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
3. P(E | ~H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying gender 20% of the time, where ~H denotes "not male")
4. P(H | E) = ? (the probability we are interested in)

We can't directly calculate P(E) because it depends on the specific population and the witness's identification of all individuals, neither of which we have enough information for. However, since we're only interested in the ratio P(H | E) / P(~H | E), we don't need to calculate P(E).

Instead, we can use the formula:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ~H) * P(~H)]

Substituting the values we have, we get:

P(H | E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us:

P(H | E) â‰ˆ 0.23

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 23%.
