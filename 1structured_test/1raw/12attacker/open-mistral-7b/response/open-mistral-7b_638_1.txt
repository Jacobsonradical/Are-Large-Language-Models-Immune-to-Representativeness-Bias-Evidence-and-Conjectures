Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population distribution and the witness's ability to identify gender.

1. From the population distribution, we know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male. However, this information does not directly help us determine the gender of the attacker since the attacker's gender was not observed.

2. The witness's ability to identify gender correctly is 80% of the time, but they also make errors 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as male. However, this does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually male, as the witness could have made an error.

Given that we cannot directly use the population distribution to infer the attacker's gender and the witness's identification could be incorrect, we cannot provide a definitive probability estimate based on this information alone.

To calculate a probability, we would need more information or make assumptions that go beyond the given data. For example, we could assume that the witness's error rate is the same for males and females, or we could estimate the probability based on the witness's confidence level. Without such assumptions, it is not possible to provide a reliable probability estimate.

Therefore, the strict answer to your question is: {probability: undefined, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
