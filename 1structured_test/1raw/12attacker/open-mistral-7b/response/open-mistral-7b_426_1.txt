Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the hypothesis A given the evidence B
- P(B|A) is the probability of the evidence B given the hypothesis A
- P(A) is the prior probability of the hypothesis A
- P(B) is the probability of the evidence B

In this case, A is the attacker being male, and B is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

From the information provided, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male, given that 85% of the population is female)
- P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male)
- P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * P(not A) (given that the witness was correct 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time)

Given that P(A) = 0.15, we can find P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.1725 = 0.2925

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.2925 = 0.205

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.205 or 20.5%.
