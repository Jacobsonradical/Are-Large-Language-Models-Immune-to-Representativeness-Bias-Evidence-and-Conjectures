To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information provided about the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

2. The gender distribution in the city: 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a female as male (Type I error) and the probability that the witness correctly identified a male (Type II correct).

Type I error probability:
P(Witness mistakes female as male) = 0.15 (probability of a male in the city) * 0.20 (probability of the witness erring) = 0.03

Type II correct probability:
P(Witness correctly identifies male) = 0.15 (probability of a male in the city) * 0.80 (probability of the witness being correct) = 0.12

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the probability of a Type II correct event. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
