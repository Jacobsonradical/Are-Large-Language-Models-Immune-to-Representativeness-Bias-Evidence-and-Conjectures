To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:

- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as male
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we can estimate from the population statistics given in point "a"
- P(E|H): the likelihood of a witness correctly identifying a male attacker, given in point "b"
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of a witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male, which can be calculated as 1 - P(E|H) since the witness is wrong in 20% of the cases
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 1 - P(H)

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

We can plug in the values we have:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this, we get:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.153

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's evidence, is approximately 15.3%.
