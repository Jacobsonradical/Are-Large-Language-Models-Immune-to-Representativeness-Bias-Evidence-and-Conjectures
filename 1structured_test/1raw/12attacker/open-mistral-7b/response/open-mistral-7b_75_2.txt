To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the attacker's gender was not clearly visible, there's a chance that the witness made an error. Let's denote the true gender of the attacker as T (either male or female), and let's denote the witness's incorrect gender identification as E (either incorrectly identifying a male as female or incorrectly identifying a female as male).

Given the information that the witness identified the attacker as male (M), we can write two probabilities:

1) P(M|T) is the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, P(M|T) = 0.8.

2) P(M|E) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male. Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, and the city is predominantly female (85%), we can assume that most of the times the witness errs, they identify a female as a male. So, P(M|E) is the probability that the witness errs when identifying a female. Since there are twice as many females as males in the city, P(M|E) = 0.15 * 0.2 / (0.15 * 0.2 + 0.85 * 0.8) = 0.02.

Now, we need to find the probability of the event that the witness identified the attacker as male (M), given that the actual gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male. This can be written as P(M) = P(M|T) * P(T) + P(M|E) * P(E), where P(T) is the probability of a true male attacker and P(E) is the probability of an erroneous female attacker.

Since the city is predominantly female, we can assume that most attacks are carried out by females. Thus, P(E) is the probability that the attacker is a female and the witness incorrectly identifies her as a male. Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, and there are twice as many females as males in the city, we can calculate P(E) as P(E) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(M) as P(M) = P(M|T) * P(T) + P(M|E) * P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.02 * 0.17 = 0.184.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.184}. This means that, given the witness's ability to identify gender and the gender distribution in the city, there's approximately a 18.4% chance that the attacker is male.
