Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population statistics and the witness's testimony.

1. According to the population statistics, the probability of the attacker being male is 15% or 0.15.

2. The witness, who was correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male. However, we don't know how many times the witness saw a person of uncertain gender in similar conditions. If the witness only saw people with clear gender characteristics, the 80% accuracy might not be representative of the attacker situation.

3. Without more specific information about the witness's accuracy in identifying the gender of people with ambiguous characteristics, it's not possible to accurately adjust the initial population probability. Therefore, we can't provide a more precise estimate than the initial 15%.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.15}
