To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have specific information about the gender of the attacker, we can treat both "male" and "female" as possibilities and calculate the probability for each.

1. If the attacker is female:
   - The probability of the witness saying "male" when the attacker is female is the error rate, 20%.
   - The probability of the witness saying "female" when the attacker is female is 1 - error rate = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
   - Since the witness said "male", the likelihood of the attacker being female given this witness statement is 0.2.

2. If the attacker is male:
   - The probability of the witness saying "male" when the attacker is male is the correct identification rate, 80%.
   - The probability of the witness saying "female" when the attacker is male is the error rate, 20%.
   - Since the witness said "male", the likelihood of the attacker being male given this witness statement is 0.8.

Given that the city has an 85% female population and a 15% male population, we can also calculate the prior probability of the attacker being male. However, the witness's statement already provides us with a likelihood ratio (0.8 for male vs. 0.2 for female), which we can use to update our belief about the attacker's gender based on Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that for two hypotheses A and B, the probability of A given B is proportional to the probability of B given A times the prior probability of A: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness says "male".

However, we cannot directly calculate the prior probability of the attacker being male from the given information. Therefore, we cannot provide a strict numerical answer, but based on the witness's statement, the likelihood of the attacker being male seems to be higher than the gender distribution in the city suggests.

{probability: higher than 0.15, but a strict numerical value cannot be provided without additional information}
