To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. From the population statistics provided (85% female and 15% male), we can infer that the attacker is more likely to be female.

2. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is only 80%, which means they are prone to errors. In this case, the witness identified the attacker as male, but there's a chance they made a mistake.

3. To account for the witness's error rate, we need to calculate the probability that the witness would have made a mistake in identifying a female attacker as male. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of picking a female at random is 0.85.

4. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 20%.

5. Since the witness made the identification of the attacker as male, we can assume that there's a 20% chance that the attacker is actually female.

6. As the witness correctly identified the attacker as male in this case, we can now calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed male given the witness's identification. This is the conditional probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

7. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event that the attacker is male, B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male, P(A) is the probability of the attacker being male, P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, and P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker.

8. We know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male), and P(B) = 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.68 (the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male).

9. Substituting these values into the conditional probability formula, we get P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.68 â‰ˆ 0.139 (or 13.9%).

Therefore, given the population distribution, the witness's gender identification accuracy, and the witness's identification of the attacker as male, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 13.9%.
