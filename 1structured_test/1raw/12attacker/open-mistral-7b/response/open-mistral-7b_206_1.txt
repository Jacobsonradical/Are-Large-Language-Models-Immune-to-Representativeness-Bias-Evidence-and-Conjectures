To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male if the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here,
- A is the event that the attacker is male,
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred 20% of the time)
  P(not A) = 0.85 (the rest of the population is female)

Calculating P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.34, or 34%.
