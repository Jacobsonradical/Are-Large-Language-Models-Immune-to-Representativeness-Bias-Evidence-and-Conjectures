To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually male (true positive).
2. The witness made an error and incorrectly identified a female as male (false positive).

Let's denote the probability of a female attacker as p and the probability of a male attacker as 1-p. According to the given information, p = 0.85 and 1-p = 0.15.

The probability of a true positive (the attacker is male) is equal to the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability of a true positive is 0.8.

The probability of a false positive (witness mistakes a female attacker for a male) is equal to the probability that a female attacker is mistaken for a male by the witness, which is the product of the probability of a female attacker and the probability that the witness makes an error:

p * (1 - 0.80) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

The probability that the attacker is male is the sum of the probability of a true positive and the probability of a false positive:

probability = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.97, or 97%.
