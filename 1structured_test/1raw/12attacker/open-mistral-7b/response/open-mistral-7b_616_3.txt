Given the information provided, the population of the city is 85% female and 15% male. However, a witness identified the attacker as male with an accuracy rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%. This implies that when the witness is presented with a person of unknown gender, they will incorrectly identify a female as male 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possibilities:
1. The attacker is actually male (correct identification by the witness).
2. The attacker is female, but the witness incorrectly identified her as male (error by the witness).

The probability of the first possibility is the actual proportion of males in the population, which is 15%. The probability of the second possibility is the error rate of the witness, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 15% (correct identification) + 20% (error identification) * 15% (probability of a female being mistaken for a male) = 0.15 (15%) + 0.03 (3%) = 0.18 or 18%.

So, strictly in the dictionary format: {probability: 0.18}
