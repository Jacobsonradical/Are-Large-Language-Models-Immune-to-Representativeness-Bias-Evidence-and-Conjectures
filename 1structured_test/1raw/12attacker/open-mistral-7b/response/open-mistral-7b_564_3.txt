To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Given these facts, let's assume that the witness saw the attacker for long enough to have a reasonable chance of identifying the gender. In this case, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male is 0.15 * 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.01875 or 1.875% (rounded up to 2%).

So, the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (correctly or incorrectly) is 0.8 + 0.01875 = 0.81875 or 81.875%.

However, since we are interested in the probability that the attacker is actually male, we need to consider the city's gender distribution. In this case, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 or 15%.

Comparing the witness's total probability of identifying the attacker as male with the actual probability of the attacker being male, it appears that the witness's identification is biased towards male, as the witness's total probability (81.875%) is much higher than the actual probability (15%).

Therefore, based on the witness's identification and the city's gender distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 or 15%.
