Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. However, we also have information about the witness's ability to correctly identify gender. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, but erred 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male. But since we don't know if this identification was correct or not, we can't directly use the population percentages.
4. Instead, we can consider the witness's identification as an additional piece of evidence. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, there's a 20% chance that the witness's identification of the attacker as male was an error.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually female, given the witness's identification, is 20%.
6. To find the probability that the attacker is male, we subtract this probability from 1: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.8} or 80%.
