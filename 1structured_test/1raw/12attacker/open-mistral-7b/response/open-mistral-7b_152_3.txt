To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's gender is unknown and the witness makes a guess, the probability of the witness guessing correctly (the attacker is male) is equal to the witness's success rate.

However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This information suggests that even if the witness makes a random guess, they are more likely to guess female due to the city's gender distribution.

To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness guessing correctly by taking into account both the witness's success rate and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the witness guessing correctly as P(male). We can write an equation to represent this probability:

P(male) = Witness's success rate * Probability of attacker being male given city's gender distribution + Witness's error rate * Probability of attacker being female given city's gender distribution

The probability of the attacker being male given the city's gender distribution is 15% (since 15% of the population is male). The probability of the attacker being female given the city's gender distribution is 85% (since 85% of the population is female).

Now, we can substitute these values into the equation:

P(male) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

P(male) = 0.12 + 0.17

P(male) = 0.29

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 29%.
