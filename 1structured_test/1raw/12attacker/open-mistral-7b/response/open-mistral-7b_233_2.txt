To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's gender identification.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is male
- ¬A as the event that the attacker is female
- E as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is unknown but can be estimated based on the city's population data (given in b).
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being female.
P(E|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker, given by the witness's ability in a).
P(E|¬A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male, also given by the witness's ability in a).

From the information given, we can calculate P(E|A) = 0.8 and P(E|¬A) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification is:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / (P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|¬A) * P(¬A))

We can use the given information about the city's population to estimate P(A) and P(¬A). From b, we know that 85% of the population is female, so P(¬A) = 0.15, and P(A) = 0.85.

So, P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.85) / ((0.8 * 0.85) + (0.2 * 0.15)) ≈ 0.68

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.68 or 68%.
