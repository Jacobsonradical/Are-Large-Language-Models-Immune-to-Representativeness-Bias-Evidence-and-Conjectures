To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief in the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (the attacker is male)
- E is the evidence (the witness's identification)
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

From the information given, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (80% chance of correct identification)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% male population)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
  P(E|not H) = 0.2 (20% chance of error)
  P(not H) = 0.85 (85% female population)
  P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.164

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.164 â‰ˆ 0.484

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.484 or 48.4%.
