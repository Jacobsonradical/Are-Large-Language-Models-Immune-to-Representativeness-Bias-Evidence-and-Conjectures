Given the two pieces of information, we have some conflicting evidence.

1. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. This suggests that the attacker has a high probability of being female.

2. However, a witness identified the attacker as male, and their ability to correctly identify gender is 80% accurate. This suggests that the attacker might actually be male, but with a lower probability than suggested by the city's population.

Since we cannot directly combine these two probabilities due to their contradictory nature, we can only provide an estimate based on the witness's reliability.

Let's calculate the probability of the witness's mistake, given that the attacker is actually female. If the attacker is female and the witness is incorrect, this would mean that the witness misidentified a female as male. Given that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time and half of the population is female, the probability of a witness mistake under these conditions is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10%.

This means that when the attacker is actually female, the witness will correctly identify the gender 90% of the time. Since the city's population is 85% female, the overall probability that the attacker is female, given the witness's statement, is the probability of the witness being correct times the probability of the attacker being female (0.9 * 0.85).

Calculating this, we get 0.765 or approximately 76.5%.

However, the witness's statement contradicts the city's population statistics, and we cannot ignore this. Therefore, it is not appropriate to assign a single probability to the attacker's gender. Instead, we recommend further investigation to resolve this contradiction.
