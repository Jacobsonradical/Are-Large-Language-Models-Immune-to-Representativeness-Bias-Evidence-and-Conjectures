Given the information provided, the attacker's gender is initially unknown because the victim could not see the attacker. However, a witness later identified the attacker as male. The reliability of the witness's gender identification is given as 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. The witness's identification of the attacker as male does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually male, as the witness may have made an error.

The probability that the witness's identification is correct is 0.8, and the probability that the witness's identification is incorrect is 0.2. Since the city's population is biased towards females, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

Given the witness's identification and the prior probability of the attacker's gender, we can compute the posterior probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is male | witness's identification) = P(witness's identification | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) / [P(witness's identification | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness's identification | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female)]

We are given that P(witness's identification | attacker is male) = 0.8 and P(attacker is male) = 0.15. We need to find P(witness's identification | attacker is female) and P(attacker is female).

Since the witness is equally likely to mistake a female for a male as to mistake a male for a female, we can assume that P(witness's identification | attacker is female) = 0.2.

We are also given that the city's population is 85% female, so P(attacker is female) = 0.85.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is male | witness's identification) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(attacker is male | witness's identification) = 0.182

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 18.2%.
