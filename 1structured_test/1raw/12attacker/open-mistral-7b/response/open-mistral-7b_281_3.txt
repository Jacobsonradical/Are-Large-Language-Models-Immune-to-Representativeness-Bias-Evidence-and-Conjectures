To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness erring when the actual gender is male.

Given that 15% of the population is male, the probability of the witness erring and identifying a male as female is 0.2 (the error rate) * 0.15 (male population proportion).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is then 1 - 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.81 (81%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, which is 0.81.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.81}.
