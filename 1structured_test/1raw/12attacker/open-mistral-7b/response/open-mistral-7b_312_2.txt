To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the new evidence is the witness's observation.

Let:
P(M) = Probability of the attacker being male
P(F) = Probability of the attacker being female
P(w|M) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker
P(w|F) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male
P(w) = Probability of the witness making the observation (either correctly or incorrectly)

We are given the following information:

1. P(w|M) = 0.8
2. P(w|F) = 0.2
3. P(M) + P(F) = 1 (total probability)
4. P(F) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)

Since the witness's gender is not mentioned, we can assume that P(w) does not depend on the attacker's gender, meaning P(w) = P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F). We can rewrite this equation using the given values:

P(w) = 0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * 0.15

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(M):

P(M|w) = [P(w|M) * P(M)] / P(w)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|w) = [0.8 * P(M)] / [0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * 0.15]

Since P(M) + P(F) = 1, we have P(F) = 1 - P(M). Now we can substitute this into the equation:

P(M|w) = [0.8 * P(M)] / [0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 * (1 - P(M))]

To find the specific value of P(M), we would need more information or make an assumption. However, since the question asks for an estimate, we can analyze the given information to make an informed guess.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases, it seems plausible that the population is roughly balanced between males and females. If the population were heavily skewed toward one gender, the witness's error rate might be different. Therefore, we can assume that P(M) ≈ 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female).

Now we can substitute this value into the Bayes' theorem equation:

P(M|w) ≈ [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating this, we get an estimated probability that the attacker is male of:
