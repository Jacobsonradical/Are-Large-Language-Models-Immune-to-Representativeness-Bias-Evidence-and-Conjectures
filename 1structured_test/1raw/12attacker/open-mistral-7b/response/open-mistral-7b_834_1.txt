To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being male, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F) = 1 - P(M). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male is P(M|wM), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is P(F|wM) = 1 - P(M|wM). Similarly, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a female as female is P(F|wF), and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is P(M|wF) = 1 - P(F|wF).

From the given information, we know that P(M|wM) = 0.8, P(F|wF) = 1, P(M) = P, and P(F) = 1 - P. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(M|wM) = [P(wM|M) * P(M)] / [P(wM|M) * P(M) + P(wM|F) * P(F)]

However, we do not have the necessary information to directly calculate P(wM|M) and P(wM|F). Instead, we can use the given information about the witness's accuracy to infer these probabilities.

We know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that the witness made a correct identification in 80% of the cases where the attacker was actually male. This gives us P(wM|M) = 0.8.

Similarly, since the population is 85% female, we can assume that the witness made a correct identification in 85% of the cases where the attacker was actually female. This gives us P(wM|F) = 0.15 * (1 - 0.8) = 0.025.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(M|wM):

P(M|wM) = [0.8 * P] / [0.8 * P + 0.025 * (1 - P)]

To solve for P, we can set up an equation and solve for it:

0.8P = 0.8P + 0.025(1 - P)

0.025 = 0.12 * (1 - P)

0.025 = 0.012 * P

P = 0.025 / 0.012

P â‰ˆ 0.21

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.21. This means there is a 21% chance that the attacker is male and an 79% chance that the attacker is female.
