Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis H given some evidence E can be calculated as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is male, E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male, P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male, and P(E) is the probability of the witness making the observed identification.

From the information given, we have:

- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (from the information that 85% of the population is female)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (the probability of the witness making the observed identification, given that the attacker is female)

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.667 or 66.7%.
