To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the city's demographic statistics and the reliability of the witness's gender identification.

1. City Demographics: 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.

2. Witness's Reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as male. However, we cannot directly use this information because we don't know if the witness was correct or not in this specific case. If the witness was incorrect, then the attacker is actually female, which contradicts the city's demographic statistics.

Since we don't know the actual gender of the attacker, we can only consider the possibility of the witness being correct. Let's calculate the probability of the witness being correct given the city's demographic statistics.

The probability of a randomly chosen person in the city being male is 0.15 (15%). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is 0.20 (20%).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is therefore: 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 (80%)

The probability of the witness's identification being correct given that the actual attacker is male is 0.80.

However, the witness's identification could also be correct if the attacker is actually female and the witness correctly identifies her as male. The probability of this happening is the probability of a randomly chosen person in the city being female (0.85) times the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male (0.20).

So, the probability of the witness's identification being correct given that the actual attacker is female is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 (17%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male (0.80) plus the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is female (0.17), which is 0.80 + 0.17 = 0.97 (97%)

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's gender identification ability is independent of the attacker's gender. If there is any bias or error in the witness's gender identification that depends on the gender of the person, then this estimate may not be accurate.
