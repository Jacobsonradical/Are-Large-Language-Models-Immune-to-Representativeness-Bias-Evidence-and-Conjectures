To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male (before considering the witness's statement)
- P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female (before considering the witness's statement)
- P(witness said male | attacker is male) as the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker
- P(witness said male | attacker is female) as the likelihood of the witness mistakenly identifying a female attacker as male

We are given that P(M) + P(F) = 1 (the attacker is either male or female), and that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that:

P(witness said male | attacker is male) = 0.8
P(witness said male | attacker is female) = 0.2

We are also given that 85% of the population in the city is female, so P(F) = 0.85. To find P(M), we can use the given information:

P(M) = 1 - P(F) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now we can calculate the probability of the witness saying "male" given the attacker's gender using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is male | witness said male) = P(witness said male | attacker is male) * P(M) / (P(witness said male | attacker is male) * P(M) + P(witness said male | attacker is female) * P(F))

Plugging in the values we have, we get:

P(attacker is male | witness said male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this, we get:

P(attacker is male | witness said male) = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
