Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the relationship between prior knowledge and new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is male
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

From the information given, we have two probabilities:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability, or the probability of the attacker being male before considering the witness's testimony)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the likelihood, or the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
3. P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the likelihood, or the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

P(~A) is the probability of the attacker being female, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of A given B is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.164

So, given the witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 16.4%.
