Given the information provided, the attacker's gender is initially unknown to us. However, we do have a witness who claims to have identified the attacker as male, and their ability to accurately identify gender is known to be 80% accurate.

The population information (85% female, 15% male) is not directly relevant to the witness's identification, as we are dealing with the witness's ability to identify gender, not the actual gender distribution of the attacker.

So, based on the witness's ability to identify gender, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (or 80%), as suggested by the witness's statement. This estimate assumes that the witness's ability to identify gender is accurate in this specific case.
