Given the information provided, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, while they err 20% of the time. However, we know that 85% of the population in the city is female and 15% is male. This means that there is a bias towards more females in the population.

Given this bias, it's likely that the witness would err more often when identifying the attacker as male, as there are fewer men in the population. Therefore, we might expect the witness's actual error rate for identifying the attacker's gender to be higher than 20%.

However, without more specific information, we can't calculate an exact probability. We can only say that, based on the witness's ability and the gender distribution in the population, it's more likely than not that the attacker is female.

Therefore, I cannot provide a strict numerical estimate in the requested format. The situation is complex and requires additional information to make a reliable probability estimate.
