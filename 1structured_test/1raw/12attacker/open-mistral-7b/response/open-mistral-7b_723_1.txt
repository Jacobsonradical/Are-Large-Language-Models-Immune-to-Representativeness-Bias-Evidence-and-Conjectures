To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F).

From the given information (b), we know that 85% of the population is female, so P(F) = 0.85. Since the total population is 100%, we can also find the probability of the attacker being male, which is P(M) = 1 - P(F) = 0.15.

However, the witness's accuracy in gender identification is not directly related to the actual gender distribution in the population. Instead, we should consider the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker as a male (P(Correct|M)) and the probability of the witness identifying a female attacker as a male (P(Error|F)).

From the given information (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. Since the attacker's gender is unknown, let's assume an attacker's gender is randomly chosen from the population. Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of choosing a female attacker is 0.85.

So, we can calculate P(Correct|M) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, which is 1 (since the attacker is indeed male). We can calculate P(Error|F) as the probability of the witness erring and identifying a female attacker as male, which is 0.2 (the error rate).

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male (P(Correct|M)), and the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female (P(Error|F)). Since we don't know the attacker's gender, we should consider both possibilities and take their weighted average:

P(Identified as male) = P(Correct|M) * P(M) + P(Error|F) * P(F)

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

P(Identified as male) = 1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(Identified as male) = 0.15 + 0.17625
P(Identified as male) â‰ˆ 0.32625

So, based on the witness's ability to judge a person's gender and the gender distribution in the city, we estimate the probability that the attacker is male to be approximately 0.32625 or 32.625%.
