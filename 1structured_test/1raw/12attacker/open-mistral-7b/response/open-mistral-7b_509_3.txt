To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(female).

We know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this means that the witness made a correct identification 80% of the time or the attacker is indeed male 80% of the time.

However, we also know that 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male. Given this information, it's more likely that the witness made a mistake and identified a female as male. In other words, the probability of the attacker being female given the witness's statement is higher than the probability of the attacker being male.

To find the probability of the attacker being male, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(male | witness statement) = P(witness statement | male) * P(male) / P(witness statement)

We know P(witness statement | male) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified male 80% of the time), P(male) = 0.15 (from the population statistics), and we need to find P(witness statement).

To find P(witness statement), we can use the fact that the witness makes an error 20% of the time:

P(witness statement) = P(witness statement | male) * P(male) + P(witness statement | female) * P(female)

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, P(witness statement | female) = 0.2.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(male | witness statement) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives us:

P(male | witness statement) â‰ˆ 0.291

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.291 (29.1%). This means that, given the witness statement and the gender statistics of the city, it's more likely that the attacker is female, but the attacker is still slightly more likely to be male than female.
