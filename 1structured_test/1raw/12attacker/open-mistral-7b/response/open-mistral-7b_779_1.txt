To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). The probability that the witness misidentified the gender of the attacker as female, given that the attacker is male, is P(female|male) = 0.2 (from the given information).

Similarly, the probability that the witness misidentified the gender of the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female, is P(male|female) = 0.8 (from the given information).

The probability that the attacker is female is 1 - P(male) = P(female).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the likelihood of this event happening if the attacker is male is high. So, we can set up a Bayes' theorem equation:

P(male|witnessed as male) = [P(witnessed as male|male) * P(male)] / [P(witnessed as male|male) * P(male) + P(witnessed as male|female) * P(female)]

Plugging in the values:

P(male|witnessed as male) = [0.8 * P(male)] / [0.8 * P(male) + 0.2 * (1 - P(male))]

We are given that 85% of the population is female, or P(female) = 0.85. So, we can solve for P(male):

P(male|witnessed as male) = (0.8 * P(male)) / (0.8 * P(male) + 0.2 * 0.15)

Solving for P(male):

P(male) = (0.8 * P(male|witnessed as male)) / 0.6

P(male|witnessed as male) = 0.8

So, P(male) = (0.8 * 0.8) / 0.6 = 0.66666666666667

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.67 or 67%.
