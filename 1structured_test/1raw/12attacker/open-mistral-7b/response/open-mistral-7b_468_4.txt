To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as p. The probability that the witness misidentifies a male as female is 20% = 0.2. The probability that the witness misidentifies a female as male is also 20% = 0.2, since the error rate is the same for both genders.

Given that the witness identifies the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is truly male is p, and the probability that the witness is mistaken is 0.2. So, the likelihood ratio is p / 0.2.

Since the witness identifies the attacker as male, the probability of this event happening given that the attacker is male is p. On the other hand, given that the attacker is female, the probability of the witness misidentifying the attacker as male is 0.2. So, the probability of this event happening given that the attacker is female is 0.2 * 0.85 (since there's an 85% chance of having a female attacker).

The posterior probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's report, is the product of these two probabilities, divided by the sum of these probabilities:

p * (p + 0.2 * 0.85) / (p + 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15)

Substituting the witness's error rate of 20% (0.2) and the gender distribution of 85% female and 15% male, we get:

p * (p + 0.034) / (p + 0.028)

This is a nonlinear equation that can only be solved numerically. Solving this equation, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.468.
