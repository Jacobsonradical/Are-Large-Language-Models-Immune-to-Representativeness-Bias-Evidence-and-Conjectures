Given the information provided, let's reason through this problem step by step:

1. We know that a witness, who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.
2. In the city, 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.
3. Since the witness' error rate is 20%, it means that, when the actual gender is female, the witness will mistakenly identify it as male 20% of the time.
4. Therefore, the probability of the witness making a correct gender identification (male) when the actual gender is male is 1 - error rate = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (or 80%).
5. Similarly, the probability of the witness making a correct gender identification (female) when the actual gender is female is also 0.8 (since the error rate is the same for both genders).
6. However, because 85% of the population is female, the probability of an actual female attacker is higher than the probability of an actual male attacker.
7. Therefore, the overall probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is lower than the probability of the witness making a correct gender identification when the actual gender is male (0.8).

Given these considerations, it's not straightforward to provide a single, definite probability estimate. However, we can attempt to make an approximation by considering the city's gender distribution and the witness's error rate.

To provide a numerical estimate, let's assume that the actual gender distribution of attackers in the city is similar to the city's overall gender distribution (85% female and 15% male). In this case, the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15%).

However, since the witness's error rate is 20%, there's a chance that the witness mistakenly identified a female attacker as male. Given that 85% of the attackers are female, the probability of the witness making this mistake is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Adding the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (0.8) and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female attacker as male (0.17), we get a total probability of 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97 (or 97%).

This total probability is significantly higher than the actual probability of a male attacker in the city (0.15), suggesting that the witness's identification may not be reliable in this context.

In conclusion, while it's not possible to provide a single, definitive probability estimate, the information provided suggests that the probability of the attacker being male is likely higher than 0.15 (15%) but significantly lower than the total probability calculated above (0.97 or 97%). It's important to consider the limitations of the witness's testimony and the potential for gender misidentification in this case.

{probability: approximately between 0.15 and 0.97, with a strong bias towards 0.15}
