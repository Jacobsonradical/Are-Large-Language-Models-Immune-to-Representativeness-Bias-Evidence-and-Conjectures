Given the information provided, the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. However, we also have a witness who, in similar conditions, correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability. Let's assume that the witness made a correct identification in this case. The probability of that event happening if the attacker was indeed male is 1 (since a correct identification would confirm the attacker's gender).

On the other hand, if the attacker was female, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as male 20% of the time. So, the probability of the witness making an error if the attacker was female is 0.2.

Since we don't know the attacker's gender for sure, we need to calculate the probability of the witness making a correct identification, given that the attacker could be either male or female. This can be done using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is male | witness identified as male) = P(witness identified as male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) / [P(witness identified as male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness identified as male | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female)]

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

P(attacker is male | witness identified as male) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this value gives us:

P(attacker is male | witness identified as male) â‰ˆ 0.236

So, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 23.6%.
