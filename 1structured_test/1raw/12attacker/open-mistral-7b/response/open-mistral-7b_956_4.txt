To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

From the given information, we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80%, and they make an error 20% of the time.

However, we also know that the witness erroneously identified the attacker as male. This means that if the attacker was actually female, the witness would have mistakenly identified her as male. Given the gender distribution in the city, the likelihood of this happening is 15% (since 15% of the population is male).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification:

P(Male | Witness's Identification) = [P(Witness's Identification | Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Witness's Identification | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness's Identification | Female) * P(Female)]

P(Witness's Identification | Male) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
P(Witness's Identification | Female) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies female as male 20% of the time)
P(Male) = 0.15 (85% female, 15% male)
P(Female) = 0.85

Calculating P(Male | Witness's Identification) gives us:

P(Male | Witness's Identification) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 12%. This is significantly lower than the city's male population percentage, suggesting that the witness may have made an error in their identification.
