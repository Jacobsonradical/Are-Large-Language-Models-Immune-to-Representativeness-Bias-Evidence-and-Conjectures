To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the actual gender distribution is 50-50 (as in the sample used to assess the witness's ability), the witness will mistakenly identify a person as the opposite gender 20% of the time.

2. The city's gender distribution: We know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The witness identified the attacker as male. However, there is a chance that the witness made an error (20% chance) due to the darkness and poor visibility. If the attacker was indeed female, the witness would erroneously identify her as male. In this case, the actual gender distribution becomes 15% female and 85% male.

To find the probability that the attacker is male, we need to account for both the city's gender distribution and the witness's reliability.

The probability of the witness being correct (attacker is male) is:
15% (male population proportion) * 80% (witness's success rate) = 12%

However, the witness might have made an error, in which case the probability that the attacker is male becomes:
85% (female population proportion) * 20% (witness's error rate) = 17%

Adding these two probabilities together, we get the overall probability that the attacker is male:
12% + 17% = 29%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 29%.
