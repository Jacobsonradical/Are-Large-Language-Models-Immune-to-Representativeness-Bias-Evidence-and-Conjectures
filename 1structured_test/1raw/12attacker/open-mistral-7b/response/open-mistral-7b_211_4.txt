To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's gender identification.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Here, P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, and P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

1. P(E|H): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male is 0.8 (from the first piece of information). The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female is 0.2. Since the attacker's gender is unknown, we can assume that the witness makes an error in identifying a male as female with the same probability as identifying a female as male. Therefore, P(E|H) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.6.

2. P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being male is unknown. However, we have information about the gender distribution in the city (from the second piece of information). Given that 85% of the population is female, the prior probability of the attacker being male is P(H) = 0.15.

3. P(E): The probability of the witness making a correct identification or an error is P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = (0.6 * 0.15) + (0.6 * 0.85) = 0.6.

4. P(H|E): By Bayes' theorem, P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.6 * 0.15) / 0.6 = 0.15 or 15%.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is male is estimated to be 0.15 or 15%.
