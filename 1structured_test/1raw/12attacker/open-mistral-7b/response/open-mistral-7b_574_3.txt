To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

Let's define our variables:

- A: The attacker is male
- Ā: The attacker is female
- E: The witness identifies the attacker as male

From the information given, we have the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability that the attacker is male = Unknown
P(Ā) = Probability that the attacker is female = 1 - P(A)
P(E|A) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male = 0.8
P(E|Ā) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female = 0.2
P(A|E) = Probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identifies the attacker as male = ? (the probability we are trying to estimate)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write P(A|E) as:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|Ā) * P(Ā)]

Since we don't know P(A), we can rewrite the equation to solve for it by multiplying both sides by P(A) / P(A) and dividing both sides by [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|Ā) * P(Ā)]:

P(A) = P(A|E) * [P(E|A) * P(Ā) + P(E|Ā) * P(A)] / P(E)

From the information provided, we know P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|Ā) * P(Ā) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A)) = 0.8P(A) + 0.2 * P(Ā).

Since 85% of the population is female (P(Ā)), we can use this information to find P(A):

P(A) = P(E|A) * [P(E|A) * P(Ā) + P(E|Ā) * P(A)] / P(E)
P(A) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))
0.2P(A) = 0.2 * (1 - P(A))
P(A) = 0.5

So, based on the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city, we estimate that the attacker is male with a probability of 0.5 or 50%. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on the given information, and other factors might influence the actual probability.
