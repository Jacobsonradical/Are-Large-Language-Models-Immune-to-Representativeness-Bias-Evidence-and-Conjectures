Given the information provided, the population is 85% female and 15% male. However, we also have a witness who incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. The witness identified the attacker as male.

The probability that the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as male can be calculated by considering both the true probability of the attacker being male and the witness's error rate.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as 'p'. Then, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.2 (20%).

Since there's an 85% chance that the attacker is female and a 15% chance that the attacker is male, the probability of the witness encountering a female and incorrectly identifying her as male is 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16 (16%).

The witness correctly identifies a male as male with probability 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Since the attacker is either male or female, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male is the sum of the probabilities of correctly identifying a male and the probabilities of incorrectly identifying a female as male:

0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.16 = 0.12 + 0.136 = 0.256

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.256 or 25.6%.
