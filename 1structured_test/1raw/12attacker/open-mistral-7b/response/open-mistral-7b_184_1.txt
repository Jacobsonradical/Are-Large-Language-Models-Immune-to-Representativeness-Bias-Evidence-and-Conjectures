Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that helps to update the probability of an event based on the occurrence of other events.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is male.
- E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
- P(E|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, given by the witness's 80% accuracy, which is 0.8.
- P(E|~A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male, given by the witness's 20% error rate, which is 0.2.
- P(~A) as the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
- P(E|~A) can be calculated as 1 - P(E|A) = 0.2.

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of A given E is:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) \* P(A) / [P(E|A) \* P(A) + P(E|~A) \* P(~A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating this, we obtain:

P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.24

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 24%.
