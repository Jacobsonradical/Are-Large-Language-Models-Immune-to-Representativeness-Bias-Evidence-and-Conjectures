To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know the actual gender of the attacker and the witness's error could have been in either direction, we should consider both possibilities: the attacker is male, and the witness correctly identified him as such; and the attacker is female, but the witness mistakenly identified him as male.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male) and the probability that the attacker is female as P(female). Since the city is 85% female and 15% male, we have:

P(female) = 0.85
P(male) = 0.15

Given that the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male if the attacker is indeed male is:

P(witness correctly identified male|male) = 0.8

Similarly, the probability that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male if the attacker is female is:

P(witness incorrectly identified male|female) = 0.2

Given that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed female is:

P(female|witness incorrectly identified male) = P(female) / P(witness incorrectly identified male|female)
= 0.85 / 0.2
= 4.25

However, since the probability of an event cannot exceed 1, we will round this value to 4.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is:

P(male|witness's statement) = P(witness correctly identified male|male) * P(male)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

But we also know that there is a 4 times higher probability that the attacker is female, given the witness's mistaken identification. Therefore, the total probability of the attacker being male must be lower than 0.12 / 4 = 0.03.

Given the witness's accuracy and the city's gender distribution, it seems unlikely that the attacker is male. However, based solely on the provided information, we can only estimate the probability to be less than 0.03.

{probability: 0.03, explanation: The witness's accuracy and the city's gender distribution suggest that the attacker is more likely to be female. The provided information allows us to estimate the probability of the attacker being male to be less than 0.03.}
