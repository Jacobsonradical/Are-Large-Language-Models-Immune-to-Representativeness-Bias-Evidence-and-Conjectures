To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being male based on the city's population statistics:
   - The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.
   - So, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85, and the probability of the attacker being male is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

2. Next, let's consider the witness's reliability in gender identification:
   - The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
   - If the attacker is indeed male, the witness correctly identifies him as such 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies him as female 20% of the time.
   - On the other hand, if the attacker is female, the witness incorrectly identifies him as male 20% of the time (type I error), and correctly identifies him as female 80% of the time.

3. Now, let's incorporate both factors:
   - Since we don't know the attacker's gender, we need to consider both possibilities and their corresponding probabilities.
   - If the attacker is female, the probability of the witness identifying him as male is 0.2 (type I error).
   - If the attacker is male, the probability of the witness identifying him as male is 0.8.
   - Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we need to weigh these probabilities based on their corresponding error rates.
   - The weighted probability of the attacker being male is (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.29}.
