To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness would mistake a female attacker for a male:
1. The probability of picking a female from the city population is 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female).
2. Given that the witness picks a female, the probability of misidentifying her as male is 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases).

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness would correctly identify a male attacker:
1. The probability of picking a male from the city population is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).

Since the witness identifies gender correctly in 80% of the cases, the probability of correctly identifying a male attacker is:

0.1 (probability of picking a male) * 0.8 (probability of correct identification) = 0.012

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male:

probability = 0.012 (probability of correct identification) + 0.2 * 0.05 (probability of mistakenly identifying a female as male)

probability = 0.012 + 0.1 * 0.05 = 0.016

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.016, or 1.6%. However, it's important to note that this estimation relies on several assumptions, such as the witness's gender identification accuracy being consistent under all conditions, and the attacker being randomly selected from the city population. In real-world scenarios, these assumptions might not always hold true.
