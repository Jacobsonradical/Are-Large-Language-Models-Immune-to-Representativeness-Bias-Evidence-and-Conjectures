To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the population.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know the actual gender of the attacker, the witness's error can be either misidentifying a male as female or a female as male.

If we assume that the witness's error rate is evenly distributed between the two genders (which is a reasonable assumption given that the witness's total error rate is 20%), then the witness makes an error in identifying a male as female 10% of the time (20% error rate divided by 2).

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female is:

0.15 (probability of a male) * 0.10 (witness's error rate in identifying a male as female) = 0.015

Since the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male is:

0.15 (probability of a male) * (1 - 0.10 (witness's error rate in identifying a male as female)) = 0.135

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.135 or 13.5%.
