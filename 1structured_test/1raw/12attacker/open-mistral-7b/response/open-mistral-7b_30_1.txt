To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. According to the given information, 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is only 80% under similar conditions. This means the witness errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male. Since we don't know if this identification was correct, we need to consider both the possibility that the witness was correct and that the witness was incorrect.
4. If the witness was correct, then the attacker is indeed male. In this case, the probability of the attacker being male is simply the probability of the witness being correct, which is 0.8 (or 80%).
5. If the witness was incorrect, then the attacker is actually female, despite the witness's statement. In this case, the probability of the attacker being male is 0 (since the attacker is not male).
6. To find the overall probability that the attacker is male, we need to weight these two scenarios by their respective probabilities.
7. The probability of the witness being incorrect is the probability of being incorrect in gender identification, which is 0.2 (or 20%).
8. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (the probability of the witness being correct) times 1 (the consequence of the witness being correct) plus 0 (the probability of the witness being incorrect) times 0 (the consequence of the witness being incorrect), which equals 0.8.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.8, or 80%.
