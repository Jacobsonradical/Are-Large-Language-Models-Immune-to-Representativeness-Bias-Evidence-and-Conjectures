Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A times the probability of event A divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being male (denoted as M), and event B is the witness's identification of the attacker as male (denoted as W). The probability of event A (P(M)) is what we want to find.

First, we need to find the probability of event B given event A (P(W|M)), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker. The witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(W|M) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find the probability of event B given event A' (the attacker being female, denoted as F), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(W|F) = 0.2.

The probability of event A' (P(F)) is given as 15% (from information b).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem: P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)].

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the numerator and denominator, we get:

P(M|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

So, P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.41 or 41%.

Therefore, given the information provided, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.41.
