To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis (H) given the evidence (E)
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

In this case, H is the attacker being male, E is the witness's statement, P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, P(E | H) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male, and P(E) is the probability of the witness's statement (regardless of the attacker's gender).

Given the information, we can calculate P(H | E) using the following values:

- P(E | H) = 0.8 (80% probability of correct identification)
- P(H) = Unknown, but we can assume it to be 0.5 (since we have no prior information)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | not H) * (1 - P(H))
  P(E | not H) = 0.2 (20% probability of incorrect identification)
  P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
  P(E) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.6

Using these values, we can calculate P(H | E):

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.8) * (0.5) / (0.6) ≈ 0.67 (approximately 67%)

However, the information provided in point b states that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. This contradicts the assumption we made that P(H) = 0.5. If we use this new information, we can calculate a more accurate estimate for P(H):

P(H) = 0.15 (15% probability of the attacker being male)

Using these new values, we can calculate the updated probability:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.6) ≈ 0.23 (approximately 23%)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the information about the city's population, is approximately 23%.
