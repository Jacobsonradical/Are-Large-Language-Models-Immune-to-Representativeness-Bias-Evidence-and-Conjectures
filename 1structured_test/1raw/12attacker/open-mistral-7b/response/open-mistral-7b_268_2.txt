The information provided can be broken down into two parts: the distribution of gender in the city and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender.

1. The distribution of gender in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness has an accuracy of 80% in identifying gender, but errs 20% of the time.

However, there's an important distinction to make: the witness's gender identification accuracy is given in a controlled setting where the gender is clearly visible, unlike the nighttime attack scenario. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect that the witness's accuracy in identifying gender in the dark is lower than 80%.

As we don't have any information about the witness's accuracy in identifying gender in a dark or ambiguous setting, we cannot provide a definitive answer. Therefore, the estimation of the probability that the attacker is male based solely on this information is not possible.
