To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(wM) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(wF) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we can write:
P(wM) = 0.8

Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male is:
P(wF) = 0.2

We also know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. So, the probability that the attacker is female is:
P(F) = 0.85

The probability that the attacker is male is:
P(M) = 1 - P(F) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now, let's consider the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is indeed male (P(wM|M)) or female (P(wM|F)).

Given that the attacker is male:
P(wM|M) = P(M) = 0.15

Given that the attacker is female:
P(wM|F) = P(wF) = 0.2

The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male is the weighted sum of these probabilities:
P(wM) = P(wM|M) * P(M) + P(wM|F) * P(F)

Substituting the given values:
P(wM) = (0.15) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.0225 + 0.1765 = 0.2000

The witness's statement implies that the attacker is male with a probability of 0.8 (as stated by the witness). However, our calculations show that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker with a probability of 0.2. This discrepancy suggests that the witness's statement might not reflect the actual probability of the attacker being male.

Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. The witness's statement contradicts the actual probability calculated from the witness's accuracy and the city's gender distribution.
