To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. From the population data (a), we know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male.

2. From the witness data (b), we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male. This means that the witness was likely mistaken 80% of the time when the actual attacker was female.

3. Since we assume that the witness's ability to judge gender is not affected by the attacker being attacked from behind, we can use this probability of error of 20% as a correction factor for the witness's initial identification.

4. Given that the population is heavily female (85%), it is more likely that the witness made a mistake and identified a female attacker as male.

5. Therefore, to estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we subtract the probability that the witness was correct (which would imply a female attacker) from 1.

The probability that the witness was correct (a female attacker) is the probability of a female attacker times the witness's accuracy in identifying females, plus the probability of a male attacker times the witness's error in identifying males:

Probability of female attacker * Witness accuracy in identifying females + Probability of male attacker * Witness error in identifying males

= 0.85 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 1

= 0.68 + 0.15

= 0.83

Since the probability that the witness was correct (0.83) is greater than 0.5, it suggests that the witness is more likely to have mistakenly identified a female attacker as male. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is lower than 15%.

However, due to the witness's error, we cannot provide an exact probability. To be conservative, we can say that the probability that the attacker is male is less than 15%.

{probability: less than 0.15, note: due to the witness's error, a precise probability cannot be determined}
