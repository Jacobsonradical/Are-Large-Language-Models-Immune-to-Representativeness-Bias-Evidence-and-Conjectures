Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, and their error rate is 20%.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence. This is what we're trying to find.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis. This is the probability of the hypothesis before considering the evidence. Given that the population is 85% female and 15% male, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence. In this case, the witness makes a correct identification 80% of the time, so the probability of the evidence is 0.8.

Now, we can plug in the values and calculate:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.8
P(H|E) = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%. This means that given the witness's identification, there is a 12% chance that the attacker is male. It's important to note that this is not the actual probability that the attacker is male, as there may be other evidence or factors not considered in this analysis.
