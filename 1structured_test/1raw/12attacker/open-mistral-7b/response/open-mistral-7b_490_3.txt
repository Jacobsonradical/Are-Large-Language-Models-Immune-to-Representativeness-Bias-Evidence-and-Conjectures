Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given new evidence.

The theorem can be written as:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of H given E (probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification)
- P(E|H) is the probability of E given H (probability that the witness identifies a male as male, given that the attacker is male)
- P(H) is the prior probability of H (probability of the attacker being male in the population)
- P(E) is the probability of E (probability that the witness identifies a male as male, regardless of whether the attacker is male or female)

From the information provided, we know that:
- P(H) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being male in the population)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a male 20% of the time, where ~H represents the attacker being female)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) = 0.12 (using the definition of P(E))

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)
       = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / (0.12)
       = 0.6667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.67 or 67%.
