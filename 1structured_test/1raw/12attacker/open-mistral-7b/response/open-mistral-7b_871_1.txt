To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume that the witness's gender identification is independent of the gender distribution in the city. This means that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is the same as incorrectly identifying a male as female.

The probability of a female being incorrectly identified as male is 0.2 (the error rate). Given that 85% of the population is female, the number of females in the city is 0.85 * total population. So, the expected number of incorrectly identified females is 0.2 * 0.85 * total population.

Similarly, the probability of a male being incorrectly identified as female is also 0.2. Given that 15% of the population is male, the number of males in the city is 0.15 * total population. So, the expected number of incorrectly identified males is 0.2 * 0.15 * total population.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the actual number of incorrectly identified males must be equal to or greater than the actual number of males in the city. This implies that the number of incorrectly identified females must be less than the number of females in the city.

Now, we need to find the total population to ensure that the number of incorrectly identified males is greater than or equal to the actual number of males in the city. We can set up an inequality:

0.2 * 0.15 * total population ≥ 0.15 * total population

Solving for total population, we get:

total population ≥ 5

Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, the number of incorrectly identified males must be equal to the actual number of males in the city, which is 0.15 * total population. So, we can set up an equation:

0.2 * 0.15 * total population = 0.15 * total population

Solving for total population, we get:

total population = 25

Now, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is male by calculating the ratio of males to the total population:
