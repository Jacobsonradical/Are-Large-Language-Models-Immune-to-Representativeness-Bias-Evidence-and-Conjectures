To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being male, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:

- P(M) as the prior probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the prior probability that the attacker is female
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male

We are given:

1. P(w|M) = 0.8 (from the information in 'a')
2. P(w|F) = 0.2 (from the information in 'a')
3. P(M) + P(F) = 1 (since there are only two possibilities: male or female)
4. The population is 85% female and 15% male (from the information in 'b')

We want to find P(M|w), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(M|w) = P(w|M) * P(M) / (P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F))

First, we need to find P(F) using the given information:

P(F) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(M|w):

P(M|w) = (0.8) * (0.15) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.17

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.17, or 17%. This estimate is lower than the witness's initial identification because the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is not perfect, and the population is predominantly female.
