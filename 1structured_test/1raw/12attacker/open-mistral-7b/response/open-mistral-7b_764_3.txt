To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the probability of the witness making a mistake by assuming the attacker is male.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male:
P(correct male) = 0.15 (probability of male) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male (assuming the attacker is female):
P(incorrect male) = 0.85 (probability of female) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17

Since we are given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we want to find the probability of this event occurring given that the attacker is male (P(male|identified as male)) or given that the attacker is female (P(female|identified as male)).

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate these probabilities:

P(male|identified as male) = P(identified as male|male) * P(male) / (P(identified as male|male) * P(male) + P(identified as male|female) * P(female))

Let's calculate the terms in the equation:

P(identified as male|male) = 0.12 (calculated above)
P(identified as male|female) = 0.17 (calculated above)
P(male) = 0.15 (given information)
P(female) = 0.85 (given information)

Now, we can calculate P(male|identified as male):

P(male|identified as male) = (0.12 * 0.15) / ((0.12 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)) = 0.14

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.14 or 14%. This is a significantly lower probability than the gender distribution in the city, which suggests that the witness's identification may not be reliable in this case.
