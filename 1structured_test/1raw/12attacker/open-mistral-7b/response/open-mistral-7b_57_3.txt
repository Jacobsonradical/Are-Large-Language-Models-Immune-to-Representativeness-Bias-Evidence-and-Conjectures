To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the initial population statistics and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

The witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time. This means that they correctly identify gender 80% of the time. Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the witness's probability of correctly identifying a male attacker as follows:

1. The probability of picking a male from the population is 15%.
2. Given that the witness picks a male, the probability of them correctly identifying that male is 0.8 (from the statement b).

So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is:

0.15 (probability of picking a male) * 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a male) = 0.12

However, this does not take into account the witness's errors in identifying gender. Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, we need to account for the fact that they might have erroneously identified a female attacker as male, which would increase the probability of the attacker being male in the witness's report.

Let's call the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a female attacker as male "p_err". Since the witness correctly identifies a female attacker with probability 0.2, we can write the equation for the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male:

0.8 (probability of picking a female) * p_err = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male)

Solving for "p_err", we get:

p_err = 0.2 / (0.8 * 0.15) = 0.25

Now, let's consider the probability of the witness reporting a male attacker. This can happen in two ways: either they correctly identify a male attacker or they erroneously identify a female attacker as male.

The probability of the witness reporting a male attacker is:

0.15 (probability of picking a male) * 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a male) + 0.15 (probability of picking a female) * 0.25 (probability of erroneously identifying a female as male)

Calculating this, we get:

0.12 + 0.0375 = 0.1575

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's report, is approximately 15.75%.
