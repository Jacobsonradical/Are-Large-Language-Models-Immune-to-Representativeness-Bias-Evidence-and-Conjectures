To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the attacker's gender is randomly distributed in the city (as per the given information), we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male
- P(A) = Probability of attacker being male in the city, which we know is 15% (from information b)
- P(B|A) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, which is 0.8 (from information a)
- P(B|~A) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (from information a and b)
- P(~A) = Probability of attacker being female, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (from information b)
- P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying any gender as male, which is P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.207

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
      = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.207
      â‰ˆ 0.472

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 47.2%.
