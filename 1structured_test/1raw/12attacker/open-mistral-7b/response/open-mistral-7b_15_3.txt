To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence

From the information given, we have:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the gender as male 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male)
- P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)
  Where ~H denotes the opposite of H (the attacker is female), and P(E|~H) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the gender as male given that the attacker is female. Since the witness has a 20% error rate, P(E|~H) = 0.2
  Therefore, P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* (1-0.15) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is:

P(H|E) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / 0.15 = 0.12

The probability that the attacker is male is approximately 12%.
