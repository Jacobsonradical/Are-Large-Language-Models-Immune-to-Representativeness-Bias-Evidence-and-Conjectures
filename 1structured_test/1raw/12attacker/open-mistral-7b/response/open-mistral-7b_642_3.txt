Based on the provided information, we can make an estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.

The witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, and they err in 20% of the cases. However, we know that 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male. This means that there are more opportunities for the witness to incorrectly identify a male as female than to incorrectly identify a female as male.

To estimate the probability that the witness mistakenly identified a female as male, we can use the error rate provided: 20%. Since there are more females than males, this means that there are more opportunities for the witness to make this mistake.

Let's denote the number of females as F and the number of males as M. We know that F = 0.85 * total population and M = 0.15 * total population.

The probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male is therefore:

P(mistaken female) = 0.2 * (number of females) / (total population)

Since there are more opportunities for this mistake to occur, we can assume that the witness made this mistake more often than they mistakenly identified a male as female. Therefore, it is more likely that the attacker is actually female and the witness made a mistake.

However, without more information, we can't calculate an exact probability of the attacker being male. But we can say that based on the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city, it is more likely that the attacker is female.

To answer the question strictly in the dictionary format: {probability: not possible to calculate with the given information, but it is more likely that the attacker is female}
