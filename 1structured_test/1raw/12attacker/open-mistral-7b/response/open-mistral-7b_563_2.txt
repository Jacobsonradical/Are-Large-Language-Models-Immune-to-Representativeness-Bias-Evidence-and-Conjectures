Given the information provided, we have two pieces of evidence: the demographic distribution of the city and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M). Since we know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can say that P(M) + P(F) = 1, where P(F) is the probability of the attacker being female.

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is given as 80%. This means that when presented with a random person, the witness will correctly identify the gender 80% of the time and incorrectly identify it 20% of the time. However, the witness made a mistake in this specific case, identifying the attacker as male.

If we denote the probability that the witness is correct in their identification as P(M|W), then we know that P(M|W) = 0.2 (given the information provided), since the witness was wrong.

We also know that the probability of the witness being wrong when the attacker is male is 1 - P(M|W) = 0.8. This means that when the attacker is male, the witness will incorrectly identify the gender as female 80% of the time.

Since the city is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of picking a random female is 0.85 and the probability of picking a random male is 0.15.

Given that the witness is wrong, the probability of picking a female and having the witness identify the attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68. This means that there is a 68% chance that the attacker is female, given that the witness is wrong.

However, we know that the witness was wrong, so we need to find the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness is wrong. This can be calculated as P(M|W and Wrong) = P(M) / (P(M) + P(F) * P(Wrong|M)) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85 * 0.68) = 0.15 / 0.57 = 0.26.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is {probability: 0.26, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.
