Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. The witness, who is not specified as being from the population of the city, correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

However, we do not have information on whether the witness's gender perception accuracy is biased towards one gender or the other. If the witness has a bias, their 80% accuracy rate may not be an accurate reflection of the true gender distribution in the city.

Without more information, it is not possible to provide a reliable probability estimate of the attacker's gender. Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: cannot be determined, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
