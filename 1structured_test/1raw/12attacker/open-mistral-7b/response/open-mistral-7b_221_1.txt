To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, we can calculate the expected number of times the witness should correctly identify a male and the number of times they should incorrectly identify a male.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). Then, the probability that the attacker is female is P(female) = 1 - P(male).

The witness correctly identifies a male if the attacker is, in fact, male. So, the expected number of correct identifications of males is P(male) * total population.

The witness incorrectly identifies a male if the attacker is female. So, the expected number of incorrect identifications of males is P(female) * total population.

Since the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the number of correct identifications of males should be roughly 80% of the total number of males, and the number of incorrect identifications of males should be roughly 20% of the total number of females.

Now, we can set up an equation to find P(male):

0.8 * P(male) * total population = 0.8 * 0.15 * total population + 0.2 * (1 - P(male)) * total population

Solving this equation, we get:

P(male) ≈ 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - P(male)))

Simplifying this equation, we get:

P(male) ≈ 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.2 * P(male))

Now, we need to solve this equation numerically. One way to do this is to guess a value for P(male) and then iteratively improve our guess until we get a good approximation.

Let's start with a guess of P(male) = 0.2. Plugging this into the equation, we get:

P(male) ≈ 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.2 * 0.2) ≈ 0.15 / 0.25 ≈ 0.6

Our guess was too high, so let's try a lower value, say, P(male) = 0.1. Plugging this into the equation, we get:

P(male) ≈ 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.2 * 0.1) ≈ 0.15 / 0.17 ≈ 0.882

Our guess was still too low, but we're getting closer. Let's try an interpolation between our two guesses: P(male) = 0.15 / 2 * 0.2 + 0.15 / 2 * 0.6 ≈ 0.1 * 0.2 + 0.15 * 0.6 ≈ 0.12

Plugging this into the equation, we get:

P(male) ≈ 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.2 * 0.12) ≈ 0.15 / 0.18 ≈ 0.833

This is a reasonably good approximation. So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
