To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(M), and the probability that the attacker is female as P(F) = 1 - P(M).

The witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time, so the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker is 0.8, and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male attacker as female is 0.2.

Given that the population is 85% female and 15% male, the likelihood of a male attacker in the population is 0.15.

When the witness sees a male attacker, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

When the witness sees a female attacker, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (17%).

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female 20% of the time, we can set up an equation to find the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male: 0.17 = 0.2 * P(F).

Solving for P(F), we find that P(F) = 0.85.

Given that P(M) + P(F) = 1, we can find P(M): P(M) = 1 - P(F) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}.

However, it's important to note that this estimation relies on the assumption that the witness's accuracy in gender identification is independent of the actual gender of the attacker, which may not be the case. In reality, the true probability of the attacker being male might be different.
