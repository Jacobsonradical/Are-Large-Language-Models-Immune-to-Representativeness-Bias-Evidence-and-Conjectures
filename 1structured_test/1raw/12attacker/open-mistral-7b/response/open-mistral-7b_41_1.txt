To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time.
2. The city has a gender distribution of 85% female and 15% male.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, they mistakenly identify a female as male 20% of the time when they encounter a female. This means that the probability they correctly identify a male is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that this was a correct identification is 0.80, and the probability that it was a mistake is 0.20.

Since 85% of the population is female, the probability that a randomly selected individual is female is 0.85. If the witness made a mistake and identified a female as male, the actual gender of the attacker would be female.

So the probability that the witness made a mistake and the attacker is female is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17. This means that the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male and the attacker is indeed male is 0.80 * (1 - 0.17) = 0.68.

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.68} or 68%.
