To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that their identification was correct in this case 80% of the time, as per their track record. However, since we don't know whether the witness's error occurred in this case or not, we must also consider the possibility that the witness erred.

Given that 15% of the population is male, there is a 15% chance that the witness made an error by identifying a female attacker as male. In this case, the attacker is actually female, but the witness's incorrect identification leads us to believe that the attacker is male.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male under both correct and incorrect witness identification is:

Probability of attacker being male (correct identification) * Probability of correct identification + Probability of attacker being female (incorrect identification) * Probability of incorrect identification

= 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 29%.
