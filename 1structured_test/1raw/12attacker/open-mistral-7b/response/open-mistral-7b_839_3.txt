To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's reliability in identifying gender is 80% (correctly identifying gender) and 20% (making an error).
2. The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male.

However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error in identifying the attacker's gender. Let's consider two scenarios:

a) The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender:
   - In this case, the attacker is actually male (probability 0.15), and the witness correctly identified him (probability 0.8). Therefore, the probability of both events happening is (0.15) * (0.8) = 0.12.

b) The witness incorrectly identified the attacker's gender:
   - In this case, the attacker is actually female (probability 0.85), and the witness mistakenly identified him as male (probability 0.2). The probability of both events happening is (0.85) * (0.2) = 0.17.

Since we don't know which scenario is true, we must consider both and calculate their probabilities. The overall probability that the attacker is male is the sum of the probabilities in both scenarios:

{probability: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 29%.
