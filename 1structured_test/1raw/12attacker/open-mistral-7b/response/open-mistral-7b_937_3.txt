To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. If we assume that the gender distribution in the city is equal (50% male and 50% female), then the attacker's gender is independent of the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as p. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as female is then 20% * p = error_male. Similarly, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 20% * (1 - p) = error_female.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is indeed male and the witness correctly identified him. This has a probability of p.
2. The attacker is female, and the witness made an error. This has a probability of 1 - p * error_female.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the observed event is the union of these two scenarios: p + (1 - p * error_female). To find the probability of this event, we can set it equal to the probability the witness gives to a male and solve for p:

p + (1 - p * error_female) = 0.8

Substituting the values for error_male and error_female, we get:

p + (1 - p * 0.2 * (1 - 0.5)) = 0.8
p + 0.8p - 0.16p = 0.8
0.96p = 0.8
p â‰ˆ 0.082

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 8.2%.
