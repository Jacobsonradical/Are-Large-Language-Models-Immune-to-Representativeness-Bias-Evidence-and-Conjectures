Given the information provided, the attacker's gender is initially unknown to us. However, we have two pieces of information that can help us make an estimate:

1. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness identified the attacker as male, but their ability to accurately judge gender is only 80% accurate.

Let's break this down:

1. If we assume that the attacker is a random member of the city's population, the probability of the attacker being male is 15%.
2. However, the witness's identification of the attacker as male adds an extra piece of information. Since the witness's judgement of gender is not always accurate, we must account for the possibility of error.

The witness incorrectly identified a person's gender 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker was actually female, the witness would mistakenly identify them as male 20% of the time.

So, the probability of the witness misidentifying a female attacker as male is 0.20 (20%).

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker as male is 0.80 (80%).

The total probability of the witness's identification being correct, given that the attacker is male, is the probability of correct identification multiplied by the probability of the attacker being male. This is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 (12%).

Therefore, based on the witness's identification and the city's population distribution, the estimated probability of the attacker being male is 12%.
