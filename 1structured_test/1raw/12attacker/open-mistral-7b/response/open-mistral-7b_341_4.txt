Based on the information provided, the probability of the attacker being male can be estimated as follows:

1. The population is 85% female and 15% male.
2. However, the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is only 80%, meaning they err 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male.
4. Therefore, there is a 20% chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually female.
5. So, the probability that the attacker is male is 1 - the probability that the witness made an error, which is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

The estimate is {probability: 0.80} with a 80% chance that the attacker is male.
