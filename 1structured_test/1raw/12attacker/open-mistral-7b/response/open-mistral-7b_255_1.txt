Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is male
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are given the prior probability of A, which is 15% (or 0.15), and the conditional probability of E given A, which is 80% (or 0.8). We also have the prior probability of not A, which is the complement of A, or 0.85, and the conditional probability of E given not A, which is the error rate of the witness, or 20% (or 0.2).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:
P(A|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives:
P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.25

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the information and witness's accuracy, is approximately 25%.
