To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can assume that the true probability of an attacker being male is 0.15 (15%).

However, the witness's ability to accurately identify gender is not perfect. They correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases. This means that when the witness identifies someone as male, there is an 80% chance that they are correct and a 20% chance that they are wrong.

In this case, the witness identified the attacker as male. So, the probability that the witness is correct in their identification is 0.8 (80%).

To find the probability that the attacker is actually male, given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is male | witness identifies as male) = P(witness identifies as male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) / P(witness identifies as male)

Substituting the given values:

P(attacker is male | witness identifies as male) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating the values, we get:

P(attacker is male | witness identifies as male) â‰ˆ 0.195

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 19.5%.
