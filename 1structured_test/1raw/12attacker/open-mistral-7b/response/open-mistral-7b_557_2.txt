To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- p: the probability that the attacker is male
- q: the probability that the attacker is female, which is 1 - p

According to the witness's ability, when they see a person from the same gender distribution (half female and half male), they correctly identify the gender 80% of the time, meaning they correctly identify a male 0.8 * p = 0.8p times. They also incorrectly identify a male 0.2 * p = 0.2p times.

The witness saw the attacker and identified the attacker as male. This event can be either a correct identification or an incorrect one. The probability of a correct identification is 0.8p, and the probability of an incorrect identification is 0.2p. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write the following equation:

0.8p + 0.2p = 1 (the total probability of the event)

Solving for p, we get:

p = 0.5

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.5} or 50%.
