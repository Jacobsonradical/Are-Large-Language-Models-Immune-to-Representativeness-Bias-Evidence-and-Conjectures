To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of a random person being male is 0.15 (15% as a decimal).

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the witness sees a male, they correctly identify him as male 80% of the time, and when they see a female, they incorrectly identify her as male 20% of the time.

Since the witness has identified the attacker as male, we need to consider the possibility that the witness is making an error. The probability of this happening is the error rate, which is 0.20 (20% as a decimal).

However, we also need to consider that even if the witness is correct, there's still a chance that the attacker is actually female due to the city's gender distribution. The probability of this happening is the probability of the witness being correct times the probability of a random person being female, which is 0.80 (the witness's correct identification rate) * 0.15 (the probability of a random person being male).

So, the probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is the sum of these two probabilities: the probability of the witness being correct and the attacker being male, and the probability of the witness making an error and the attacker still being male.

The probability of the witness being correct and the attacker being male is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The probability of the witness making an error and the attacker still being male is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

In summary: {probability: 0.29}
