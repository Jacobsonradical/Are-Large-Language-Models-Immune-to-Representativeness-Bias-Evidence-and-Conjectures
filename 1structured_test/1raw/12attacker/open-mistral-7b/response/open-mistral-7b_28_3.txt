To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the witness's error in this case was incorrectly identifying a male as female or vice versa, we'll assume that the errors are evenly distributed (50% each).

The city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male).

Given the witness's correct identification rate, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as follows:

P(witness correctly identifies male) = P(male) * 0.8

Since the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as follows:

P(witness incorrectly identifies male as female) = P(male) * 0.2

The witness's statement implies that the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male is equal to the probability of the witness correctly identifying a female. So, we can write an equation:

P(witness correctly identifies female) = P(female) * 0.8
P(witness incorrectly identifies female as male) = P(male) * 0.2

Given that 85% of the population is female, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a female:

P(witness correctly identifies female) = 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68

Since the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is equal to the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male, we can write:

P(witness incorrectly identifies female as male) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

Now, we can rewrite the equation for the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as follows:

0.12 = P(male) * 0.2

Solving for P(male), we get:

P(male) = 0.12 / 0.2 = 0.6

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.6, or 60%.
