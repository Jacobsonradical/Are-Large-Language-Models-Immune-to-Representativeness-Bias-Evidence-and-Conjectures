Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The population distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness, while having an error rate of 20% in determining gender, identified the attacker as male.

The witness's identification of the attacker as male does not necessarily mean that the attacker is actually male, as the witness could have made an error. However, considering the population distribution, it is more likely that the attacker is female.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to account for the witness's error rate and the population distribution. Let's assume that the witness's observation of the attacker being male is correct with a probability of p. Then, the probability of the witness making an error (observing the attacker as male when the attacker is female) is 1 - p.

Given that the population distribution is 85% female and 15% male, the probability that the attacker is female is 0.85, and the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15.

Since the attacker's gender is independent of the witness's ability to identify gender, the probability that the witness makes an error (observing the attacker as male when the attacker is female) is the same for any individual in the population. Therefore, we can use the population distribution to calculate the probability of the witness making an error:

P(witness makes an error) = P(attacker is female) * P(witness incorrectly identifies attacker as male | attacker is female)
                                            = 0.85 * 0.20
                                            = 0.17

Since the witness did not make an error (he identified the attacker as male), the actual probability that the attacker is male must be greater than 0.17. However, we cannot directly calculate this probability without more information.

To provide a strict answer in the requested dictionary format, let me give you a range of possibilities:

{probability: [0.17, 1], please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This range represents the fact that the actual probability that the attacker is male is greater than 0.17, but we cannot determine an exact value without more information.
