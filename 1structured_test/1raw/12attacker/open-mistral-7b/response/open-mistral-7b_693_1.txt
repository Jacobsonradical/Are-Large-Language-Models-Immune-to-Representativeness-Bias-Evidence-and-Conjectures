To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the relationship between prior knowledge and new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's gender identification, and the prior knowledge is the gender distribution in the city.

First, let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female
- P(w|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male
- P(w|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male
- P(M|w) as the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified a male

Given that P(F) = 0.15 and P(M) + P(F) = 1, we can find P(M) = 0.85.

From the information provided, we know that P(w|M) = 0.8 and P(w|F) = 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(M|w):

P(M|w) = [P(w|M) * P(M)] / [P(w|M) * P(M) + P(w|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values from above:

P(M|w) = (0.8 * 0.85) / [(0.8 * 0.85) + (0.2 * 0.15)]

Calculating:

P(M|w) = 0.68

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.68 or 68%.
