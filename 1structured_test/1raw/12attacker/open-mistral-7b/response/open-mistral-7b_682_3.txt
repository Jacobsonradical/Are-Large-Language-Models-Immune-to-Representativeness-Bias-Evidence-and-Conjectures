Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, we are interested in P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is male (event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as male (evidence B).

We are given:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time)
2. P(A) = 0.15 (the population proportion of males is 15%)
3. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|Not A) * P(Not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.25 (the probability that the witness would identify an attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
            = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.25
            = 0.32

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
