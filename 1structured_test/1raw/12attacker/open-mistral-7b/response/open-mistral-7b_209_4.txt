Given the information provided, we can approach this problem by using Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs about a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

From the first piece of information, we know the witness's accuracy in gender identification (P(H|E) = 0.8, P(~H|E) = 0.2), and from the second piece of information, we know the prior probability of the attacker being male in the population (P(H) = 0.15).

We want to find P(H|E, data), which is the updated probability of the attacker being male given the new evidence and the data about the city's gender distribution.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E, data) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

From the first piece of information, we have P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0, and from the second piece of information, we have P(H) = 0.15, P(~H) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E, data) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85]

P(H|E, data) = 0.12

So, given the new evidence and the data about the city's gender distribution, the probability that the attacker is male is estimated to be 0.12 or 12%.
