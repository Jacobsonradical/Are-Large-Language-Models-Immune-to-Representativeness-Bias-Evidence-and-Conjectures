To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, the event is the attacker being male, and we have prior knowledge about the gender distribution in the city and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

Bayes' theorem is written as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B

Let:
- A be the event "attacker is male"
- B be the event "witness identifies attacker as male"

From the information given, we have:

P(A|B) is the probability we are interested in (estimate of the probability that the attacker is male)
P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, which is given as 0.8 (80%)
P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male. Since we don't have this information directly, we can use the city's gender distribution as an approximation: 15% of the population is male, so P(A) = 0.15
P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies any person as male, which can be calculated using the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the city's gender distribution:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, which is the complement of P(B|A), or 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is female, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 = 0.5714

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.57 or 57%.
