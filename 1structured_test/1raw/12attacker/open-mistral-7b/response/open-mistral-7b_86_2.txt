Given the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80%, while making an error is 20%. However, the witness's bias towards identifying males was not specified in the information.

If we assume that the witness has no bias (which is not necessarily the case), then the probability that the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as male would be the same as the probability of the attacker being male in the population. Given that 15% of the population is male, the probability of the attacker being male would be 0.15.

However, if we consider the possibility of a bias, then the probability might be different. Since the witness's accuracy in identifying gender is only 80%, and they identified the attacker as male, there is a 20% chance that the attacker is actually female and the witness made an error. In this case, the probability of the attacker being male would be lower than 0.15.

Without more specific information about the witness's bias, it is not possible to provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. Therefore, I would suggest conducting further investigation to determine the witness's potential bias before making a definitive judgment.

{probability: Unable to provide a precise number due to lack of sufficient information about the witness's bias, please consider further investigation}
