To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population data and the witness's reliability in gender identification.

1. From the population data (a), we know that 85% of the people in the city are female, and 15% are male.
2. The witness's reliability in gender identification (b) is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that there is a possibility that the witness made an error in their identification. However, we also need to consider the fact that the attacker could indeed be male, given the population data.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being male as P(male), and the probability of the witness making a mistake as P(error).

We have two pieces of information:

1. P(male) + P(error) = 0.15 (given the population data)
2. P(male) * P(correct) + P(error) * P(incorrect) = 0.1 (given the witness's performance)

We can simplify the second equation by substituting the values for P(correct) and P(incorrect) from the witness's performance:

P(male) * 0.8 + P(error) * 0.2 = 0.1

We can now solve this equation for P(male). By substituting the value of P(error) from the first equation, we get:

P(male) * 0.8 + (1 - P(male)) * 0.2 = 0.1

Simplifying, we get:

0.8P(male) - 0.2P(male) = 0.1

0.6P(male) = 0.1

P(male) â‰ˆ 0.1667

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is approximately 16.67%. However, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the witness's gender identification ability is consistent in all conditions, which may not always be the case.
