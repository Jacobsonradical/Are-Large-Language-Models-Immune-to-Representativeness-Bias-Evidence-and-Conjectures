To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

In this case,
- H is the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E is the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as male
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (before considering the evidence)
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male
- P(E) is the probability of the witness making the observation (identifying someone as male)

We are given the following information:
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
- P(H) = ? (the prior probability of the attacker being male)
- P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H) (where ~H is the hypothesis that the attacker is female)

We are also given that P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time) and P(~H) = 0.5 (since 85% of the population is female, the prior probability of the attacker being female is 0.5).

Substituting these values into the equation for P(E), we get:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.6

Now, we can substitute these values into the equation for Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.5] / 0.6 = 0.4

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.4, or 40%.
