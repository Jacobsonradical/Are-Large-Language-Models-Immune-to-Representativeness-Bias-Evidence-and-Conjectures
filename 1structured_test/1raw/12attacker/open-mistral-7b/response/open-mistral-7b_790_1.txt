To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's accuracy in gender identification is 80%.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's denote F as the probability of the attacker being female and M as the probability of the attacker being male. We know that F + M = 1, and we want to find M.

The witness identified the attacker as male with a probability of M. However, since the witness's accuracy is only 80%, they were likely mistaken 20% of the time when they should have identified a female attacker. This means that the probability of the witness misidentifying a female attacker as male is 0.2 * F.

Since the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, the probability of this event is M. Therefore, we can write the equation:

M = P(witness identified attacker as male) = P(attacker is male) * P(witness correctly identifies male) + P(attacker is female) * P(witness mistakenly identifies female as male)

Substituting the given values, we get:

M = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2
M ≈ 0.12 + 0.17
M ≈ 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
