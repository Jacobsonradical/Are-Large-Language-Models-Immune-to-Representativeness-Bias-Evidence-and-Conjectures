To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is "the attacker is male," and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence (witness's identification)
- P(H): prior probability of the attacker being male (before the witness's identification)
- P(E|H): likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male
- P(E|~H): likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male
- P(~H): prior probability of the attacker not being male (before the witness's identification)

From the provided information, we know that:
1. P(E|H) = 0.8 (given in the text)
2. P(E|~H) = 0.2 (given in the text)
3. P(H) + P(~H) = 1 (the attacker must be either male or not male)
4. P(H) = population of male attackers / total population
   Since 85% of the population is female, the population of male attackers is 15% of the total population.

So, P(H) = 0.15

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculate the result to get the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.
