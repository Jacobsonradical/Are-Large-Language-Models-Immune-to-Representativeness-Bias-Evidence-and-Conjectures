Given the information provided, there are two sources of information about the attacker's gender: the population statistics and the witness's testimony.

1. According to the population statistics, the probability that the attacker is male is 15%. This is based on the assumption that the attacker is randomly selected from the city's population.

2. The witness's testimony suggests a different probability. Since the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability that the witness's gender identification was incorrect as 0.20 (or 20%). This means that the witness's gender identification was likely correct 80% of the time. However, since the witness identified the attacker as male, this means that the attacker was likely female 20% of the time (given that the witness's gender identification was incorrect).

Given this, the probability that the witness's gender identification was correct and the attacker is indeed male is 0.80 (or 80%). Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, based on both the population statistics and the witness's testimony, is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.15 (population statistics) + 0.80 * 0.80 (witness's testimony) = 0.15 + 0.64 = 0.79 or 79%.

However, it's important to note that this estimation is based on several assumptions, such as the attacker being randomly selected from the city's population and the witness's ability to accurately identify gender being consistent with their performance in the sample provided. In real-world situations, these assumptions may not hold, and the actual probability could be different. Therefore, this estimation should be considered as an approximation and not as the definitive probability.
