Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness identified the attacker as male, but their gender identification accuracy is only 80% under similar night conditions, with a 20% error rate.

Since we don't have any independent evidence to favor the witness's identification over the city's demographic information, we should consider both sources of information when estimating the attacker's gender.

To do this, we can calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as male and then subtract it from 1 to get our estimate:

1. The probability of the attacker being male given the city's demographics is 15%.
2. The probability of the witness making an error and incorrectly identifying a female as male is 20%.
3. Since the attacker's gender is unknown, we should consider both possibilities (attacker is female and witness is wrong, and attacker is male and witness is correct).
4. Given that the city is 85% female, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85.
5. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is 0.20.
6. The probability of the attacker being female and the witness being wrong is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17.
7. The probability of estimating the attacker's gender based on the witness's identification is 0.17 + 0.15 = 0.32 (the attacker is male and the witness is correct, plus the attacker is female and the witness is wrong).
8. The probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification and the city's demographics is the probability of the witness being correct, which is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12.
9. To find the overall probability of the attacker being male, we should weight the two sources of information by their reliability. Since we don't have enough information to quantify the reliability of the witness's gender identification under these specific night conditions, we'll assume their reliability to be equal to the city's demographic information.
10. The final estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is the weighted average of the two probabilities: (0.15 / (0.15 + 0.12)) * 0.15 + (0.12 / (0.15 + 0.12)) * 0.12 = 0.146.

{probability: 0.146}

In summary, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 14.6%.
