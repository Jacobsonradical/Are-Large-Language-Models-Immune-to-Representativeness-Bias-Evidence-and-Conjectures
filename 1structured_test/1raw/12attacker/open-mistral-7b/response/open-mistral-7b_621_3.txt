Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data that can help us estimate the probability that the attacker is male:

1. The witness's ability to correctly identify gender: The witness was able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time and erroneously identified gender 20% of the time.

2. The gender distribution in the city: The city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula used in probability theory to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male if the attacker is male (P(E|H)) is 0.8 (80%), and the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male if the attacker is male (P(not E|H)) is 0.2 (20%).

Similarly, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male if the attacker is female (P(E|not H)) is 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (3%), and the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male if the attacker is female (P(not E|not H)) is 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68 (68%).

Now, we can calculate the probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E (P(H|E)):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15%)
- P(not H) = 0.85 (85%)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (80%)
- P(not E|H) = 0.2 (20%)
- P(E|not H) = 0.03 (3%)
- P(not E|not H) = 0.68 (68%)

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.03 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.142 = 0.843

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.843 (or 84.3%).
