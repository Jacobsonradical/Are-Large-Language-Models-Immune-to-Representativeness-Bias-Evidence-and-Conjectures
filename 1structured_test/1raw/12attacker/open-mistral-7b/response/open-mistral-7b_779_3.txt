Based on the information provided, the witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80% (correctly identifying males 80% of the time), and they make an error 20% of the time. Since we don't have specific information about the gender distribution of the people the witness encountered in the sample, we cannot directly apply this percentage to the attacker's case.

However, we do know that 85% of the population in the city is female. This information suggests that the attacker is more likely to be female than male, as the majority of the population is female.

Given this information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male, assuming that the witness's gender judgment is independent of the attacker's gender.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the witness's gender judgment that the attacker is male.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which we know is 0.8.
P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which we don't know but can estimate based on the population statistics.
P(B) is the probability of the witness making the gender judgment that the attacker is male, which is the sum of P(B|A) and P(B|not A) (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male).

We don't have enough information about P(B|not A) to calculate it directly, but we can use the fact that the witness is correct 80% of the time to infer that they must be incorrect 20% of the time. So, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))

Now, we can solve for P(A):

P(A) = (P(B) - 0.2) / 0.6

P(B) = 0.85 (the proportion of males in the population) * P(A) + 0.15 * (1 - P(A))

We can substitute the first equation for P(A) into the second equation and solve for P(A):

0.85 * P(A) + 0.15 * (1 - P(A)) = P(B)
0.85 * P(A) + 0.15 = 0.85 * P(A) + 0.15 * P(A) + 0.05
0.7 * P(A) = 0.05
P(A) = 0.05 / 0.7

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.0714 or 7.14%. This is a significantly lower probability than the 80% stated by the witness, suggesting that the witness may have been mistaken. However, it's important to note that this calculation is based on certain assumptions and may not reflect the true probability in this specific case.
