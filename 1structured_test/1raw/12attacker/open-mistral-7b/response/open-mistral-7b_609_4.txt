Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population demographics and the witness's testimony.

1. From the population demographics, we know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male.
2. The witness, who is not identified as reliable or biased, correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. However, this witness misidentified the attacker as male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both sources of evidence. Since we don't know the reliability of the witness in this specific case, we should consider the witness's evidence as adding some uncertainty to the population demographics.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being male as P_m and the probability of the witness erring as P_w = 0.2.

Given the population demographics, we know that P_m = 0.15. However, the witness's testimony introduces some uncertainty into this estimate. Without knowing the actual error rate of the witness in this specific case, we can only provide a probability range for P_m.

Since the witness erred in this case, we can assume that P_m <= 0.2 + 0.15 * (1 - P_w) = 0.2 + 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.23. This means that the probability that the attacker is male is less than 23%.

However, we can also consider the possibility that the witness was correct, even though he had a 20% error rate. In this case, P_m >= 0.8.

Therefore, based on the provided information, we can only estimate a range for the probability that the attacker is male, which is between 0.23 and 1.
