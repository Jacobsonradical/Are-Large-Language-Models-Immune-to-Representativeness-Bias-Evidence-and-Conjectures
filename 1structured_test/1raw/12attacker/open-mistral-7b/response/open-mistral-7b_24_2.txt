Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events:

A: Attacker is male
B: Witness identifies attacker as male

We are given two probabilities:

1. P(A) = Probability of the attacker being male in the population = 0.15
2. P(B|A) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker = 0.8
3. P(B|~A) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male = 0.2

To calculate P(A|B), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculation:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.165/[0.165 + 0.17]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.165/0.335
P(A|B) ≈ 0.492

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.492 or 49.2%. This is a revised estimate, taking into account the witness's accuracy in identifying gender.
