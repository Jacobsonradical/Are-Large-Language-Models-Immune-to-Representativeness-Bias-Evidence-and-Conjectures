Given the two pieces of information, we first need to understand their implications.

1. The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. This means that a random person on the street has a higher probability of being female.

2. A witness identified the attacker as male, but their ability to accurately identify gender is only 80% correct, with a 20% error rate.

3. The witness's error rate is not specified to be biased towards misidentifying males as females or vice versa. Therefore, we can assume that the error rate is equally distributed between the two genders.

4. Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the witness was correct in their identification is 80%. However, the fact that the attacker went unnoticed as female by the majority population (85%) suggests that the attacker might not be typical in appearance.

Given the complexity of these factors, it's challenging to provide a precise probability estimate. However, based on the provided information, we can say that the attacker is more likely male than female due to the city's population distribution, but the witness's error rate reduces the certainty of this assumption. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male might be slightly higher than 80%, but it's not as high as 85%, the city's male population percentage.

{probability: approximately 0.82, but this is an estimate with a significant degree of uncertainty}
