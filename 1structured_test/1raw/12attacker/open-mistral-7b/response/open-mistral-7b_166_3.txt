Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data:

1. A witness, who is able to correctly identify gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, identified the attacker as male.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, the event is that the attacker is male, and the condition is the witness's gender identification.

Bayes' theorem is typically written as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified as male)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (probability that the witness identifies a male as male)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (probability of the attacker being male before considering the witness's identification)
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (probability of the witness identifying a person as male)

We have the values for P(B|A) and P(A) from the information provided. We can calculate P(B) by using the total population information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability)
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.12 (calculated value)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 = 0.75

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.75 or 75%.
