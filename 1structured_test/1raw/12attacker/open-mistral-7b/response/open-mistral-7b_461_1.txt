To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the initial population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. Initial population distribution: The perpetrator could be either male or female, and the population in this city is 85% female and 15% male.

2. Witness's accuracy in gender identification: The witness was found to be 80% accurate in identifying gender and made errors 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possibilities:

a) The attacker is actually male, and the witness correctly identified the gender.
b) The attacker is female, and the witness incorrectly identified the gender.

Based on the given data, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8, and the probability of the witness making an error (misidentifying a female as male) is 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male (given this information) by considering both possibilities and accounting for their probabilities:

P(attacker is male | witness's statement) = P(witness correctly identified a male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness made an error) * P(attacker is female)

Using the given data, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

P(witness correctly identified a male) = 0.8
P(attacker is male) = 0.15 (since the population is 15% male)
P(witness made an error) = 0.2
P(attacker is female) = 0.85 (since the population is 85% female)

So,

P(attacker is male | witness's statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
