Given the information provided, we have two pieces of data to consider:

1. The witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80%, with an error rate of 20%.
2. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Now, let's apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equivalent to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B. In this case:

A: Attacker is male
B: Witness identified attacker as male

The prior probability of the attacker being male (P(A)) is given by the city's gender distribution: P(A) = 0.15

The probability of the witness identifying a male as male, given that the attacker is indeed male (P(B|A)) is given by the witness's ability to correctly identify gender: P(B|A) = 0.8

The probability of the witness identifying a female as male, given that the attacker is female (P(B|not A)) is the error rate: P(B|not A) = 0.2

The probability of the witness identifying a female as male (P(not A|B)) can be found using Bayes' theorem with A replaced by not A:

P(not A|B) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) / P(B)

Substituting the known values:

P(not A|B) = 0.2 * 0.85 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the known values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.12, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
