To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's probability of correctly identifying a male and the gender distribution in the city.

Given the witness's ability to judge gender, they correctly identify males 80% of the time. The gender distribution in the city is 15% male and 85% female.

If we assume that the witness has no bias towards or against identifying males or females, the probability that they correctly identify the attacker as male should be the same as the percentage of males in the city. However, due to the witness's error rate, we need to adjust this probability.

The probability of the witness erring in identifying the attacker as male is the probability of the witness erring in general, which is the error rate of 20%.

So, the probability of the attacker being male is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male plus the probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as male (which is the opposite of the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as female).

Let P(male) be the probability that the attacker is male. Then,

P(male) = P(witness correctly identifies male) + P(witness errs, identifies male)

P(witness correctly identifies male) = 0.8 (the witness's correct rate) * 0.15 (the percentage of males) = 0.12

P(witness errs, identifies male) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate) * 0.85 (the percentage of females) = 0.17

So, P(male) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%.
