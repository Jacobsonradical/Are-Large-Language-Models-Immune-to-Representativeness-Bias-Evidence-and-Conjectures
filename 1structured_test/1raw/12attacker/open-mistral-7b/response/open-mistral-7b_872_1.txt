To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given new evidence (the witness's identification).

The formula is: P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence). In this case, it's the percentage of males in the city.
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the witness's identification).
- P(H|E) is the updated probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.

Let's break it down:
1. P(H): 15% (since 15% of the population is male)
2. P(E|H): 80% (since the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time when they were presented with a male)
3. P(E|~H): 20% (since the witness incorrectly identified the gender 20% of the time when they were presented with a female)

Now, we need to find P(E) which is the probability of the witness making the identification "male" regardless of the actual gender of the attacker. To do this, we can use the formula for the sum of probabilities:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

Since P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

P(H|E) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29] = 0.3448

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.3448 or 34.48%.
