To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't know if the witness made a correct identification or an error, we can't directly use the 80% or 20% numbers. Instead, we should consider both possibilities and their corresponding probabilities.

1. If the witness made a correct identification, then the attacker is indeed male. The probability of this event is the witness's success rate in gender identification, which is 0.8.

2. If the witness made an error, then the attacker should be considered female according to their statement, but we know that 85% of the population in the city is female. So, if the witness made an error, the probability of the attacker being male is the opposite of the city's gender distribution, which is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Given that we don't know which scenario happened, we should consider both possibilities and their probabilities. The probability of the attacker being male is the sum of these two probabilities, weighted by their respective probabilities of occurring:

Probability of attacker being male = (Probability of correct identification * Probability of correct identification being true) + (Probability of error * Probability of error being true)

Probability of correct identification being true = 0.8
Probability of error being true = 0.15

Probability of attacker being male = (0.8 * 0.8) + (0.15 * 0.15) = 0.64 + 0.0225 = 0.6625

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.66 or 66%.
