Given the information provided, the attacker's gender was originally unknown to the victim. However, a witness later identified the attacker as male. The reliability of the witness's gender identification is given as 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

Given that the population of the city is 85% female and 15% male, it would seem that the attacker is more likely to be female. However, the witness's identification contradicts this, suggesting that the attacker is more likely male.

The probability of the witness's identification being correct is 0.8, or 80%. Therefore, given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.8.

In summary:
{probability: 0.8}
