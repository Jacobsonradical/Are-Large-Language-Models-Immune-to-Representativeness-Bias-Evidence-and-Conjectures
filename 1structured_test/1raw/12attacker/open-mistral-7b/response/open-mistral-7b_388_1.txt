To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possibilities:

a) The attacker is indeed male, and the witness correctly identified him.
b) The attacker is female, and the witness incorrectly identified him as male.

The probability of option a is the probability of the attacker being male (15%) multiplied by the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male (0.8).

The probability of option b is the probability of the attacker being female (1 - 0.85 = 0.15) multiplied by the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male (0.2).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker being male is the sum of the probabilities of both options a and b, weighted by the likelihood of each option:

P(attacker is male) = P(attacker is male and witness is correct) + P(attacker is female and witness is incorrect)
= (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.15 * 0.2)
= 0.12 + 0.003
= 0.123

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.123 or 12.3%.
