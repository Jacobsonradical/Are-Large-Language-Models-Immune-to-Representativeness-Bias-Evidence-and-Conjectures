To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can consider two scenarios:
1. The witness's gender judgment is perfectly reliable (100% accurate). In this case, since the witness identified the attacker as male, the attacker must be male.
2. The witness's gender judgment is not perfectly reliable. In this case, we should consider the actual gender distribution in the city and the witness's error rate.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, and the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we can compute the probability of the witness making a mistake when identifying a male attacker.

The probability of the witness identifying a male as female is the error rate for males, which is 20% times the proportion of males in the population, or 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 (3%).

So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97 (97%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is male, given this information, is the probability of the witness making a correct identification, which is 0.97.
