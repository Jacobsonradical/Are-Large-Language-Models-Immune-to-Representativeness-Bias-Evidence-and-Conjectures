Given the information provided, let's break it down:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying gender and errs 20% of the time identified the attacker as male.

The witness's statement introduces a level of uncertainty. If we were to assume that the witness was perfectly accurate, we could simply use the population statistics to estimate the probability. However, with the witness's accuracy rate, we need to account for this error.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can calculate the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a female as male and mistake her for the attacker. Since 85% of the population is female, this probability is:

0.2 (error rate) * 0.85 (probability of the attacker being female) = 0.1765 or 17.65%

Now, we can subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that the witness was correct:

1 - 0.1765 = 0.8235 or 82.35%

However, since the witness identified the attacker as male, we want to know the probability that the attacker is actually male, given that the witness's identification was correct. To find this probability, we can divide the probability that the attacker is male by the total probability of the witness being correct:

0.15 (probability of the attacker being male) / 0.8235 (total probability of the witness being correct) = 0.1828 or 18.28%

So, given the witness's 80% accuracy rate, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 18.28%.
