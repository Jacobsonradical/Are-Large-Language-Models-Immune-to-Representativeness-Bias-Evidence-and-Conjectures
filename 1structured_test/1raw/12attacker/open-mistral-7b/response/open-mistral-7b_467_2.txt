To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) given evidence (the witness's statement and the city's demographics).

Let's denote:

- A as the event that the attacker is male
- E1 as the event that the witness identifies someone as male
- E2 as the event that 85% of the population is female

According to the given information, we know:

P(A) = Probability of the attacker being male (we want to find this)
P(E1|A) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, given that the attacker is male (given in the first piece of information)
P(E1|~A) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male, given that the attacker is female (1 - P(E1|A))
P(E2) = Probability of 85% of the population being female (given in the second piece of information)

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|E1):

P(A|E1) = [P(E1|A) * P(A)] / [P(E1|A) * P(A) + P(E1|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values given:

P(A|E1) = [0.8 * P(A)] / [0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * (1 - P(A))]

Since we want an estimate for P(A|E1), we can substitute P(A) with the probability of an attacker being male in the general population. Given that 15% of the population is male, P(A) = 0.15.

Therefore,

P(A|E1) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating the above expression gives us:

P(A|E1) â‰ˆ 0.21

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the city's demographics, is approximately 0.21 or 21%.
