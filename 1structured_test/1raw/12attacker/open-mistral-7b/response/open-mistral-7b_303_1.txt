To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness's reliability in identifying gender is 80%.
2. The gender distribution in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's assume that the gender distribution is independent of the witness's ability to identify gender. In other words, the witness's accuracy rate of 80% applies to both males and females.

When the witness identifies a person as male, there are two possibilities:

a) The person is truly male (a true positive).
b) The person is female, but the witness makes an error and incorrectly identifies her as male (a false positive).

Similarly, when the witness identifies a person as female, there are two possibilities:

a) The person is truly female (a true negative).
b) The person is male, but the witness makes an error and incorrectly identifies him as female (a false negative).

Let's calculate the probability of a true positive (P(TP)) and the probability of a false positive (P(FP)).

P(TP) = Probability of a male in the city * Witness's accuracy rate for male (85% * 0.8 = 0.71)
P(FP) = Probability of a female in the city * Witness's error rate for female (15% * 0.2 = 0.03)

Now, let's calculate the probability of a false negative (P(FN)).

P(FN) = Probability of a male in the city * Witness's error rate for male (15% * 0.2 = 0.03)

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the probability of a true positive (P(TP)) or a false positive (P(FP)).

The probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement is the sum of P(TP) and P(FP):

P(Attacker is Male | Witness Statement) = P(TP) + P(FP)
                                                      = 0.71 + 0.03
                                                      = 0.74

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and assuming independent gender distribution and witness reliability, is 0.74 (or 74%).
