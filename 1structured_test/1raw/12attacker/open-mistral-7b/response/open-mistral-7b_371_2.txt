Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female and 15% is male (statement "a").
2. However, we also have information about the witness's accuracy in identifying gender (statement "b"). The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The witness identified the attacker as male. Since the witness is not perfect, there's a chance that the witness made an error.
4. To estimate the probability that the attacker is actually male, we need to consider both the city's demographics and the witness's error rate.
5. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as "p". Then, the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker is p.
6. The probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female as male is (1 - p) * 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time in identifying females as males).
7. Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the likelihood of this event occurring due to a correct identification by the witness is p.
8. On the other hand, the likelihood of this event occurring due to the witness's error is (1 - p) * 0.2.
9. The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is the sum of these two probabilities: p + (1 - p) * 0.2.
10. The witness actually identified the attacker as male. Therefore, the observed data fits better with the scenario where the attacker is actually male and the witness correctly identified him as such (p) than the scenario where the attacker is female and the witness made an error (1 - p) * 0.2.
11. To maximize the likelihood of the observed data, we want to find the value of p that makes p + (1 - p) * 0.2 as large as possible. This occurs when p is close to 1.
12. Considering the city's demographics, it seems unrealistic to assume that the attacker is almost certainly male (p close to 1). Therefore, we should find a value of p that balances the city's demographics and the witness's error rate.
13. One possible estimate for p is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, which is 0.8 (from statement "b"). However, this estimate might be too optimistic given the city's demographics.
14. A more reasonable estimate for p could be the ratio of the witness's success rate in identifying males to the city's male population ratio: 0.8 / (0.15 / 0.85) = 0.64.

Answer: {probability: 0.64}
