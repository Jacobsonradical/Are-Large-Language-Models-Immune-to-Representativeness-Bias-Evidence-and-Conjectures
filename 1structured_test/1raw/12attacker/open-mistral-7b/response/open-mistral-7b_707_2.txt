Given the information provided, the witness's reliability in identifying gender is 80% correct and 20% incorrect. However, the witness made an error in identifying the attacker as male. This means that there is a 20% chance that the witness was incorrect and the actual gender of the attacker is different from what the witness reported.

Since the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, if the witness was incorrect, it is more likely that the attacker is female. Therefore, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male by subtracting the probability of the attacker being female, given the witness's error, from 1.

The probability of a random person in the city being male is 0.15. If the witness was incorrect, the probability of the attacker being male is higher than 0.15, but lower than 1.

The probability of the witness being incorrect and the attacker being female is therefore 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's error, is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.

However, this is not the final answer because we do not know the actual gender of the attacker. The witness could have been correct, in which case the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

To get a more accurate estimate, we can weight the two probabilities by their likelihoods. The likelihood of the witness being correct is (1 - 0.20) = 0.80, and the likelihood of the witness being incorrect is 0.20.

Therefore, the final estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 * 0.20 + 0.83 * 0.80 = 0.25 * 0.20 + 0.664 * 0.80 = 0.10 + 0.5312 = 0.6312 or approximately 63.12%.
