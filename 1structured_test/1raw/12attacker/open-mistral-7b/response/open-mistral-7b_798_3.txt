To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the population.

1. From the provided information, we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. We also know that 85% of the population in the city is female and 15% is male.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 (the witness's success rate).
2. Given that 15% of the population is male, the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15%).
3. Since the witness is not perfect, we need to account for the times when the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male. The probability of this happening is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).
4. However, since there are more females in the population, there are more opportunities for the witness to make this kind of mistake. The ratio of females to males in the population is 85:15, or 5.67:1. Therefore, for every 6 cases where the witness identifies a female as male, there is 1 actual male.
5. To find the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male when the actual attacker is male, we can multiply the witness's error rate by the ratio of false positives to true positives: 0.2 * (6/7) = 0.243 (approximately 24.3%)
6. Since 75.7% of the time the witness correctly identifies a female as female (100% - 24.3%), there is a 75.7% chance that the witness is identifying a female when the actual attacker is female.
7. Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability that the witness is identifying a female is 0.85 (85%).
8. Since we know that there are 5.67 females for every male in the population, the probability that the witness is identifying a female when the actual attacker is male is 0.85 * 5.67 = 0.474 (approximately 47.4%).
9. To find the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, we can subtract the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male when the actual attacker is male from the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male: 0.8 - 0.243 = 0.557 (approximately 55.7%)
10. Finally, to find the probability that the attacker is male, we can multiply the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker by the actual probability of the attacker being male: 0.557 * 0.15 = 0.0836 (approximately 8.4%)

Therefore, based on the witness's ability to judge gender and the gender distribution in the population, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 8.4%.
