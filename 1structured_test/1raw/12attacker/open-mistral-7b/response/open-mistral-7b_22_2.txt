Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that updates the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]

Where:
- H is the hypothesis (attacker is male),
- E is the evidence (witness's identification),
- P(H | E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence,
- P(E | H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis,
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis,
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence.

We are given:
- P(E | H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time when the person is male)
- P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female, so 15% is male)
- P(E) = P(E | H) * P(H) + P(E | ~H) * P(~H) (the sum of probabilities of the evidence given the hypothesis and given the opposite hypothesis, where ~H means the attacker is female)

We are not given the value of P(E | ~H) (the probability of the witness correctly identifying the gender 80% of the time when the person is female), but since the witness's ability to judge gender is the same for both male and female, we can assume that P(E | ~H) = 0.8 as well.

So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.84

Now we can calculate the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence:

P(H | E) = [P(E | H) * P(H)] / [P(E)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.84
= 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%. This is a significantly lower probability than the 80% accuracy of the witness, indicating that the witness's ability to judge gender is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the attacker is male with a high probability.
