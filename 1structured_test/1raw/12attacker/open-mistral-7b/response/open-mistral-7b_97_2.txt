Given the information provided, there are two sources of evidence to consider: the general population statistics and the witness's gender identification accuracy.

1. The general population statistics suggest that the attacker is likely female, given that 85% of the city's population is female. This means the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85.

2. However, the witness's gender identification accuracy indicates that there is a 20% chance of error. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this suggests that there's a 20% chance that the witness was incorrect and the actual gender of the attacker is female.

To account for both pieces of information, we can consider the witness's error rate as an additional uncertainty. In other words, even if the attacker is actually female, there's a 20% chance that the witness mistakenly identified the attacker as male.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually male, given the witness's identification, is the error rate: {probability: 0.2}

However, this interpretation assumes that the attacker's gender is independent of the witness's ability to identify gender. If there is an underlying bias in the witness's ability to identify male attackers, this estimate may not be accurate. Without more information, it's difficult to quantify this potential bias.
