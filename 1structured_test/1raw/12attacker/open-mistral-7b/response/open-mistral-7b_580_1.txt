To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being male as P(male). We know that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, so P(male) = 0.15.

The witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time, and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that when the witness saw a male, they correctly identified him as male 80% of the time, and when they saw a female, they incorrectly identified her as male 20% of the time.

The witness identified the attacker as male, so we can consider this as a successful identification. However, we need to account for the possibility that the witness was mistaken. The probability that the witness was mistaken is 20%, given that the attacker is actually male.

Given these probabilities, the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker can be calculated as follows:

P(Witness saw a male and correctly identified) = P(Attacker is male) * P(Witness correctly identifies a male) + P(Attacker is not male) * P(Witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

P(Witness saw a male and correctly identified) = 0.15 * 0.8 + (1 - 0.15) * 0.2
P(Witness saw a male and correctly identified) ≈ 0.12 + 0.12 * 0.15
P(Witness saw a male and correctly identified) ≈ 0.162

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 16.2%.

So, in the given dictionary format:
{probability: 0.162}
