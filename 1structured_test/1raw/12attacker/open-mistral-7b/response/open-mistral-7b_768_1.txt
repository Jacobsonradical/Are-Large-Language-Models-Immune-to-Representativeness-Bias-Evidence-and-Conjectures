To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given and make an assumption about the attacker's gender being independent of the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

Let's break down the information:
1. According to the witness, the probability of correctly identifying a male is 0.8 (or 80%).
2. The probability of incorrectly identifying a male is then 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (or 20%).
3. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Assuming that the attacker's gender is randomly selected from the city's population, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's gender identification. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A | B) is the probability of event A given event B
- P(B | A) is the probability of event B given event A
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B

In this case:
- A is the attacker being male
- B is the witness identifying the attacker as male
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (which we want to find)
- P(B | A) is the probability of the witness identifying a male as male (given by the witness's ability to identify gender)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying any person as male (which is the sum of P(B | A) and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is:

P(B | ¬A) = 0.2 (given by the witness's ability to identify gender)

So, the probability of the witness identifying any person as male is:

P(B) = P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | ¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.1775
P(B) = 0.2975

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's gender identification:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A | B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / 0.2975
P(A | B) ≈ 0.336

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.336 or 33.6%.
