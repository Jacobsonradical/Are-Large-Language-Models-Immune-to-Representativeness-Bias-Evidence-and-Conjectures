Given the information provided, the population is 85% female and 15% male. However, a witness, who is not perfect in determining gender, identified the attacker as male. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we need to consider both the possibility that the witness is correct and the possibility that the witness is incorrect.

If the witness is correct, then the attacker is indeed male. In this case, the probability of the attacker being male is the proportion of males in the population, which is 15%.

However, if the witness is incorrect, then the attacker is actually female, despite the witness's identification. In this case, the probability of the attacker being male is zero, as there is no male attacker in this scenario.

Since we cannot determine with certainty whether the witness is correct or incorrect, we need to consider both possibilities and weigh them based on their probabilities. The probability of the witness being correct is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 0.8 or 80%. The probability of the witness being incorrect is therefore 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 20%.

The probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is therefore the product of the probability that the witness is correct and the probability of a male attacker in the population, and the probability that the witness is incorrect and the probability of a female attacker in the population.

So, the probability of the attacker being male is (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0) = 0.12 or 12%.

Therefore, {probability: 0.12} is the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male.
