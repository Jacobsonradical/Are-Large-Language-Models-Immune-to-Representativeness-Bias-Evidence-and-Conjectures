To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

From the provided information, we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Let's denote the true gender of the attacker as T (either male or female). The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender given that the attacker is male (P(M|T=m)) is 0.8 (80%). Similarly, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's gender given that the attacker is male (P(~M|T=m)) is 0.2 (20%).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the conditional probability P(T=m|Observation), where the observation is the witness's statement. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(T=m|Observation) = P(Observation|T=m) * P(T=m) / P(Observation)

We have P(Observation|T=m) = P(M|T=m) = 0.8, and P(T=m) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male). We also know that P(T=f) = P(total population) - P(T=m) = 0.85.

The probability of any observation P(Observation) is the sum of the probabilities of all possible explanations (here, T=m or T=f):

P(Observation) = P(Observation|T=m) * P(T=m) + P(Observation|T=f) * P(T=f)

However, we only have information about P(Observation|T=m) and P(T=m). Since we don't have any information about P(Observation|T=f), we can't directly compute P(T=m|Observation) using Bayes' theorem.

However, we can make an approximation by assuming that the witness's ability to identify gender is the same for male and female individuals. In this case, we would have P(Observation|T=f) = P(Observation|T=m) = 0.8, and P(T=f) = P(T=m). This would simplify the Bayes' theorem equation to:

P(T=m|Observation) ≈ P(Observation|T=m) * P(T=m) / (P(Observation|T=m) * P(T=m) + P(Observation|T=f) * P(T=f))

Given our assumption that P(Observation|T=f) = P(Observation|T=m) = 0.8, this simplifies to:

P(T=m|Observation) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85)

Calculating this expression gives a probability estimate of approximately 0.11 (11%).

However, this is an approximation, and the actual probability might be different due to the witness's potential bias in identifying gender. To get a more accurate estimate, we would need more information about the witness's performance in identifying gender for male and female individuals.
