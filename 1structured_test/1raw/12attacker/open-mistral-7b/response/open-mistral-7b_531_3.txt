To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the gender distribution in the city and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. The attacker's gender is likely to be either male or female, with the city's gender distribution being 85% female and 15% male.
2. However, the witness's observation might not be perfectly reliable. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

If we assume that the witness's errors are equally likely to be misidentifying a female as male and a male as female, then the witness's observation of "male" could be either an accurate identification or an error.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male.
- P(F|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male.
- P(F|not M) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.

We know that P(M) + P(F) = 1 (since there are only two gender options), and we also know that P(F|M) = 0.8 and P(F|not M) = 0.2 (from the witness's reliability).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can set up a conditional probability: P(M|"male observed") = P("male observed" | M) * P(M) / P("male observed").

Since the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time, P("male observed" | M) = P(M|"male observed") * P(F|not M) + P(M|"male observed") * P(M) = 0.8 * 0.2 + 1 * P(M) = 0.16 + P(M).

Now we can solve for P(M):

P(M|"male observed") = (0.16 + P(M)) / 0.8 = 0.2 * P(M) + 0.2
P(M|"male observed") - 0.2 = 0.2 * P(M)
P(M) = (P(M|"male observed") - 0.2) / 0.2

Substitute P(M|"male observed") with 0.8 * P(M) + 0.2 from the previous equation:

P(M) = ((0.8 * P(M) + 0.2) - 0.2) / 0.2
P(M) = 0.6 * P(M) + 0.04
0.4 * P(M) = 0.04
P(M) = 0.1

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.1 (or 10%). This answer assumes that the witness's errors are equally likely to be misidentifying a female as male and a male as female. If this assumption is not valid, the probability might be different.
