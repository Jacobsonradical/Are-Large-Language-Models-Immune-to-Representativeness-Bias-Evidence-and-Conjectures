Given the information provided, let's break it down:
1. We have a witness who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being male, and the new evidence is the witness's identification.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified as male)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (probability that the witness identifies as male if the attacker is male)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (probability of the attacker being male before considering any evidence)
- P(B) is the probability of B (probability that the witness identifies as male, regardless of the attacker's gender)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender 80% of the time if the attacker is male)
We are given P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is the proportion of males in the population)
We need to find P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)

Where:
- P(B|A^c) is the probability of the witness identifying as male if the attacker is not male.
- P(A^c) is the probability of the attacker not being male, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Since we don't have information about P(B|A^c), let's assume that the witness's ability to identify gender is independent of the attacker's gender, meaning P(B|A^c) = P(B|A) = 0.8. This is a simplifying assumption, and in reality, the witness's ability to identify gender might be different for males and females.

With this assumption, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.28

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B): P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.2857

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.2857 or 28.57% (rounded to two decimal places).

Again, this is a simplifying assumption, and in reality, the witness's ability to identify gender might be different for males and females, affecting the final probability estimate.
