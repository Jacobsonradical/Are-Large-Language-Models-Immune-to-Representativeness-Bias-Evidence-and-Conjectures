Given the information provided, the attacker's gender is initially unknown, and we have a 50-50 chance of it being male or female. However, we also have the information that a witness, who is 80% accurate in determining gender, identified the attacker as male.

The probability of the witness being correct in this instance can be calculated as the product of the witness's accuracy and the probability of the attacker being male, given the city's demographics.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male). Since the city is 85% female and 15% male, we can write P(male) = 0.15.

The witness's accuracy is 0.8.

The probability of the witness being correct, given that the attacker is male, is the product of these two probabilities: P(witness is correct | attacker is male) = P(male) * witness's accuracy = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

However, we are given that the witness was correct. So we are looking for the probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness was correct: P(male | witness is correct) = P(witness is correct | attacker is male) / P(witness is correct)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability:

P(male | witness is correct) = P(witness is correct | attacker is male) / P(witness is correct)
= 0.12 / (P(witness is correct | attacker is female) * P(female) + P(witness is correct | attacker is male) * P(male))
= 0.12 / (0.2 * 0.85 + 0.12 * 0.15)
= 0.12 / (0.17 + 0.018)
= 0.12 / 0.188
= 0.63

So, based on the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.63 or 63%.
