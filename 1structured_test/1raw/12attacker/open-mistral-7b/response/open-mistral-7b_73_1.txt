Given the two pieces of information, let's break it down:

1. 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This means the attacker could be either male or female.

2. A witness identified the attacker as male with a 80% success rate. However, this identification was made under suboptimal conditions, with the witness incorrectly identifying gender 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to account for both the actual gender distribution in the city and the witness's error rate.

Let's call the actual probability of the attacker being male P_m. Then, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male is the witness's success rate: 0.8.

Similarly, let's call the probability of the witness identifying a female as male (a false positive) P_f. Then, the probability of the witness identifying a female as male given that the attacker is female is the witness's error rate: 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can write an equation: 0.8P_m + 0.2P_f = 1

We can rewrite this equation by subtracting 0.2 from both sides and solving for P_m:

0.8P_m = 1 - 0.2P_f

Since 85% of the population is female, P_f = 0.15.

Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

0.8P_m = 0.85

Dividing both sides by 0.8, we find:

P_m = 0.85 / 0.8 = 1.0625

However, since the probability must be between 0 and 1, this result suggests that the witness's identification of the attacker as male is unlikely to be correct. This could indicate that the witness made a mistake, or it could suggest that the attacker is actually female.

In any case, given the information provided, it is not possible to provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. The best we can do is to say that the probability is likely to be less than 15%, the actual proportion of males in the city.

{probability: less than 0.15, with a high degree of uncertainty}
