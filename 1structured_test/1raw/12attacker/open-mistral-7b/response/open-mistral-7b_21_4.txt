To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's error rate and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. If the attacker's gender is actually female, then there is a 20% chance that the witness will mistakenly identify the attacker as male. Conversely, if the attacker's gender is male, then there is an 80% chance that the witness will correctly identify the attacker's gender.

The probability that the attacker is male (P(M)) can be calculated by multiplying the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker (0.8) by the proportion of males in the population (P(Male)) and adding it to the probability that the witness makes an error (0.2) multiplied by the proportion of females in the population (1 - P(Male)).

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

P(M) = 0.8 * P(Male) + 0.2 * (1 - P(Male))

Given that 85% of the population is female, P(Male) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:

P(M) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(M) = 0.12 + 0.1765
P(M) = 0.2965

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.2965 or 29.65%.
