To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

In this case, we have two events:
1. E1: The attacker is male.
2. E2: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We are given the conditional probabilities P(E1|E2) and P(E2), and we want to find P(E1).

From the information given, we have:
1. P(E1|E2) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
2. P(E2) = 0.5 * P(E1) + 0.5 * P(not E1) = 0.5 * P(E1) + 0.5 * (1 - P(E1)) (since the witness has a 50% chance of being correct, and the attacker can be either male or female)

We also have the prior probability P(E1) (the probability of the attacker being male before any evidence is considered). From the second piece of information, we can estimate this value as 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(E1):

P(E1) = P(E1|E2) * P(E2) / P(E2|E1) * P(E1) + P(E1|not E2) * P(not E2) / P(not E2|E1) * P(E1)

Since the witness cannot know the gender of the attacker if the attacker is not male (E1|not E2 = 0), and P(not E2|E1) = 1, this simplifies to:

P(E1) = P(E1|E2) * P(E2) / P(E2) = P(E1|E2)

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (80%).
