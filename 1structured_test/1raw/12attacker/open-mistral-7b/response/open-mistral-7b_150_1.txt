To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in gender identification.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.
2. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we should consider two possible scenarios:

a) The attacker is indeed male, and the witness correctly identified his gender.
b) The attacker is female, and the witness mistakenly identified her as male.

Let's calculate the probabilities for both scenarios and then use Bayes' theorem to find the final probability:

a) The attacker is male:
   Probability of attacker being male = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male)

b) The witness mistakenly identifies a female attacker as male:
   Probability of a female attacker = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female)
   Probability of witness erring = 0.2 (since 20% of the time, the witness errs in gender identification)
   Probability of witness identifying a female attacker as male = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (17%)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the final probability:

P(Attacker is male | Witness identification) = [P(Witness identification | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male)] / [P(Witness identification | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness identification | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female)]

Plugging in the values:

P(Attacker is male | Witness identification) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the result:

P(Attacker is male | Witness identification) â‰ˆ 0.16

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 16%.
