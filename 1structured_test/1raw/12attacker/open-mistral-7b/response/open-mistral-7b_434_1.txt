Given the information provided, we can make an estimate using Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is a probability theory formula that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is male
- ¬H: The attacker is not male (i.e., the attacker is female)
- E: The witness's gender identification

From the given information, we have:
- P(H) = Probability of the attacker being male in the population (unknown)
- P(¬H) = Probability of the attacker being female in the population (1 - P(H))
- P(E|H): Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male = 0.8
- P(E|¬H): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male = 0.2

Since 85% of the population is female, we can estimate P(¬H) as 0.85. Therefore, P(H) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Now, we can find P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)
P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
