To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have information about whether the witness made an error in this specific case, we'll calculate the probability assuming that the witness's error rate applies equally to both male and female genders.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(male). Then, the probability that the witness errs and identifies the attacker as female is P(female) * 0.2 = 0.15P(female).

Given that the witness identifies the attacker as male, the probability that the witness was correct is P(male) * 0.8.

The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is male is thus P(male) * 0.8.

Similarly, the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is female is 0.15P(female) * 0.2.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement. This is calculated as the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is male divided by the total likelihood of the witness's statement.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.8 * P(male) / (0.8 * P(male) + 0.15P(female) * 0.2)}

However, we don't have a concrete value for P(female). The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male, so P(female) = 0.85 and P(male) = 0.15.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.15 * 0.85 * 0.2)}

Calculating this value, we find that the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.562 or 56.2%.
