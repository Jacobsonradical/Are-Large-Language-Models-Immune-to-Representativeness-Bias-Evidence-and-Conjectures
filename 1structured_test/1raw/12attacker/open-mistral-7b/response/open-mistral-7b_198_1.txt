To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can consider two scenarios:

1. The witness's observation is accurate. In this case, the attacker is indeed male. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability of this scenario is 0.8 (or 80%).

2. The witness's observation is inaccurate. In this case, the attacker is actually female, but the witness mistakenly identifies them as male. Given that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, the probability of this scenario is 0.2 (or 20%).

However, we know that the witness identified the attacker as male, which means the first scenario must have occurred. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 (or 80%).

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.8}
