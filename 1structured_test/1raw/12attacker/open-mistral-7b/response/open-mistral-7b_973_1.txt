To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the gender distribution in the population.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we don't have enough information to determine if the witness's errors are more likely to be misidentifying males as females or females as males, we'll assume an equal error rate. This means that the witness errs 10% in each direction (5% misidentifying males as females and 5% misidentifying females as males).

Given that the city's population is 85% female and 15% male, let's denote the frequency of males in the population as p and the frequency of females as 1 - p.

The witness's observation of a person leads them to identify that person as male with probability p. However, due to their error rate, they will mistakenly identify a female as male with probability 0.1*p (10% of the time). The total probability of the witness identifying a female as male is 0.1*(1-p) (10% of the time).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, the event we are interested in is the union of two events: the witness correctly identifying a male and the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male. This can be written as p + 0.1*(1-p).

The probability that the attacker is indeed a male is p. So, the probability estimate is p, which can be found by solving the equation p + 0.1*(1-p) = 0.8 (the witness's correct identification rate) for p.

We can solve this equation by rearranging terms and finding the value of p that satisfies the equation:

0.8 = p + 0.1 - 0.1*p
0.09 = -0.1*p
p = 0.09 / 0.1
p = 0.9

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.9 or 90%.
