To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. Population Distribution: If 85% of the city's population is female, then 15% must be male.

2. Witness's Reliability: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness errs, there is a chance that a female could be mistakenly identified as male and vice versa.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can assume that the witness's mistake rate applies to the case where the attacker is actually female. Let's denote the true probability of the attacker being male as P(male).

The probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female as male is P(female) * 0.20 (where 0.20 is the witness's error rate).

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can set up the equation:

P(male) + P(female) * 0.20 = 1 (as this represents the total probability)

We know that P(female) = 0.85 (from the population distribution), so we can solve for P(male):

P(male) = 1 - 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.155

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.155, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
