To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge and new evidence.

In this case, the prior probability of the attacker being male is given by the city's demographics, which is 15%. The new evidence is the witness's gender identification, which was male.

The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's gender (given that the attacker is indeed male) is 20%, as stated in the information. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender (given that the attacker is male) is therefore 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 or 80%.

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is male | witness's identification) = (P(witness's identification | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male)) / P(witness's identification)

The probability of the witness's identification (regardless of the attacker's gender) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (0.80) and incorrectly identifying a female attacker (0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17).

So P(witness's identification) = 0.80 + 0.17 = 0.97

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is male | witness's identification) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.97 = 0.1234 or approximately 12.34%

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 12.34%.
