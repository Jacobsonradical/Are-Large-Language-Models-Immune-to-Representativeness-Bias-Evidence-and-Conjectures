To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we can calculate the probability of a false positive (mistaking a female for a male) and the probability of a false negative (mistaking a male for a female) in the witness's statement.

The probability of a false positive is the probability of choosing a female and having the witness mistake her for a male:

P(False Positive) = Probability of choosing a female * Probability of misidentifying a female as male
                  = 0.5 * 0.2
                  = 0.1

The probability of a false negative is the probability of choosing a male and having the witness mistake him for a female:

P(False Negative) = Probability of choosing a male * Probability of misidentifying a male as female
                  = 0.5 * 0.2
                  = 0.1

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we're interested in the probability of a true positive (correctly identifying a male) or a false negative (mistaking a male for a female):

P(True Positive or False Negative) = P(True Positive) + P(False Negative)
                         = 1 - P(False Positive)
                         = 1 - 0.1
                         = 0.9

However, we need to account for the gender distribution in the city. Since 85% of the population is female, the remaining 15% must be male. Therefore, the probability of choosing a male is 0.15.

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness Statement) = P(True Positive) / P(True Positive or False Negative)
                                = P(True Positive) / (P(True Positive) + P(False Negative))
                                = 0.15 * 0.9 / (0.15 * 0.9 + 0.15 * 0.1)
                                = 0.135 / 0.21
                                = 0.638

The estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.638 or 63.8%.
