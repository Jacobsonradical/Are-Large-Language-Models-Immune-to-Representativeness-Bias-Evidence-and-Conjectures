To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. According to the provided information, 15% of the population in the city is male.
2. However, the witness's ability to identify gender is not perfect. They correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err in 20% of the cases.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, it's not necessarily the case that the attacker is actually male 100% of the time. There's a chance that the witness made an error.
4. To account for the witness's error rate, we can calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker and the probability of the witness erroneously identifying a female attacker as male.
5. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 (the witness's success rate) * 0.15 (the proportion of males in the population).
6. The probability of the witness erroneously identifying a female attacker as male is 0.2 (the witness's error rate) * 0.85 (the proportion of females in the population).
7. Since we don't have enough information to determine which of these two probabilities is higher, we can't definitively say that the attacker is more likely to be male or female based on the witness's statement alone.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, strictly in the requested format, is: {probability: cannot be definitively determined, please do not provide a number between 0 and 1}
