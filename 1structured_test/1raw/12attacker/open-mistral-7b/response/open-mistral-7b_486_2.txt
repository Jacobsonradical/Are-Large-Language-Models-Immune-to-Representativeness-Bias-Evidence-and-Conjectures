To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's gender 20% of the time. This means that they correctly identify gender 80% of the time. Since the attacker's gender is unknown, we can think of the witness's statements about the attacker as a binary event: either they correctly identify the attacker as male or they incorrectly identify them as male. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, there's a 0.8 probability that they would correctly identify the attacker as male if the attacker actually is male.

However, since we don't know if the attacker is male or female, we need to consider both possibilities. If the attacker is female, then there's a 0.2 probability that the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as male.

The probability that the attacker is male can be estimated by considering these two probabilities and the relative frequency of males in the population. According to the information provided, 15% of the population in the city is male.

So, the probability that the attacker is male (P(male)) can be estimated as the product of the witness's probability of correctly identifying a male and the frequency of males in the population:

P(male) = Probability of witness identifying male correctly * Probability of attacker being male
           = 0.8 * 0.15

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 or 12%.
