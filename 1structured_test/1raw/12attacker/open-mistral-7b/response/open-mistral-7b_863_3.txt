To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the initial population information (85% female, 15% male) and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender (80%).

The witness's incorrect identification of gender (20%) can be considered as a mix of both genders. Since the population is 85% female and 15% male, the probability of the witness mistaking a female for a male is higher due to the majority population.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(male). The probability of the witness mistaking a female for a male is then 0.85 * P(male) + 0.15 * (1 - P(male)).

The witness correctly identified the attacker as male in this case. So we can say that 0.20 = 0.15 * (1 - P(male)) + 0.85 * P(male).

Solving for P(male) gives us:

P(male) = 0.20 / (0.85 - 0.20) = 0.20 / 0.65 â‰ˆ 0.308

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.308 or 30.8%.
