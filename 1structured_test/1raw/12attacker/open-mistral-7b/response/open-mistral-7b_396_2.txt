Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male. Bayes' theorem is a formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

The formula is as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (probability of the attacker being male given the attack information)
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies a male as male)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (probability of the attacker being male before any evidence)
- P(B) is the probability of B (probability of the witness's observation)

From the information provided, we can calculate the following:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (given that 85% of the population is female, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 15%)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
                = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
                = 0.12 + 0.1775
                = 0.3075

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
         = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.3075
         = 0.12 / 0.3075
         = 0.39 (approximately)

So, our estimate is that there is a 39% probability that the attacker is male.
