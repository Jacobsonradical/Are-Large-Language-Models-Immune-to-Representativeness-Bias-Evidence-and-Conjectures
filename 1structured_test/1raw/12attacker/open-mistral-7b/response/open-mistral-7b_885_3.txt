To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know whether the witness's errors are more likely to favor one gender over the other. If we assume that the errors are random, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

P(Attacker is male | Witness's gender identification) = [P(Witness's gender identification | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male)] / [P(Witness's gender identification | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness's gender identification | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female)]

We are given that the witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Let's denote the probability of the witness identifying a male as 'p' and the probability of the witness identifying a female as '1-p'.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can write P(Attacker is male) = 0.15 and P(Attacker is female) = 0.85.

Now we can find the probabilities P(Witness's gender identification | Attacker is male) and P(Witness's gender identification | Attacker is female):

P(Witness's gender identification | Attacker is male) = p
P(Witness's gender identification | Attacker is female) = 1 - p

Substituting these probabilities into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Attacker is male | Witness's gender identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this probability, we get:

P(Attacker is male | Witness's gender identification) â‰ˆ 0.156

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 15.6%.
