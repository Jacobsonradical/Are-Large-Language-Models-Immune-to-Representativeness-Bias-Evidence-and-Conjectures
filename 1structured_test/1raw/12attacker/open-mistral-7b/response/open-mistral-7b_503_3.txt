To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the new evidence is the witness's statement. Let's call the probability of the hypothesis H (i.e., the attacker is male) and the probability of the evidence E (i.e., the witness identified a male attacker).

We have two pieces of information:

1. The prior probability of H, denoted as P(H), is the probability that the attacker is male before considering any evidence. Since we don't have this information, we can assume it's equal to the proportion of males in the population, which is 15% (from information b). So, P(H) = 0.15.

2. The likelihood of E given H, denoted as P(E|H), is the probability that the witness would correctly identify a male attacker. From information a, this probability is 0.80.

3. The likelihood of E given not-H, denoted as P(E|not-H), is the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify a female attacker as male. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this probability is 0.20.

To find P(not-H), the probability that the attacker is female, we can use the formula P(not-H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not-H) * P(not-H)]

Substituting the values:

P(H|E) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.17

So, our estimate, based on the given information, is that the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 17%.
