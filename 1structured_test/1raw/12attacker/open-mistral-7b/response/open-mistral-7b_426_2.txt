Given the information provided, we have two sources of evidence: the population demographics and the witness's testimony.

1. From the population demographics (information "a"), we know that 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. From the witness's testimony (information "b"), we know that the witness is not infallible in gender identification, as they incorrectly identify gender 20% of the time. However, when they do make a gender identification, they get it right 80% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is actually male. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given evidence B is given by:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is male, B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male, and P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of whether the attacker is male or not.

We are given P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of males in the population), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying males), and P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 (the overall accuracy of the witness).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.12 = 0.12 / 0.12 = 1

However, this result is not meaningful, as probabilities must be between 0 and 1. The reason for this result is that Bayes' theorem assumes independence between events A and B, which is not the case here, as the witness's accuracy in identifying gender depends on the gender of the person they are observing.

To account for this dependence, we can use a more sophisticated model, such as the likelihood ratio test or a naive Bayes classifier, which take into account the prior probabilities of different genders and the witness's accuracy in identifying each gender. However, such models require more specific information, which is not provided in the given data.

Therefore, without more information, it is not possible to provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker is male. However, based on the population demographics, it would be more likely that the attacker is female (85% chance), and the witness's testimony slightly increases this uncertainty, but not enough to change our initial assumption significantly.
