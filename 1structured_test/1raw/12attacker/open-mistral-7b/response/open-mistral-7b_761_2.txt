Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated as follows:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
2. However, we also know that the witness, who identified the attacker as male, is only correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time when judging gender.
3. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, it's likely that they were correct in their identification 80% of the time. But we need to account for the fact that there is a higher percentage of females in the city.
4. To estimate the probability of the attacker being male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for updating the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence:
   P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
   where H is the hypothesis that the attacker is male, E is the evidence (the witness's identification), P(H) is the prior probability, P(E|H) is the likelihood, and P(E) is the marginal likelihood.
5. In this case, P(H) is 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is male), P(E|H) is 0.8 (the likelihood that the witness is correct when the attacker is male), and P(E) is the sum of the product of the prior probability and the likelihood for both genders.
6. Calculating P(E) involves finding the probability of the witness identifying a male as male and a female as male: P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H), where ~H is the hypothesis that the attacker is female.
7. Since P(E|~H) is 0.2 (the likelihood that the witness is incorrect when the attacker is female), and P(~H) is 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is female), we can calculate P(E): 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
8. Now we can calculate P(H|E): 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.0966 or approximately 9.66%.

However, it's important to note that this estimation is based on several assumptions and simplifications, and the actual probability might be different in reality. The witness's ability to judge gender and the distribution of genders in the city might not perfectly align with the given data. Therefore, this estimation should be taken with a grain of salt.
