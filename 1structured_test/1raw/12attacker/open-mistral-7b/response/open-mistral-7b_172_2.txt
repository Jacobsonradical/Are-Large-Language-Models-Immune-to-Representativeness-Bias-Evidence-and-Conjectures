Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a probability theory that allows us to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's statement and the city's gender distribution.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence (the witness's statement and the city's gender distribution)
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being male before considering the evidence. We don't have this information, but it can be estimated based on the city's gender distribution (15%).
- P(E|H): the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is true. This is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is 0.8.
- P(E|~H): the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is false. This is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is the probability of being wrong when judging gender, 0.2, multiplied by the proportion of females in the city, 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85 * 0.2)] â‰ˆ 0.159 or 15.9%

So, given the information and assuming the witness's ability to judge gender is representative of the night in question, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 15.9%.
