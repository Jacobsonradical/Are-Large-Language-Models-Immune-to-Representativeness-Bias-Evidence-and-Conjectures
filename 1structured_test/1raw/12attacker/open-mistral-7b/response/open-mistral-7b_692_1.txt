To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is male
- Σ: the attacker is female
- E: the witness's identification of a male

According to the given information, we have the following probabilities:
- P(H) = probability that the attacker is male = 0.15 (from b)
- P(Σ) = probability that the attacker is female = 0.85 (from b)
- P(E|H) = probability that the witness identifies a male as male when the attacker is male = 0.8 (from a)
- P(E|Σ) = probability that the witness identifies a male as male when the attacker is female = 0.2 (from a)

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|Σ) * P(Σ)]

Substituting the given probabilities:

P(H|E) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating the expression:

P(H|E) ≈ 0.184

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.184 or 18.4%.
