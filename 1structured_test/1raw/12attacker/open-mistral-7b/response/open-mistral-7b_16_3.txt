To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city.

First, let's calculate the expected error rate of the witness in identifying the gender of the attacker. Since 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85 and the probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. Given that the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, the probability of the witness erring when the attacker is female is 0.20.

So, the expected number of times the witness errs when the attacker is female is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the expected number of times the witness correctly identifies the attacker as female is 0.85 * 0.80 = 0.68.

Similarly, the expected number of times the witness errs when the attacker is male is 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03. The expected number of times the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we are interested in the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender, which is the sum of the expected number of times the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male and the expected number of times the witness errs when the attacker is female but is mistakenly identified as male: 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15.

However, the witness identified the attacker as male, so we are actually interested in the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. We can calculate this probability by dividing the expected number of times the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male by the sum of the expected number of times the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male and the expected number of times the witness errs when the attacker is female: 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.15) = 0.43.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is 0.43 or 43%.
