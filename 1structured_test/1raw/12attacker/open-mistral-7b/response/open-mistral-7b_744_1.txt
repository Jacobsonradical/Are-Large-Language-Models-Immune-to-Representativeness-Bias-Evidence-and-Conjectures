Based on the information provided, there are two sources of probability estimates: the population statistics and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

1. Population statistics: The city's population is 85% female and 15% male. Without any additional information, we would expect an attacker to be female 85% of the time and male 15% of the time.

2. Witness's ability to identify gender: The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's errors are more likely to be identifying females as males or males as females. Without this information, we cannot adjust the population statistics based on the witness's accuracy.

Given that we cannot adjust the population statistics based on the witness's ability, and we must assume that an attacker is as likely to be identified as male by a witness as female, the most conservative estimate would be to use the population statistics as our probability estimate.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is 15%, based on the city's population statistics.
