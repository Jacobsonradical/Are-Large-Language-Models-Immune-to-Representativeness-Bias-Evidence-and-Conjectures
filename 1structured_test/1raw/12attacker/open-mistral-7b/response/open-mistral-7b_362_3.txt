To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, the witness identified the attacker as male. Given that the city has an 85% female population and a 15% male population, the witness's identification might be an error.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M). The probability of the witness erring and identifying the attacker as male when the attacker is actually female is P(F) * (1 - 0.8), where P(F) is the probability of the attacker being female.

Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we have P(M) = 1 - P(F) * (1 - 0.8).

We know that P(F) = 0.15 (from the information about the city's gender distribution). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

P(M) = 1 - 0.15 * (1 - 0.8)

P(M) = 1 - 0.15 * 0.2

P(M) = 0.205

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 20.5%.
