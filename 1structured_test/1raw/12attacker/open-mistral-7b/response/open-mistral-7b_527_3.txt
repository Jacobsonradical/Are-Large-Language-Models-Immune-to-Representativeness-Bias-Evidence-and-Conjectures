To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's reliability.

1. The population distribution: 85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male.

2. The witness's reliability: In a 50-50 gender split, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, meaning they err 20% of the time.

However, the witness's reliability is not directly applicable to the actual population distribution (which is not 50-50 but 85-15). To account for this, we can calculate the expected error rate for the given population distribution.

Let P(female) be the probability of the attacker being female, and P(male) be the probability of the attacker being male. We know P(female) = 0.85 and P(male) = 0.15.

The witness's reliability in identifying gender can be represented by two probabilities: the probability of correctly identifying a male as male (P(correct|male)) and the probability of incorrectly identifying a female as male (P(incorrect|female)).

From the witness's performance in a 50-50 gender split, we know that P(correct|male) = 0.8 and P(incorrect|female) = 0.2.

Given the actual population distribution, we can calculate the expected error rate as:

Error rate = P(incorrect|female) * P(female) + P(incorrect|male) * P(male)

Since the witness never mistakes a male for a female, P(incorrect|male) = 0.

Now we can write the error rate as:

Error rate = P(incorrect|female) * P(female)

The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time in a 50-50 gender split, so:

P(incorrect|female) = 0.2

Plugging this value into the error rate equation, we get:

Error rate = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

The witness's actual error rate in this situation is 17%.

Now, since the witness reported the attacker as male, and they make mistakes 17% of the time, it means there is a 17% chance that the witness was mistaken, and the attacker is actually female.

So, to find the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's report, we subtract the error rate from 1:

P(male|report) = 1 - Error rate

P(male|report) = 1 - 0.17

P(male|report) â‰ˆ 0.83

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is around 0.83 or 83%.
