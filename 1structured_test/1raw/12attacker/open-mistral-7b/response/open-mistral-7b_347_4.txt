Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for updating the probability for a hypothesis based on evidence.

Let's denote:
- H: the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

The prior probability of the hypothesis H (P(H)) is given by the proportion of males in the city, which is 15%.

The likelihood of the evidence E given the hypothesis H (P(E|H)) is the witness's ability to correctly identify the gender of a male, which is 80%.

The likelihood of the evidence E given the negation of the hypothesis H (P(E|~H)) is the witness's ability to incorrectly identify the gender of a male, which is 20%.

The likelihood of the negation of the evidence E given the hypothesis H (P(~E|H)) is 1 - P(E|H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

The likelihood of the negation of the evidence E given the negation of the hypothesis H (P(~E|~H)) is 1 - P(E|~H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / 0.196 = 0.6139

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.614 or 61.39%.
