To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider two factors: the general population statistics and the witness's reliability in identifying gender.

1. The general population statistics indicate that 15% of the city's population is male.
2. The witness's reliability in identifying gender is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possibilities:
a) The witness correctly identified a male attacker.
b) The witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male.

Let's calculate the probability for each of these scenarios:

a) Probability of witness correctly identifying a male attacker:
Since 15% of the population is male, the probability of choosing a male from the population is 0.15.

b) Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male:
Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of choosing a female from the population is 0.85.

Given the witness's reliability, the probability of incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.2 (or 20%).

So, the probability of the witness making such a mistake is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%).

Therefore, the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker is 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 (or 83%).

Since we know the attacker is either a male or a female, and the witness identified the attacker as male, the final probability that the attacker is male is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, which is 0.83.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.83}
