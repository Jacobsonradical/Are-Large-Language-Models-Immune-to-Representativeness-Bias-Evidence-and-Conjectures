To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the city. Let's denote the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as P_m and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male as P_f.

From the information provided, we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so P_m + P_f = 0.8. We also know that the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, so P_f = 0.2. Substituting this into the first equation, we get P_m = 0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we need to consider the gender distribution in the city. We know that 85% of the population is female, so the probability of an attacker being female is 0.85. Given this information and the reliability of the witness, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is P_m, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as a male is P_f. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male attacker as a female is 1 - P_m.

So, the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male is P_m. The probability of the witness identifying an attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female is P_f.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the total probability of this event is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker plus the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as a male.

So, the probability of the attacker being male is:

P(attacker is male) = (P_m * 0.15) + (P_f * 0.85)

Substituting P_m = 0.6 and P_f = 0.2 into the equation, we get:

P(attacker is male) = (0.6 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)

P(attacker is male) = 0.09 + 0.1725

P(attacker is male) â‰ˆ 0.2625

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 26.25%.
