To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the information given and make an assumption about the reliability of the witness's gender identification under the specific conditions of the night.

Given that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male, we can calculate the base probability of the attacker being female or male. The base probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15%).

However, the witness's ability to identify gender was found to be 80% accurate in favorable conditions, with an error rate of 20%. This means that, in the best-case scenario, the witness would correctly identify a male attacker 80% of the time.

The witness stated that the attacker was male. If we assume that the witness's gender identification is like the best-case scenario (80% accurate), then we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed male based on the witness's statement.

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and assuming the witness's gender identification is 80% accurate, would be 0.8 (or 80%).

However, it's important to note that this is an estimation based on assumptions, and the actual probability might be different due to factors not accounted for in the given information. For example, the witness's ability to identify gender under dim lighting or in a stressful situation could be different from their ability in favorable conditions. Therefore, this probability should be considered as an approximation.
