To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the reliability of the witness's gender identification and the actual gender distribution in the population.

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the probability of randomly selecting a male from the population is 0.15.

The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there are two possibilities:

1. The attacker is indeed male, and the witness correctly identified the gender. The probability of this is 0.15 (probability of selecting a male from the population) * 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a male).

2. The attacker is female, and the witness mistakenly identified the gender. The probability of this is 0.85 (probability of selecting a female from the population) * 0.2 (probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male).

Since we cannot know which of these two scenarios actually happened, we need to consider both possibilities and weight them by their probabilities. The total probability of the attacker being male is the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios where the attacker is indeed male and where the attacker is mistakenly identified as male by the witness:

Total probability of attacker being male = Probability of correct identification + Probability of mistaken identification
                                                     = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2
                                                     = 0.12 + 0.17
                                                     = 0.29

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.29, or 29%.
