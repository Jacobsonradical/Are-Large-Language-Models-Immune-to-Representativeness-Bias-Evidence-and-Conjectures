To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the original proportion of males in the city (15%) and the reliability of the witness's gender identification (80% accuracy).

The witness's testimony indicates that there is a 20% chance of misidentifying a person's gender. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, there is a 20% chance that the witness was mistaken and the attacker is actually female.

However, since 85% of the city's population is female, the probability that the witness was mistaken and the attacker is female is equal to the proportion of females in the city multiplied by the witness's error rate:

Probability of mistake = 0.85 (proportion of females) * 0.20 (error rate) = 0.17 or 17%

So, the probability that the witness was correct and the attacker is male is the complement of the probability of a mistake, which is:

Probability of attacker being male = 1 - Probability of mistake = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83 or 83%

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.83 or 83%.
