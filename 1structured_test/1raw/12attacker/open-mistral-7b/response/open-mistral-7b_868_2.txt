To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's ability to accurately identify gender and the gender distribution in the city.

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the actual gender is male, the witness correctly identifies it as male 80% of the time, and when the actual gender is female, the witness incorrectly identifies it as male 20% of the time.

2. The city has a gender distribution of 85% female and 15% male.

3. To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the witness's probability of misidentifying a female as male, which is 20%, and the true probability of the attacker being male, which is 15%.

4. We can set up an equation using Bayes' theorem: P(Attacker is Male | Witness's Gender Identification) = [P(Witness's Gender Identification is Male) * P(Attacker is Male)] / [P(Witness's Gender Identification is Male) * P(Attacker is Male) + P(Witness's Gender Identification is Male) * P(Attacker is Female) + P(Witness's Gender Identification is Female) * P(Attacker is Male) + P(Witness's Gender Identification is Female) * P(Attacker is Female)].

5. Substituting the given values into the equation, we get: P(Attacker is Male | Witness's Gender Identification) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) + (0.2 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)].

6. Solving this equation, we get: P(Attacker is Male | Witness's Gender Identification) = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's gender identification, is approximately 0.12 or 12%. This is significantly lower than the actual gender distribution of 15% in the city, which suggests that the witness's gender identification might not be reliable in this case. However, it's important to note that this is a theoretical calculation based on the given information and assumes that the witness's gender identification ability is consistent under all conditions. Real-world circumstances may lead to different results.
