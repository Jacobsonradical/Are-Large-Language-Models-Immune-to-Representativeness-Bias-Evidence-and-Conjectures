Given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated by considering the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city.

The witness incorrectly identifies a person's gender 20% of the time. However, in this case, the witness identified the attacker as male. This means that there's a 20% chance that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually female.

On the other hand, the city's gender distribution is 85% female and 15% male. This means that there's a 15% chance that the attacker is male, even if the witness had provided no information.

Since the witness's error rate is added to the city's gender rate, the combined probability of the attacker being male is:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.15, probability: 0.215}

So, with these assumptions, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.215 or 21.5%.
