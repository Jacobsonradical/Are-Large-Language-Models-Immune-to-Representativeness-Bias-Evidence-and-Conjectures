Given the information provided, we have two sources of data: the distribution of gender in the city and the witness's ability to accurately identify gender.

1. The distribution of gender in the city is 85% female and 15% male.
2. The witness's ability to accurately identify gender is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

However, the witness's mistake rate does not directly apply to the city's gender distribution because we don't know if the witness's errors are more likely to occur when identifying males or females. Therefore, we cannot use the witness's error rate to adjust the city's gender distribution.

The only reliable information we have is the city's gender distribution, which suggests that the attacker is more likely to be female (85%) than male (15%).

So, based on the available information, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.15}
