A person was attacked from behind at night, and the victim could not see the attacker's gender. Despite this, we have the following two pieces of information:

{
  "a": "A witness identified the attacker as male. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's gender under conditions similar to that night. Given a sample of people, half female and half male, the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.",
  "b": "85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male."
}

What is your estimate of the probability that the attacker is male?

Please answer the question in the following format: {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
