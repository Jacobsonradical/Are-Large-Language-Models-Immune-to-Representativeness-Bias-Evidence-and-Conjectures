{probability: 0.722, please provide a number between 0 and 1} 

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is female and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is female given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Given that P(A) = 0.85 and P(not A) = 0.15, we can calculate:

P(B|A) = 0.2 (20% error rate for identifying gender)
P(B|not A) = 0.8 (80% correct rate for identifying gender)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.2 * 0.85 / [0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15] = 0.722
