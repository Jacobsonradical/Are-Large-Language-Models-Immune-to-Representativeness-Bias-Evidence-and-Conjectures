{probability: 0.774} 

To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let A be the event that the attacker is male and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. 

We are looking for P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. 

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the information provided:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified gender as male)
P(A) = 0.15 (probability that attacker is male)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.25

Therefore,
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.48.
