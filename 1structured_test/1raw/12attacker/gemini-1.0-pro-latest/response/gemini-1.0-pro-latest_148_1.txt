Explanation:
First, it is important to note that the witness's statement does not contradict the fact that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male. This is because the witness could have made a mistake in their identification. However, we can use the witness's statement to update our belief about the probability that the attacker is male.

Let's represent the following events:
- M: The attacker is male.
- F: The attacker is female.
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the given information, we know that:

P(F) = 0.85
P(M) = 0.15
P(W|M) = 0.8
P(W|F) = 0.2

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identifies them as male:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]
P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) = 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identifies them as male is 0.4138.
