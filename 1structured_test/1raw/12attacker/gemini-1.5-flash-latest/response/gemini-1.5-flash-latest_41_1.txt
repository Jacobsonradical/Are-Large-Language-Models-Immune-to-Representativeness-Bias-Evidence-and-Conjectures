Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (From information 'a')
* **P(F) = 0.85** (From information 'a')

**3. Conditional Probabilities (Based on Witness Testimony):**

* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness's testimony. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

To find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F) 
P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate P(M|W):**

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
