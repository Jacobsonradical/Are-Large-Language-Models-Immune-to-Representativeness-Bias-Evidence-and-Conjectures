Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. We want to find the probability of the attacker being male (event A) given that a witness identified them as male (event B). 

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A (attacker is male) given event B (witness identified as male)
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B (witness identified as male) given event A (attacker is male) 
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A (probability of a male in the population)
* P(B) = Prior probability of event B (overall probability of a witness identifying someone as male)

**Let's break down each part:**

* **P(B|A):** The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8
* **P(A):** The probability of a male in the population is 15%, so P(A) = 0.15
* **P(B):** This requires a bit more calculation. It's the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, regardless of their actual gender. We need to consider two scenarios:

    * **Scenario 1:** The person is male (probability 0.15), and the witness identifies them correctly (probability 0.8):  0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
    * **Scenario 2:** The person is female (probability 0.85), and the witness misidentifies them as male (probability 0.2): 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

    Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
