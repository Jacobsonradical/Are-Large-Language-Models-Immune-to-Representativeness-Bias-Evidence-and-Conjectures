Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two sources of information:

* **Prior probability:** The overall gender distribution in the city (85% female, 15% male).
* **Witness testimony:** The witness's accuracy in identifying gender, with a known error rate.

We need to combine these to get the probability the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A): Prior probability of event A.
* P(B): Prior probability of event B.

**Let's define our events:**

* A: Attacker is male.
* B: Witness identified the attacker as male.

**Now, let's calculate the probabilities:**

* P(A): 0.15 (Prior probability of a male attacker, based on city demographics)
* P(B|A): 0.80 (Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male)
* P(B|not A): 0.20 (Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)
* P(not A): 0.85 (Prior probability of a female attacker)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios where the attacker is male and female:

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:**

* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
* P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
