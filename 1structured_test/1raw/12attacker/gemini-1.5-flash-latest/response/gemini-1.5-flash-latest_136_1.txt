Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **M:** The attacker is male.
*  **F:** The attacker is female.
*  **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

* **P(M|W):** The probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male. This is what we want to find.
* **P(W|M):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male (80% accuracy).
* **P(M):** The prior probability of the attacker being male (15%).
* **P(W):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability: P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

**3. Calculate the Probabilities:**

* **P(W|M) = 0.8** (given)
* **P(M) = 0.15** (given)
* **P(W|F) = 0.2** (since the witness is 80% accurate, they'll incorrectly identify a female as male 20% of the time).
* **P(F) = 0.85** (given)

**4. Calculate P(W):**

* P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**5. Calculate P(M|W):**

* P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4615}
