Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is the percentage of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2. Likelihood Ratio:**

* The witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time.
* The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time.
* The likelihood ratio is the probability of the witness identifying a male (80%) divided by the probability of the witness identifying a female as male (20%): 80/20 = 4.

**3. Posterior Probability:**

* The posterior probability (the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony) can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

  Posterior Probability = (Prior Probability * Likelihood Ratio) / [(Prior Probability * Likelihood Ratio) + (1 - Prior Probability)]

* Plugging in the values:

  Posterior Probability = (0.15 * 4) / [(0.15 * 4) + (0.85 * 1)] 
  Posterior Probability = 0.6 / 1.35
  Posterior Probability â‰ˆ 0.444

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.444}
