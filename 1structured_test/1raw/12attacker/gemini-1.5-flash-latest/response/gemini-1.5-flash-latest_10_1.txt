Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Understanding the Problem**

We have a prior probability (based on the city's population) and new evidence (the witness's testimony). We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender.

**2.  Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**3.  Defining Events**

*  Let A be the event that the attacker is male.
*  Let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

**4.  Applying Bayes' Theorem**

* P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability of the attacker being male)
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male)
* P(B|not A) = 0.20 (Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (Prior probability of the attacker being female)

To find P(B), we need the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.414 or approximately 41.4%.**
