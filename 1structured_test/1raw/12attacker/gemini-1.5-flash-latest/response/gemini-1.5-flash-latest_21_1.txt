Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the percentage of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying male given male attacker:** This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **Likelihood of witness saying male given female attacker:** This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's statement:

P(Male | Witness said Male) = [P(Witness said Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness said Male)

To calculate P(Witness said Male), we need to consider both possibilities:

P(Witness said Male) = [P(Witness said Male | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness said Male | Female) * P(Female)] 
                      = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Putting it Together:**

P(Male | Witness said Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                              â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
