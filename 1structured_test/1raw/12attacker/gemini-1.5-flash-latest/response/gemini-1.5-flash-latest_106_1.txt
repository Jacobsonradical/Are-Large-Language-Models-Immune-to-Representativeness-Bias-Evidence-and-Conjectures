Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** The city's population demographics tell us that the prior probability of a randomly chosen person being male is 15% (0.15).
* **Likelihoods:**  The witness's accuracy gives us the likelihoods of observing the evidence (witness identifying the attacker as male) given different scenarios:
    * **Likelihood of Male:** The witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time.
    * **Likelihood of Female:** The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time.

**2.  Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on new evidence:

P(Male | Witness) = [P(Witness | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness)

Where:

* P(Male | Witness) is the probability the attacker is male given the witness's testimony.
* P(Witness | Male) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given the attacker is actually male (0.80).
* P(Male) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15).
* P(Witness) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which we need to calculate.

**3. Calculating P(Witness)**

P(Witness) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(Witness) = P(Witness | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness | Female) * P(Female)
           = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4.  Putting It Together**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Male | Witness) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                 â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
