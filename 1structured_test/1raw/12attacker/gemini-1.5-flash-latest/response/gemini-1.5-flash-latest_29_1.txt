Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic Bayesian inference problem. We need to update our belief about the attacker's gender (male or female) given the witness's testimony and the population demographics.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is male.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**Applying the information:**

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in the problem).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male is 80% (given in the problem).
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 20% (given in the problem).

**Calculating P(B):**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying a male as male and the probability of the witness identifying a female as male:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.28

**Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.28
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.43

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.43}
