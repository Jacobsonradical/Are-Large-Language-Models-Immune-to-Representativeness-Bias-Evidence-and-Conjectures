Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two sources of information:

1. **Population demographics:**  The city has a high proportion of females (85%). This is our prior belief.
2. **Witness testimony:** The witness claims the attacker was male.  We know the witness's accuracy in identifying gender. This is our new evidence.

We need to update our belief about the attacker's gender (originally based on demographics) considering the new evidence from the witness.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find)
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened
* P(A): Prior probability of event A happening
* P(B): Probability of event B happening

**Applying to our problem:**

* **A:** The attacker is male.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

Let's break down the terms in Bayes' Theorem:

* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being male = 0.15 (based on city demographics)
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male = 0.80 (witness accuracy)
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually female = 0.20 (witness error)
* **P(¬A):** Prior probability of the attacker being female = 0.85 

We need to calculate P(B) (probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male). We can use the law of total probability:

* **P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)**
* **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**

**Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):**

* **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414** (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Even with the witness's testimony, the probability of the attacker being male is still significantly lower than the probability of the attacker being female. While the witness's testimony provides evidence, it doesn't completely overturn our initial belief based on city demographics.
