Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic case of Bayes' Theorem. We want to find the probability of the attacker being male (event A) given the witness's statement (event B).  

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement. This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male. This is the witness's accuracy (80%).
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being male (15% from the population data).
* P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (this needs to be calculated).

**Calculating P(B)**

We can calculate P(B) using the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Where:

* P(B|not A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is female. This is the witness's error rate (20%).
* P(not A) = Prior probability of the attacker being female (85%).

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
