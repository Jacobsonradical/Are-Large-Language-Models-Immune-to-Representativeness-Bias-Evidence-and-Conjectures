Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in "a").

**2. Likelihood Ratios:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given attacker is male:** 80% (witness accuracy)
* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given attacker is female:** 20% (witness error rate)

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on new evidence:

P(Male | Witness says "male") = [P(Witness says "male" | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says "male")

To find P(Witness says "male"), we need to consider both scenarios:

* P(Witness says "male" | Male) * P(Male) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* P(Witness says "male" | Female) * P(Female) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(Witness says "male") = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Calculation:**

P(Male | Witness says "male") = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
