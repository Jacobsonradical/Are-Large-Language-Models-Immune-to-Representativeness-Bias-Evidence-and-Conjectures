Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is not perfect, and their accuracy is affected by the conditions that night. This means we need to consider both the witness's statement AND their likelihood of being correct.
* **Information b:** The city's population demographics tell us the general likelihood of someone being male or female, which is important as a baseline.

**Calculating the Probability**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement:

P(Male | Witness says Male) = [P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says Male)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(Witness says Male | Male):**  This is the probability the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is 80% (given in information a).
* **P(Male):** This is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 15% (given in information b).
* **P(Witness says Male):** This is the probability of the witness saying "male" regardless of the actual gender. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:

   P(Witness says Male) = P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness says Male | Female) * P(Female) 

   * P(Witness says Male | Female) = 20% (the chance of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)
   * P(Female) = 85% (from information b)

**Calculations**

1. **P(Witness says Male):** (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

2. **P(Male | Witness says Male):** (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
