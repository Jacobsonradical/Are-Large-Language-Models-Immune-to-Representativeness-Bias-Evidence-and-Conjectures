Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender given the witness's testimony. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B):  The probability of event A happening given that event B has happened. In our case, the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.
* P(B|A): The probability of event B happening given that event A has happened. In our case, the probability the witness would identify someone as male given that they are actually male.
* P(A): The prior probability of event A happening. In our case, the probability that the attacker is male (15%).
* P(B): The probability of event B happening. This is the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as male, which we need to calculate.

**2. Calculate P(B)**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male and the probability of incorrectly identifying a female as male:

* P(witness identifies male | male): 0.80 (from the information provided)
* P(witness identifies male | female): 0.20 (from the information provided)

P(B) = [P(witness identifies male | male) * P(male)] + [P(witness identifies male | female) * P(female)] 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) 
P(B) = 0.28

**3. Calculate P(A|B)**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(attacker is male | witness identified as male) = [(0.80 * 0.15) / 0.28]
                                                 = 0.43 (approximately)

**Answer:** {probability: 0.43}
