Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness claims the attacker was male, but their accuracy is limited.
* **Population Demographics:**  The city has a higher percentage of females.

We need to combine these to estimate the probability the attacker was actually male.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness testimony). It looks like this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A (attacker is male) given evidence B (witness said male). This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): Probability of evidence B (witness said male) given event A (attacker is male). This is the witness's accuracy (80%).
* P(A): Prior probability of event A (attacker is male). This is the population proportion of males (15%).
* P(B): Probability of evidence B (witness said male). This requires a bit more calculation.

**Calculating P(B)**

To get P(B), we need to consider the probability of the witness saying "male" in two scenarios:

1. **The attacker is actually male:** This probability is P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
2. **The attacker is actually female:** This probability is P(B|¬A) * P(¬A).  P(B|¬A) is the witness's error rate (20%), and P(¬A) is the proportion of females (85%), giving us 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, P(B) is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Finally, we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness said Male) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                                          ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
