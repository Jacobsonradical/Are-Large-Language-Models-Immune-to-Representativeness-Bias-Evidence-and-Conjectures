Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given by "a").

**2. Likelihood:**

* The likelihood of the witness identifying someone as male, given they are actually male, is 80% (given by "b").
* The likelihood of the witness identifying someone as male, given they are actually female, is 20% (given by "b").

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior probability based on new evidence. Here's how it applies:

* **P(Male | Witness Male):**  Probability of the attacker being male given the witness identified them as male.
* **P(Witness Male | Male):**  Likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male (80%).
* **P(Male):** Prior probability of the attacker being male (15%).
* **P(Witness Male | Female):** Likelihood of the witness identifying a female as male (20%).
* **P(Female):** Prior probability of the attacker being female (85%).

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(Male | Witness Male) = [P(Witness Male | Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Witness Male | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness Male | Female) * P(Female)]

P(Male | Witness Male) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)

P(Male | Witness Male) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(Male | Witness Male) â‰ˆ 0.414
```

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414.**

**{probability: 0.414}**
