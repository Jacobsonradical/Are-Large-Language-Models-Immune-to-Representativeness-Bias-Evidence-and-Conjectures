Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender given the witness's testimony and the population demographics. 

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our problem**

Let's define our events:

* A: The attacker is male.
* B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is male (80% accuracy).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being male (15% of the population).
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This requires calculating the probability of a male being identified as male AND the probability of a female being incorrectly identified as male, then summing them.

**Calculating P(B)**

* P(male identified as male) = P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
* P(female identified as male) = P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
* P(B) = P(male identified as male) + P(female identified as male) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
