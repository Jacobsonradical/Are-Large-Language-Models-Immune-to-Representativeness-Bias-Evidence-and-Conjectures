Here's how we can estimate the probability of the attacker being male:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. We want to calculate the probability of the attacker being male (our hypothesis) given the witness's testimony (our evidence).

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our Case**

Let's define our events:

* A: The attacker is male.
* B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

Now, we need to find the probabilities for each component:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male, which is the percentage of males in the city, 15% (0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
   * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculating P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.46 or 46%.**
