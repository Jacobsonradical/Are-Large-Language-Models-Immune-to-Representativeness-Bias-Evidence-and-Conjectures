Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Understand Bayes' Theorem:**

This problem requires Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. The formula is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B):  The probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A): The probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A): The prior probability of event A.
* P(B): The prior probability of event B.

**2. Define our events:**

* Event A: The attacker is male.
* Event B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

**3. Determine the probabilities:**

* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being male = 0.15 (given in the problem)
* P(B|A): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is male = 0.80 (given in the problem)
* P(B|not A): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is female = 0.20 (given in the problem)
* P(not A): Prior probability of the attacker being female = 0.85 (given in the problem)

**4. Calculate P(B):**

We need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male regardless of their gender. We can do this using the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness identified them as male:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:** {probability: 0.41}
