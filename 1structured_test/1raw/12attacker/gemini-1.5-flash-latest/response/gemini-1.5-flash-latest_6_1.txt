Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the proportion of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2. Likelihood:**

* The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male is 80% or 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy).
* The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually female is 20% or 0.2 (from the witness's error rate).

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on new evidence. 

* Let:
    * A = Attacker is male
    * B = Witness identified the attacker as male

* The formula is: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

* We need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**4. Calculation:**

* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.38%.
