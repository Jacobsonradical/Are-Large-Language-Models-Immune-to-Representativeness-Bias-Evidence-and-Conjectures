Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (from information "a").

**2.  Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is male:** 80% (from information "b")
* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is female:** 20% (from information "b", as they err 20% of the time).

**3.  Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony:

```
P(Male | Witness says Male) = [P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says Male)
```

Where:

* **P(Male | Witness says Male):** The probability the attacker is male given the witness said male (what we want to find).
* **P(Witness says Male | Male):** The likelihood of the witness saying male given the attacker is male (80%).
* **P(Male):** The prior probability of the attacker being male (15%).
* **P(Witness says Male):**  The overall probability of the witness saying male, calculated using the law of total probability:
    *  P(Witness says Male) = P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness says Male | Female) * P(Female)
    *  P(Witness says Male) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculation:**

Plugging the values into Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(Male | Witness says Male) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
                                    = 0.4138 
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
