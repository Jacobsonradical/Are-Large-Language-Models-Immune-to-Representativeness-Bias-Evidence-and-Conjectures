Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the proportion of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is male:** This is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is female:** This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's testimony:

* **P(Male | Witness says male) = [P(Witness says male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says male)**

Where:

* P(Male | Witness says male): Probability of attacker being male given the witness said male.
* P(Witness says male | Male): Likelihood of the witness saying "male" given the attacker is male (0.8).
* P(Male): Prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15).
* P(Witness says male): Probability of the witness saying "male" (we'll calculate this below).

**4. Calculating P(Witness says male):**

To find P(Witness says male), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is male:** P(Witness says male | Male) * P(Male) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2: Attacker is female:** P(Witness says male | Female) * P(Female) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(Witness says male) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**5. Calculating the Posterior Probability:**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

* P(Male | Witness says male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 41.4%.**
