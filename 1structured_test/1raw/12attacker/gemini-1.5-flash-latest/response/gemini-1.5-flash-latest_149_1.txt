Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding Bayes' Theorem**

This problem requires us to use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence.  

* **Prior Probability:**  The initial probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being male) before considering any new evidence. This is 15% based on the city's population.
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the new evidence (the witness identifying the attacker as male) given that a specific event is true (the attacker is male or female).
* **Posterior Probability:** The updated probability of the event after considering the new evidence. This is what we want to calculate.

**Calculations**

Let's define the events:

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(W|M):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male. This is 80% based on the witness's accuracy.
* **P(M):** The prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 15%.
* **P(W):** The overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
    * P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
