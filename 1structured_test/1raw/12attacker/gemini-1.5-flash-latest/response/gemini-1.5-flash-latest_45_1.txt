Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let 'M' be the event that the attacker is male.
*  Let 'W' be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

**2.  Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:  P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

* **P(M|W):**  The probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male (what we want to find).
* **P(W|M):** The probability the witness identifies someone as male given they are actually male (80% from the information).
* **P(M):** The prior probability of the attacker being male (15% from the information).
* **P(W):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as male (this needs to be calculated).

**3. Calculate P(W):**

We use the law of total probability:

* P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
* P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)  
* P(W) = 0.26

**4. Calculate P(M|W):**

* P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.26
* P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.462

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.462}
