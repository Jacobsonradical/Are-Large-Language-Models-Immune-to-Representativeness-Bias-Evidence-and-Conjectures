Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is not perfect and has a chance of being wrong.
* **Population Demographics:**  The city has a higher percentage of women than men.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness testimony):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):**  Probability of the attacker being male (A) given the witness's identification (B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (B) given the attacker is actually male (A). This is the witness's accuracy (80%).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being male. This is the percentage of males in the city (15%).
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (regardless of the attacker's actual gender). This requires a bit more calculation.

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is Male:** P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2: Attacker is Female:** P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (where A' means the attacker is not male)

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness said Male) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
