Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the percentage of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2.  Likelihood:**

* The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male, is 80% or 0.8 (the witness's accuracy).
* The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually female, is 20% or 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

**3.  Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on new evidence (the witness's testimony). 

Let:

*  A =  The attacker is male
*  B =  The witness identifies the attacker as male

The formula is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of the attacker being male given the witness identified them as male. This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male (0.8).
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15).
* P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (this can be calculated using the law of total probability).

**Calculating P(B):**

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
   * P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (probability of witness identifying as male when it's female)
   * P(¬A) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being female)
* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
