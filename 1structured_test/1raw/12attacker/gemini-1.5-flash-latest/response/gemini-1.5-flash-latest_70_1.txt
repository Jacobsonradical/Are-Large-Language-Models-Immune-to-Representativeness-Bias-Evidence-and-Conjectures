Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (15% of the population is male)
* **P(F) = 0.85** (85% of the population is female)

**3. Conditional Probabilities (from the witness's accuracy):**

* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (Probability of witness identifying male correctly)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (Probability of witness incorrectly identifying female as male)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(M|W)**, the probability the attacker is male given the witness's identification. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

**5. Calculations:**

* P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
