Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** The city's population distribution tells us the prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (0.15).
* **Likelihood:** The witness's accuracy provides the likelihood of observing the event (witness identifying the attacker as male) given different scenarios:
    * **If the attacker is male:** The witness is correct 80% of the time.
    * **If the attacker is female:** The witness is incorrect 20% of the time (because they correctly identify females 80% of the time).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B):  The probability of the attacker being male (A) given the witness's identification (B). This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is male (80% or 0.8).
* P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being male (15% or 0.15).
* P(B): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This needs to be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness said Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer**

{probability: 0.46}
