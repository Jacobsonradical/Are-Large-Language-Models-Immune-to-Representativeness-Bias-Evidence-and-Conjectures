Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(M) = 0.15:**  The probability of a randomly chosen person in the city being male (given from the information).
* **P(F) = 0.85:** The probability of a randomly chosen person in the city being female.

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities)**

* **P(W|M) = 0.8:** The probability of the witness identifying a male as male (80% accuracy).
* **P(W|F) = 0.2:** The probability of the witness identifying a female as male (20% error rate).

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

**5. Calculation**

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(M|W) = 0.4

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4}
