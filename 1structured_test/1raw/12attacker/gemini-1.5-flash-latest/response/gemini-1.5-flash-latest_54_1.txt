Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in information "a").

**2.  Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is male:** 80% (given in information "b").
* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is female:** 20% (given in information "b", since the witness is wrong 20% of the time).

**3.  Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony:

P(Male | Witness said "male") = [P(Witness said "male" | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness said "male")

To calculate P(Witness said "male"), we need the law of total probability:

P(Witness said "male") = [P(Witness said "male" | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness said "male" | Female) * P(Female)]

**4.  Calculation:**

* P(Witness said "male" | Male) = 0.8
* P(Male) = 0.15
* P(Witness said "male" | Female) = 0.2
* P(Female) = 0.85

P(Witness said "male") = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Male | Witness said "male") = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414}
