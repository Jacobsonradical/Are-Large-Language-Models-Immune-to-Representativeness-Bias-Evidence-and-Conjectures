Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in "a").

**2. Likelihood:**

* The likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is 80% (given in "b").
* The likelihood of the witness identifying a female as male is 20% (given in "b").

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief based on new evidence:

P(Male | Witness said Male) = [P(Witness said Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness said Male)

To calculate the denominator, P(Witness said Male), we need to consider both cases:

* **Case 1: Attacker is Male:** P(Witness said Male | Male) * P(Male) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Case 2: Attacker is Female:** P(Witness said Male | Female) * P(Female) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(Witness said Male) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Calculation:**

P(Male | Witness said Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
