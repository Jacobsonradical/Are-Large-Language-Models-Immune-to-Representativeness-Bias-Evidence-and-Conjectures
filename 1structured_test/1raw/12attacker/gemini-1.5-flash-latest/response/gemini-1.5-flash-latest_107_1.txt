Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have a prior belief about the population (85% female, 15% male). We then get new evidence from a witness who has a certain accuracy in identifying gender. We need to update our belief about the attacker's gender based on this new information.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B):  The probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find)
* P(B|A): The probability of event B happening given that event A has happened
* P(A): The prior probability of event A happening
* P(B): The prior probability of event B happening

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is male.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**Let's plug in the values:**

* **P(A):**  0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being male)
* **P(B|A):** 0.80 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male)
* **P(B|not A):** 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)
* **P(not A):** 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being female)

**To calculate P(B), we need the law of total probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
