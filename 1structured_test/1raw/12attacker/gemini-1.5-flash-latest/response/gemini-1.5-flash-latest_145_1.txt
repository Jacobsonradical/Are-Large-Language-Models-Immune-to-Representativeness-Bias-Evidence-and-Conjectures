Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the percentage of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of the witness saying "male" given the attacker is actually male:** 80% or 0.8 (witness is correct)
* **Likelihood of the witness saying "male" given the attacker is actually female:** 20% or 0.2 (witness is incorrect)

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on new evidence (the witness's statement).  The formula is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of A given B (the probability the attacker is male given the witness said male)
* P(B|A) = Probability of B given A (likelihood of the witness saying "male" given the attacker is male)
* P(A) = Prior probability of A (the probability of the attacker being male)
* P(B) = Probability of B (the probability of the witness saying "male", which we need to calculate)

**4. Calculate P(B):**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness is correct if attacker is male)
* P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of attacker being male)
* P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness is incorrect if attacker is female)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability of attacker being female)

Therefore: 
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**5. Calculate P(A|B):**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Therefore, based on the witness's statement, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 46.15%.**
