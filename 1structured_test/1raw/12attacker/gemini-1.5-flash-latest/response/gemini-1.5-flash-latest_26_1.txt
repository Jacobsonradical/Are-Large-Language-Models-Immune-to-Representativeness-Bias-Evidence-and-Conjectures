Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the proportion of males in the city: 15% or 0.15

**2.  Likelihood:**

* The likelihood of the witness identifying someone as male, given they are actually male: 80% or 0.8
* The likelihood of the witness identifying someone as male, given they are actually female: 20% or 0.2

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's testimony.

* **Let A = Attacker is Male**
* **Let B = Witness identifies the attacker as male**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of the attacker being male given the witness identified them as male (what we want to find)
* P(B|A) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as male given they are male (likelihood) = 0.8
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being male = 0.15
* P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as male (we need to calculate this)

**Calculating P(B):**

P(B) can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)

* P(B| not A) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as male given they are female = 0.2
* P(not A) = Prior probability of the attacker not being male = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Finally, calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.462

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.462}
