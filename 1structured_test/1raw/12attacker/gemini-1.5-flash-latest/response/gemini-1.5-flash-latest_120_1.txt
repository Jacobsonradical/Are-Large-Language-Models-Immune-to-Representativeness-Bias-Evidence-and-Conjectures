Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (From "a", 15% of the population is male)
* **P(F) = 0.85** (From "a", 85% of the population is female)

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (From "b", witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (From "b", witness incorrectly identifies female as male 20% of the time)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

**5. Calculation:**

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(M|W) = 0.4

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4}
