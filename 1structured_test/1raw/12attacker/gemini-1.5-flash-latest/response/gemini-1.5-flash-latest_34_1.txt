Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in "a").

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is actually male:** 80% (from "b").
* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is actually female:** 20% (from "b", since the witness is wrong 20% of the time).

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's statement:

P(Male | Witness said Male) = [P(Witness said Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness said Male)

Where:

* P(Male | Witness said Male) is the probability the attacker is male given the witness said male. 
* P(Witness said Male | Male) is the likelihood of the witness saying "male" given the attacker is actually male (80%).
* P(Male) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (15%).
* P(Witness said Male) is the overall probability of the witness saying "male", which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability: 
    * P(Witness said Male) = P(Witness said Male | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness said Male | Female) * P(Female)
    * P(Witness said Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculation:**

P(Male | Witness said Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
