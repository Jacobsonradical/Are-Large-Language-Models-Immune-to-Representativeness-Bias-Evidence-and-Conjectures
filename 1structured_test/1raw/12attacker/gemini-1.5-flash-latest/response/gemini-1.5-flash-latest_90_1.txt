Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male, considering both the population demographics and the witness's reliability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the proportion of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2. Likelihood:**

* The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given the attacker is actually male, is 80% or 0.8 (the witness's accuracy).
* The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given the attacker is actually female, is 20% or 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on the new evidence from the witness:

P(Male | Witness Male) = [P(Witness Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness Male)

To calculate P(Witness Male), we need to consider both possibilities:

P(Witness Male) = [P(Witness Male | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness Male | Female) * P(Female)]
P(Witness Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**4. Final Calculation:**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Male | Witness Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 
P(Male | Witness Male) â‰ˆ 0.43

**Answer:** {probability: 0.43} 

Therefore, based on the information given, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.43 or 43%.
