Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. We want to find the probability of the attacker being male (event A) given the witness's testimony (event B).

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A (attacker being male) given event B (witness's testimony).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B (witness's testimony) given event A (attacker being male).
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A (the base population percentage of males).
* P(B) is the overall probability of event B (the witness identifying a gender).

**Let's break down the information:**

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male is 0.80 (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|~A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.20 (20% error rate).
* **P(~A):** The prior probability of the attacker being female is 0.85 (85% of the population).

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to find the overall probability of the witness identifying a gender, which can happen in two ways:

* Witness identifies a male correctly: P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* Witness identifies a female incorrectly: P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
