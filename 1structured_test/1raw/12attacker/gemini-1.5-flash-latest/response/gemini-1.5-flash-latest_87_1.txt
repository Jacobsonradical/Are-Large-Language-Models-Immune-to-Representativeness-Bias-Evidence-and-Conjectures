Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **M:**  The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**We know the following:**

* **P(M) = 0.15:** The prior probability of a person being male in the city.
* **P(F) = 0.85:** The prior probability of a person being female in the city.
* **P(W|M) = 0.80:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male.
* **P(W|F) = 0.20:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male.

**We want to find P(M|W):** The probability the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

**Calculations:**

1. **Calculate P(W):**
   P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.26

2. **Calculate P(M|W):**
   P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.4615}
