Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two sources of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness has a certain accuracy in identifying gender, but they're not perfect.
* **Population Demographics:**  The city's population has a known gender distribution.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence:

* **P(A|B):** The probability of the attacker being male (A) given the witness's identification (B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as male given they actually are male (80% accuracy).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male (15% from the population).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as male (we'll calculate this).

**Calculating P(B)**

To get P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** The attacker is male (P(A) = 0.15) and the witness correctly identifies them (P(B|A) = 0.8). This contributes 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 to P(B).
* **Scenario 2:** The attacker is female (P(~A) = 0.85) and the witness incorrectly identifies them as male (P(B|~A) = 0.2). This contributes 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 to P(B).

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Now we can plug in the values:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
