Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony.  

* **Prior probability:** The initial probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in "a").
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as male, given that they are actually male (80% from "b").
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define:

*  M = Attacker is Male
*  W = Witness identifies the attacker as male

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(M|W) = Probability of the attacker being male, given the witness identified them as male (what we want to find)
* P(W|M) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as male, given they are male (80%)
* P(M) = Prior probability of the attacker being male (15%)
* P(W) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as male (we need to calculate this)

**Calculating P(W)**

To find P(W), we need to consider both scenarios:

1. **Witness is correct:**  P(W|M) * P(M) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
2. **Witness is incorrect:** P(W|F) * P(F) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 

**Calculating P(M|W)**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
