Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is generally accurate at identifying gender (80% success rate), but they made an error 20% of the time.
* **Population Demographics:**  The city has a significantly larger female population (85%) compared to males (15%).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the evidence. 

Let's define:

* **A:** The event that the attacker is male.
* **B:** The event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
```

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male *given* the attacker is male. This is the witness's accuracy rate: 0.80
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being male. This is the proportion of males in the city: 0.15
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker actually being male is still relatively low (around 41.4%). This is because the city has a significantly higher proportion of females.
