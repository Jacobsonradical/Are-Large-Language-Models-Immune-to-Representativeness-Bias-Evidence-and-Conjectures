Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (based on the city's population distribution).

**2. Likelihood:**

* The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given the attacker is actually male, is 80% (witness's accuracy).
* The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given the attacker is actually female, is 20% (witness's error rate).

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on new evidence:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
```

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of the attacker being male (A) given the witness's identification (B).
* P(B|A): The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is male.
* P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being male.
* P(B): The overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (this can be calculated using the law of total probability).

**Calculation:**

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness accuracy)
* P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability)
* P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness error rate)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability of attacker being female)

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
* P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
