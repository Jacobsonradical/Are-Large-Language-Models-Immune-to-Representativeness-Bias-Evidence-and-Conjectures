Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1.  Understanding Bayes' Theorem**

This problem involves conditional probability, which is best addressed using Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) = Prior probability of event B happening.

**2. Defining Events**

* **A:** The attacker is male.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**3. Gathering Information**

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in information "a").
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male is 80% (given in information "b").
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually female is 20% (since the witness is correct 80% of the time, they are incorrect 20% of the time).

**4. Calculating P(B)**

To use Bayes' Theorem, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.28

**5. Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.28 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.43 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.43}
