Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** 15% of the population is male. This is our initial belief about the attacker's gender before considering the witness's testimony.
* **Likelihood:** The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. This is the likelihood of observing the witness's testimony (saying the attacker is male) given that the attacker is actually male.
* **Bayes' Theorem:** We'll use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender after considering the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define some events:

*  M: The attacker is male.
*  F: The attacker is female.
*  W: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(M|W): The probability the attacker is male given the witness said male. This is what we want to calculate.
* P(W|M): The probability the witness says male given the attacker is male (this is 0.8).
* P(M): The prior probability of the attacker being male (this is 0.15).
* P(W): The probability of the witness saying male (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(W)**

To get P(W), we need to consider both scenarios: the attacker being male and the attacker being female.

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is male:**  P(W|M) * P(M) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2: Attacker is female:** P(W|F) * P(F) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 
   *  P(W|F) is the probability of the witness saying male given the attacker is female, which is 20% (the error rate).
   *  P(F) is the prior probability of the attacker being female (0.85).

Now, P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating P(M|W)**

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
