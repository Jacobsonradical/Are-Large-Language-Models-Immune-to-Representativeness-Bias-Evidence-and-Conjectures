Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the percentage of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male:** 80% or 0.8
* **Likelihood of the witness identifying a female as male:** 20% or 0.2

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the updated probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony:

```
P(Male | Witness says male) = [P(Witness says male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says male)
```

Where:

* P(Male | Witness says male) = Probability of the attacker being male given the witness said male.
* P(Witness says male | Male) = Likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male (0.8).
* P(Male) = Prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15).
* P(Witness says male) = Probability of the witness saying male, which can happen in two ways:
    * Witness says male and attacker is male: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * Witness says male and attacker is female: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
    *  P(Witness says male) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Calculation:**

```
P(Male | Witness says male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                                  = 0.12 / 0.29
                                  â‰ˆ 0.414
```

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 41.4%.**
