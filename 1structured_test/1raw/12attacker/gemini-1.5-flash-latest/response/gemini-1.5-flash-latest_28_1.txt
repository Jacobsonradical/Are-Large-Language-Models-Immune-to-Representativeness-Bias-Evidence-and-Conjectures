Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1.  Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic Bayesian inference problem. We want to update our belief about the attacker's gender (male) given the evidence from the witness.

**2. Setting Up Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (what we want to find - probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony)
* P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (probability of the witness identifying a male correctly)
* P(A) is the prior probability of A (probability of a person in the city being male)
* P(B) is the probability of B (probability of the witness identifying a gender, regardless of the actual gender)

**3.  Applying the Information**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of the attacker being male, based on the city's demographics)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (Prior probability of the attacker being female)

**4. Calculating P(B)**

To get P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) 
P(B) = 0.29

**5. Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414.**
