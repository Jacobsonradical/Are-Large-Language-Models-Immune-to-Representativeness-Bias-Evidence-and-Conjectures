Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** The witness is not perfect. They have a chance of being wrong about the attacker's gender. We need to consider this error rate.
* **Information b:** The population distribution of males and females in the city is important. There's a higher chance the attacker is female simply because there are more females.

**Calculating the Probability**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony.

* **Let A be the event that the attacker is male.**
* **Let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as male *given* the attacker is actually male. This is 80% (from the witness's accuracy).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 15% (from the city's population distribution).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as male (regardless of the actual gender). We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
