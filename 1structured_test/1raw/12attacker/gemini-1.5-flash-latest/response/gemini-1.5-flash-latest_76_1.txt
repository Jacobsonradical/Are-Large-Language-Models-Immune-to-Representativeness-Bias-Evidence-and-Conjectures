Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **M:**  Attacker is male.
* **F:** Attacker is female.
* **W:** Witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (15% of the population is male)
* **P(F) = 0.85** (85% of the population is female)

**3. Conditional Probabilities (based on witness accuracy):**

* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (Witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (Witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's statement:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Where P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, calculated using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

**5. Calculations:**

* P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**6. Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
