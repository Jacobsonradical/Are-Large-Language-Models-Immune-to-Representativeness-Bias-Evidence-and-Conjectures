Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male, using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is male.
*  **B:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** The probability of the attacker being male (based on the city's population) = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** The probability of the attacker being female = 0.85

**3. Conditional Probabilities:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male = 0.80 (witness accuracy)
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male = 0.20 (witness error)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41 

**Answer:** {probability: 0.41}
