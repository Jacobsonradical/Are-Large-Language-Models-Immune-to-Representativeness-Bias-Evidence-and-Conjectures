Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **M:** The attacker is male.
*  **F:** The attacker is female.
*  **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(M) = 0.15 (From information "a", 15% of the population is male)
*  P(F) = 0.85 (From information "a", 85% of the population is female)

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

*  P(W|M) = 0.80 (From information "b", the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
*  P(W|F) = 0.20 (From information "b", the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

**5. Calculate:**

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414}
