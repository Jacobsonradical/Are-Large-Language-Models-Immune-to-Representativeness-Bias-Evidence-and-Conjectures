Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness's identification. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

**3. Calculate Components:**

* **P(W|M):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given they are male. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(M):** The prior probability of the attacker being male, which is the proportion of males in the city, 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as male (regardless of the attacker's actual gender).  We can calculate this using the law of total probability: 
    * P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F) 
    * P(W|F) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(F) is the proportion of females in the city, 85% or 0.85.
    * So, P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**4. Calculate P(M|W):**

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
