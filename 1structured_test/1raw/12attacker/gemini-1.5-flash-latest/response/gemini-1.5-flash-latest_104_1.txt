Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. We want to find the probability of the attacker being male (given the witness testimony and population demographics). 

**Terminology**

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of an event before any new information is considered (e.g., the probability of a randomly chosen person being male in the city).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of observing the evidence given a specific event (e.g., the probability of the witness identifying someone as male given that they are actually male).
* **Posterior Probability:** The probability of an event after considering new information (e.g., the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony).

**Calculations**

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   *  P(Male) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is male)
   *  P(Female) = 0.85 (85% of the city's population is female)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   *  P(Witness says Male | Male) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
   *  P(Witness says Male | Female) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**

   P(Male | Witness says Male) = [P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says Male)

   To calculate P(Witness says Male), we use the law of total probability:

   P(Witness says Male) = P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness says Male | Female) * P(Female)
   P(Witness says Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

   Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

   P(Male | Witness says Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony and population demographics, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
