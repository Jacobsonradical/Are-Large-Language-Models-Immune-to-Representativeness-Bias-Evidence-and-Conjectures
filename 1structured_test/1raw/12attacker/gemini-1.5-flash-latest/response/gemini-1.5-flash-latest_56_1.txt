Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the proportion of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2.  Likelihood:**

* The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male *given* the attacker is male is 80% or 0.8.
* The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male *given* the attacker is female is 20% or 0.2 (since they err 20% of the time).

**3.  Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on new evidence:

P(Male | Witness Male) = [P(Witness Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness Male)

Where:

* P(Male | Witness Male) is the probability the attacker is male given the witness said they were male.
* P(Witness Male | Male) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male (0.8).
* P(Male) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15).
* P(Witness Male) is the overall probability of the witness saying the attacker is male, which we need to calculate.

**4.  Calculating P(Witness Male):**

We use the law of total probability:

P(Witness Male) = P(Witness Male | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness Male | Female) * P(Female)
P(Witness Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5.  Final Calculation:**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Male | Witness Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(Male | Witness Male) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
