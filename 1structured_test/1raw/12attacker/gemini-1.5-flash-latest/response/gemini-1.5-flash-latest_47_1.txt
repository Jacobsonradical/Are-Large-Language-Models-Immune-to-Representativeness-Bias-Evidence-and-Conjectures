Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We want to find the probability the attacker is male (let's call this event "M") given that the witness identified the attacker as male (let's call this event "W").  In other words, we want P(M|W).

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|M):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as male given they are actually male. This is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(M):** The prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 15% (0.15) based on the city's population.
* **P(W):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as male, regardless of their actual gender. We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(W)**

We can use the Law of Total Probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

* **P(W|F):** The probability the witness identifies someone as male given they are actually female. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% (0.2).
* **P(F):** The prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 85% (0.85).

Plugging in the values:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Calculating P(M|W)**

Now we have all the pieces to use Bayes' Theorem:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
