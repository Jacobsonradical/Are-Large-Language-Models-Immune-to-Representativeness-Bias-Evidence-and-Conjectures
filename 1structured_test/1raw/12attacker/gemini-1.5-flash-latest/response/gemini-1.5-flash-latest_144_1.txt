Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**We need to find:** P(M | W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.

**We are given:**

* P(W | M) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
* P(W | F) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
* P(M) = 0.15 (The prior probability of a male in the city)
* P(F) = 0.85 (The prior probability of a female in the city)

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(M | W) = [P(W | M) * P(M)] / P(W)

**To calculate P(W), we use the Law of Total Probability:**

P(W) = P(W | M) * P(M) + P(W | F) * P(F)
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Now we can calculate P(M | W):**

P(M | W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.4615}
