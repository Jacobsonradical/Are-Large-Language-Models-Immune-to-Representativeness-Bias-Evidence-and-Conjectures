Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the percentage of males in the city: 15% or 0.15

**2.  Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is male:** 80% or 0.8 (the witness is correct)
* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is female:** 20% or 0.2 (the witness is incorrect)

**3.  Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief based on new evidence:

P(Male | Witness said Male) = [P(Witness said Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness said Male)

Where:

* P(Male | Witness said Male) = Probability of the attacker being male given the witness said "male" (what we want to find)
* P(Witness said Male | Male) = Likelihood of the witness saying "male" given the attacker is male (0.8)
* P(Male) = Prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15)
* P(Witness said Male) = Probability of the witness saying "male" (calculated below)

**4.  Calculating P(Witness said Male):**

We need to consider both scenarios:

* P(Witness said Male | Male) * P(Male) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* P(Witness said Male | Female) * P(Female) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

P(Witness said Male) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**5.  Putting it together:**

P(Male | Witness said Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 41.38%.**
