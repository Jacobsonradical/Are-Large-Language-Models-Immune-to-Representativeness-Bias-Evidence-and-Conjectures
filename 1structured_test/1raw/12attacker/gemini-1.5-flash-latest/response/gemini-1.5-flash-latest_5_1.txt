Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

**1. Define Events:**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:  P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(M|W):**  The probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male (this is what we want to find).
* **P(W|M):** The probability the witness identifies someone as male given they are actually male (80% accuracy).
* **P(M):**  The prior probability the attacker is male (15% of the population).
* **P(W):** The probability the witness identifies someone as male (this needs to be calculated).

**3. Calculate P(W):**

We need to consider both scenarios where the witness is correct and incorrect:

* **P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)** 
    * P(W|M) = 0.8 (witness is correct)
    * P(M) = 0.15
    * P(W|F) = 0.2 (witness is incorrect)
    * P(F) = 0.85

Therefore: P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(M|W):**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414}
