Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, meaning they are wrong 20% of the time.
* **Population Demographics:** The city has a higher proportion of females (85%) compared to males (15%).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem can be solved using Bayes' Theorem.  Let's define the events:

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(W|M):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male *given* the attacker is male. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(M):**  Prior probability of the attacker being male, which is the proportion of males in the population, 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (regardless of the attacker's actual gender). This requires a bit more calculation, using the law of total probability:

    P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F) 
    Where F is the event that the attacker is female. 

    * P(W|F) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male, which is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(F) is the proportion of females in the population, 85% or 0.85.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(W):**
   P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Calculate P(M|W):**
   P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.48 or 48%.**
