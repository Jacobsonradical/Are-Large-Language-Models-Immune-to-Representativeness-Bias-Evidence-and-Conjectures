Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the proportion of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying male given attacker is male:**  80% (witness is correct)
* **Likelihood of witness saying male given attacker is female:** 20% (witness is wrong)

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony. 

Let:

* A = Attacker is male
* B = Witness identified attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios (attacker is male and attacker is female):

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)] 
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.4%.**
