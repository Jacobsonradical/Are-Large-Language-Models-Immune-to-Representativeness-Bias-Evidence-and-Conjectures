Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the percentage of males in the city: 15% or 0.15

**2. Likelihood Ratios:**

* **Likelihood of the evidence given the attacker is male:** The witness correctly identified a male as male 80% of the time.
* **Likelihood of the evidence given the attacker is female:** The witness incorrectly identified a female as male 20% of the time.

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on new evidence:

P(Male | Witness said male) = [P(Witness said male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness said male)

Where:

* P(Male | Witness said male) is the probability the attacker is male given the witness said male.
* P(Witness said male | Male) is the likelihood of the witness saying male given the attacker is male (0.8).
* P(Male) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15).
* P(Witness said male) is the overall probability of the witness saying male, which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

   P(Witness said male) = [P(Witness said male | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness said male | Female) * P(Female)]
   P(Witness said male) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculation:**

P(Male | Witness said male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
