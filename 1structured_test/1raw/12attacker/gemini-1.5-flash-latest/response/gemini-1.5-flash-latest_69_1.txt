Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

**3. Break Down the Components**

* **P(W|M):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as male given they are actually male (this is the witness's accuracy).  P(W|M) = 0.8
* **P(M):** Prior probability of the attacker being male (based on the city's population). P(M) = 0.15
* **P(W):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as male (this can be calculated using the law of total probability). 
    * P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**4. Calculate P(M|W)**

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
