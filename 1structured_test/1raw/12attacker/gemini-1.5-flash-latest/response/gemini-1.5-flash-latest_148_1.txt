Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let 'M' be the event that the attacker is male.
*  Let 'W' be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2.  Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states: 

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(M|W) = Probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male. (This is what we want to find)
* P(W|M) = Probability the witness identifies someone as male given they are actually male (80% from the information).
* P(M) = Prior probability of the attacker being male (15% from the population information).
* P(W) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as male (this needs to be calculated).

**3. Calculate P(W)**

We can use the Law of Total Probability to find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

* P(W|F) = Probability the witness identifies someone as male given they are female (20% from the information).
* P(F) = Prior probability of the attacker being female (85% from the population information).

Therefore:

P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(M|W)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
