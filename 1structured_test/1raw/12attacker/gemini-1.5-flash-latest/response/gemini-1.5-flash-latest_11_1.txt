Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **M:** The attacker is male.
*  **F:** The attacker is female.
*  **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. Given Information:**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (15% of the population is male)
* **P(F) = 0.85** (85% of the population is female)
* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (Witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (Witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

To find P(W), the probability the witness identifies the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

**4. Calculation:**

* P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 (approximately)

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4138}
