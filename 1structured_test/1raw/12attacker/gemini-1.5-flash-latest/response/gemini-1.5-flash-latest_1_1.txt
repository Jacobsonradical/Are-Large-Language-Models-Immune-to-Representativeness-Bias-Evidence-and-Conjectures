Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **M:** Attacker is male.
* **F:** Attacker is female.
* **W:** Witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* P(M) = 0.15 (from "a")
* P(F) = 0.85 (from "a")

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

* P(W|M) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies male)
* P(W|F) = 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies female as male)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

To find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

**5. Calculation:**

* P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.26
* P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
