Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:**  85% of the city's population is female, and 15% is male. This is our prior belief about the attacker's gender before considering the witness's testimony.
* **Witness Accuracy:** The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and makes mistakes 20% of the time.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior belief based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):** The probability of the attacker being male (A) given the witness's testimony (B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male (true positive). This is 80% (witness accuracy).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male (15%).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (regardless of their actual gender). This is the tricky part, as it requires considering both true positives and false positives.

**Calculating P(B)**

To get P(B), we need to account for both cases where the witness is correct and incorrect:

* **Witness is correct:**  
    * Probability of attacker being male AND witness being correct: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
* **Witness is incorrect:** 
    * Probability of attacker being female AND witness saying male: 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(Male|Witness said Male) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker is male increases from 15% (prior) to about 41%. While this is a significant increase, it's important to note that the probability is still less than 50%. This emphasizes the limitations of eyewitness testimony, especially in conditions where accurate gender identification is difficult.
