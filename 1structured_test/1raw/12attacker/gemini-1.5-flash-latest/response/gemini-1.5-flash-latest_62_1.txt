Here's how to approach this problem, which is a classic example of Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events:**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (From information "a", 15% of the population is male)
* **P(F) = 0.85** (From information "a", 85% of the population is female)

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (From information "b", the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (From information "b", the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness's testimony. Bayes' Theorem states:

```
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)
```

Where P(W) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, calculated using the law of total probability:

```
P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
```

**5. Calculation:**

* **P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**
* **P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138** (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
