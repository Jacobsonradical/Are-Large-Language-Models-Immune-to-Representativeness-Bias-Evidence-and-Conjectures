Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony and the population demographics.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A happening given that event B happened.
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening given that event A happened.
* P(A): Prior probability of event A.
* P(B): Prior probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our Problem:**

Let:

* A: Attacker is male
* B: Witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B): the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.

Here's how to break down the components:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male *given* the attacker is male. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being male. This is the male proportion in the city, 15%.
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (regardless of the attacker's actual gender). This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculating P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
