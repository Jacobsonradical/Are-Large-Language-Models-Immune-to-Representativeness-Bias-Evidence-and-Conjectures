Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **M:** The attacker is male.
*  **F:** The attacker is female.
*  **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. Given Information:**

* **P(F) = 0.85** (85% of the population is female)
* **P(M) = 0.15** (15% of the population is male)
* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (Witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (Witness incorrectly identifies female as male 20% of the time)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(M|W)**, the probability the attacker is male given the witness's identification. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

To calculate P(W), we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

**4. Calculate P(W):**

P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.26

**5. Calculate P(M|W):**

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.462

**Answer:** {probability: 0.462}
