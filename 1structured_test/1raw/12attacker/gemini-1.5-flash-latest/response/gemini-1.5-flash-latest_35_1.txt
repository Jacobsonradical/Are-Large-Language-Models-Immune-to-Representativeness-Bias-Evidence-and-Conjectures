Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic Bayesian inference problem. We need to update our prior belief (the percentage of males in the city) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

**Calculations**

1. **Prior Probability:** The probability of the attacker being male before considering the witness's statement is 0.15 (15% of the population).

2. **Likelihood:**  The probability of the witness identifying someone as male given that they are actually male is 0.8 (80% accuracy).

3. **Likelihood of False Identification:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as male given that they are actually female is 0.2 (20% error rate).

4. **Posterior Probability:** We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the updated probability of the attacker being male:

   P(Male | Witness says Male) = [P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says Male)

   To calculate P(Witness says Male), we need to consider both scenarios (male attacker and female attacker):

   P(Witness says Male) = [P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness says Male | Female) * P(Female)]
   P(Witness says Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

   Now, we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

   P(Male | Witness says Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
   P(Male | Witness says Male) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
