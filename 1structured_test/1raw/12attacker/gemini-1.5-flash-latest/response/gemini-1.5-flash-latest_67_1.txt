Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Prior Probability:** 15% of the population is male. This is our initial belief about the attacker's gender.
* **Witness Testimony:** The witness claims the attacker was male, but their accuracy is only 80%.

**Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony.  

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find)
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define our events:

* **A:** Attacker is male
* **B:** Witness identifies attacker as male

Now, we need to plug in the values:

* **P(A):** 0.15 (Prior probability of attacker being male)
* **P(B|A):** 0.80 (Probability of witness correctly identifying a male as male)
* **P(B| not A):** 0.20 (Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** Attacker is male (A) and witness identifies correctly (B|A):  0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2:** Attacker is female (not A) and witness identifies incorrectly (B|not A): 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

**P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
