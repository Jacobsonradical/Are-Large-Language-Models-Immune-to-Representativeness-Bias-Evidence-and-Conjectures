Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The initial probability of the attacker being male is 15% (based on the city's population distribution). This is our prior probability.

**2. Likelihood:**

* The witness identified the attacker as male. This is our likelihood.
* The witness is accurate 80% of the time, meaning there's an 80% chance they correctly identified a male.

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the updated probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of A given B (the updated probability we want)
* P(B|A) = Probability of B given A (the likelihood)
* P(A) = Prior probability of A
* P(B) = Probability of B (which we'll calculate below)

Let's define our variables:

* A = Attacker is male
* B = Witness identifies the attacker as male

**4. Calculating P(B):**

* P(B) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the actual gender.
* We need to consider both scenarios:
    * Scenario 1: Attacker is male, witness identifies correctly: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
    * Scenario 2: Attacker is female, witness identifies incorrectly: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
* P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**5. Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Attacker is male | Witness says male) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 
                                                 = 0.12 / 0.29
                                                 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
