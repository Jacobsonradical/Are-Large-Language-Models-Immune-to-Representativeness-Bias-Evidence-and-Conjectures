Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (15% of the population is male)
* **P(F) = 0.85** (85% of the population is female)

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness's testimony.

```
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)] 
```

**5. Calculation**

```
P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.414 
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
