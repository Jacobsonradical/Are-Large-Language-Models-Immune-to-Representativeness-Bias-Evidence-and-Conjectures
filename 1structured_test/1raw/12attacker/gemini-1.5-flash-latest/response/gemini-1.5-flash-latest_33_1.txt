Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male, using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (from information "a")
* **P(F) = 0.85** (from information "a")

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (witness correctly identifies a male as male)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

**5. Calculate:**

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(M|W) = 0.40

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.40}
