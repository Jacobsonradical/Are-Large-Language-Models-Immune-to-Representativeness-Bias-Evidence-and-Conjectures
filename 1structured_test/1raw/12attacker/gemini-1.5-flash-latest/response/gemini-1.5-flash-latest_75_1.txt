Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is the percentage of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male:** 80% or 0.8.
* **Likelihood of the witness identifying a female as male:** 20% or 0.2.

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony:

P(Male | Witness says Male) = [P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says Male)

Where:

* P(Male | Witness says Male) is the probability the attacker is male given the witness said male. 
* P(Witness says Male | Male) is the likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male (0.8).
* P(Male) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15).
* P(Witness says Male) is the overall probability of the witness saying male, which we need to calculate.

**4. Calculating P(Witness says Male):**

P(Witness says Male) = [P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness says Male | Female) * P(Female)]

P(Witness says Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**5. Final Calculation:**

P(Male | Witness says Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
