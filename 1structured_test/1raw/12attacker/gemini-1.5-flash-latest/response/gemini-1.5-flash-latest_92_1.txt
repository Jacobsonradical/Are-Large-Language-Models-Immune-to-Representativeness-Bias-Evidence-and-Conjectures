Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** 15% of the city's population is male. This is our prior belief about the attacker's gender before considering the witness testimony.
* **Likelihood:** The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time. This is the likelihood of the witness saying "male" given that the attacker is actually male.
* **False Positive Rate:** The witness incorrectly identified gender 20% of the time. This is the likelihood of the witness saying "male" given that the attacker is actually female.

**2. Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior belief based on new evidence (the witness testimony):

P(Male | Witness said Male) = [P(Witness said Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness said Male)

Where:

* P(Male | Witness said Male): The probability the attacker is male given the witness said "male" (what we want to find).
* P(Witness said Male | Male): The likelihood of the witness saying "male" given the attacker is actually male (80%).
* P(Male): The prior probability of the attacker being male (15%).
* P(Witness said Male): The probability of the witness saying "male" (this can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability).

**3. Calculating P(Witness said Male)**

P(Witness said Male) = [P(Witness said Male | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness said Male | Female) * P(Female)] 
P(Witness said Male) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Plugging into Bayes' Theorem**

P(Male | Witness said Male) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 41.4%.  While the witness's testimony increases the probability from the initial 15%, it's important to remember that the witness has a significant error rate.
