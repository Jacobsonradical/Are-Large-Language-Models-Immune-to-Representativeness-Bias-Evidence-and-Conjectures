Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two sources of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is not perfectly accurate, but has a known accuracy rate.
* **Population Demographics:** The city has a known gender distribution.

We need to combine these pieces of information to estimate the probability of the attacker being male.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of the attacker being male (based on population demographics) is 15%.
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as male given that they are actually male (80%).
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to calculate the **Posterior Probability:** The probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony.

**Calculation**

Let:

*  A = Attacker is Male
*  B = Witness identifies the attacker as male

We need to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down the terms:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male *given* the attacker is male (this is the witness's accuracy rate) = 0.80
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male = 0.15
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (this can be calculated using the law of total probability):
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29 

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

Based on the given information, the estimated probability of the attacker being male is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
