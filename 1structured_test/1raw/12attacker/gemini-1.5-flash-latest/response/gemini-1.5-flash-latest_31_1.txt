Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the proportion of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is male:** 80% (witness is correct)
* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is female:** 20% (witness is incorrect)

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior belief based on new evidence.  It looks like this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (what we want to find)
* P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (likelihood)
* P(A) is the prior probability of A
* P(B) is the probability of B (we need to calculate this)

**Let's define our events:**

* A: Attacker is male
* B: Witness identifies the attacker as male

**Calculating P(B):**

* P(B) is the probability of the witness saying "male". We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**Putting it all together:**

* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
* P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
