Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1.  Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic Bayesian inference problem. We need to update our belief about the attacker's gender (male) given the witness's testimony and the population demographics.

**2.  Setting up the Variables**

*  **M:**  Event that the attacker is male.
*  **F:** Event that the attacker is female.
*  **W:** Event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

**3.  Prior Probabilities**

*  **P(M) = 0.15** (Prior probability of the attacker being male, based on the city's population)
*  **P(F) = 0.85** (Prior probability of the attacker being female)

**4.  Likelihoods**

*  **P(W|M) = 0.80** (Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given they are actually male)
*  **P(W|F) = 0.20** (Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given they are actually female)

**5.  Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.  Bayes' Theorem gives us:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. We can use the Law of Total Probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

**6.  Calculation**

* P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
