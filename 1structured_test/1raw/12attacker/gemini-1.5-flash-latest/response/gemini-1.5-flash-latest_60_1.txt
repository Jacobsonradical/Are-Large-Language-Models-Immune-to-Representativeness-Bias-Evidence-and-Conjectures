Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender given the evidence from the witness.

**2. Define Events**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**3.  Prior Probabilities**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (15% of the population is male)
* **P(F) = 0.85** (85% of the population is female)

**4. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities)**

* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

**5. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

**6. Calculate P(M|W)**

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)] 
P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the witness's testimony and the population demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
