Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our problem:**

* **Event A:** Attacker is male.
* **Event B:** Witness identifies the attacker as male.

Let's break down the terms:

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being male = 0.15 (given in the problem).
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is male = 0.8 (given in the problem).
* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is female = 0.2 (given in the problem, as they err 20% of the time).
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of the attacker being female = 0.85 (given in the problem).

**Calculating P(B):**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
