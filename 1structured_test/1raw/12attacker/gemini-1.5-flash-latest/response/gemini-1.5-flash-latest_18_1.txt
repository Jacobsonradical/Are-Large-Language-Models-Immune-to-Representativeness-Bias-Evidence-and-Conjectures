Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

**1. Define Events**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**2. Given Information**

* **P(W|M) = 0.8:** Probability of witness correctly identifying a male as male.
* **P(W|F) = 0.2:** Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a female as male.
* **P(M) = 0.15:** Prior probability of a randomly selected person being male.
* **P(F) = 0.85:** Prior probability of a randomly selected person being female.

**3. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness's identification.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

To find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

**4. Calculation**

* P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 (approximately)

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4138}
