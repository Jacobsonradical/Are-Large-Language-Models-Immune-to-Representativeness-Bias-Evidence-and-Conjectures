Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* **M:**  Attacker is male.
* **F:** Attacker is female.
* **W:** Witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (From information "a", 15% of the population is male)
* **P(F) = 0.85** (From information "a", 85% of the population is female)

**3. Conditional Probabilities (from information "b")**

* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (Witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (Witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being male) given new evidence (witness testimony).

```
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]
```

**5. Calculation**

* P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
* P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
* P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
* P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
