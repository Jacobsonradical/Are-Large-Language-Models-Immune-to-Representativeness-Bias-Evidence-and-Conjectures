Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **M:**  The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(M|W): Probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male. This is what we want to find.
* P(W|M): Probability the witness identifies someone as male given they are actually male (80% from the information provided).
* P(M): Prior probability of the attacker being male (15% from the information provided).
* P(W): Probability the witness identifies someone as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

**3. Calculate P(W|F):**

* P(W|F): Probability the witness identifies someone as male given they are actually female (20% from the information provided).

**4. Calculate P(W):**

* P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**5. Calculate P(M|W):**

* P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
