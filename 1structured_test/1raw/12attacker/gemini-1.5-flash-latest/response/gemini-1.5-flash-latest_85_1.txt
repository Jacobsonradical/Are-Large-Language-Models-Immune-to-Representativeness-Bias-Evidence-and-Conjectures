Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to Our Case**

* **A:** Attacker is male.
* **B:** Witness identified the attacker as male.

Let's break down the terms:

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being male = 15% (given in information "a").
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is male = 80% (given in information "b").
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (this needs to be calculated).

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to consider two scenarios:

1. **Attacker is male:**  Probability of the witness being correct = 80% * 15% = 12%
2. **Attacker is female:** Probability of the witness being wrong = 20% * 85% = 17%

Therefore, P(B) = 12% + 17% = 29%

**Putting it All Together**

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
