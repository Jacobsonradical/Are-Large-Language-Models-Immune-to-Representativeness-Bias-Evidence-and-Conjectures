Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in information "a").

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male:** 80% (given in information "b").
* **Likelihood of the witness identifying a female as male:** 20% (given in information "b").

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update the prior probability based on the witness's testimony.  Let:

* **A:**  The event that the attacker is male.
* **B:** The event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of the attacker being male given the witness identified them as male.
* P(B|A): The likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male (80%).
* P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being male (15%).
* P(B): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (we need to calculate this).

**4. Calculating P(B):**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both possibilities:

* **Witness identifies a male as male:**  P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Witness identifies a female as male:** P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**5. Calculating P(A|B):**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
