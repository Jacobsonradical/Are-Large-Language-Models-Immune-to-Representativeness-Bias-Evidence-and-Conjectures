Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **M:** Attacker is male
* **F:** Attacker is female
* **W:** Witness identifies the attacker as male

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

**3. Calculate Components:**

* **P(W|M):** Probability of witness identifying as male given the attacker is male = 80% (from the witness's accuracy)
* **P(M):** Prior probability of the attacker being male = 15% (from population statistics)
* **P(W):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This requires the law of total probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
    * P(W|F) = 20% (witness incorrectly identifies as male when attacker is female)
    * P(F) = 85% (population statistics)
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(M|W):**

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
