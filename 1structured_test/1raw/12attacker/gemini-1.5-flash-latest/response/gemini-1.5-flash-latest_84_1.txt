Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony. 

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened. 
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Applying to Our Case:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is male.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**Let's break down the terms:**

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in "a").
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male is 80% (given in "b").
* **P(B):**  This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of their actual gender. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.4%.**
