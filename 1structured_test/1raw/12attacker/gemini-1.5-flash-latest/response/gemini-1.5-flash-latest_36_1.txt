Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (15% of the population is male)
* **P(F) = 0.85** (85% of the population is female)

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities)**

* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (Probability of witness correctly identifying a male as male)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find **P(M|W)**, the probability the attacker is male given the witness's statement.

```
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W) 
```

Where P(W) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

```
P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
```

**5. Calculation**

* **P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**
* **P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
