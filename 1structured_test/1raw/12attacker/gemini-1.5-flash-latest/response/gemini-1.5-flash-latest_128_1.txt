Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two sources of information:

* **Prior probability:** 15% of the city's population is male.
* **Witness testimony:** The witness claims the attacker was male, but their accuracy is only 80%.

We need to combine these to find the updated probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (what we want to calculate).
* P(B|A): The probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A): The prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B): The probability of event B happening.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define our events:

* A: Attacker is male.
* B: Witness identifies the attacker as male.

Now, let's plug in the values:

* P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability of the attacker being male)
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male)
* P(B|not A) = 0.20 (Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  
* P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker is male increases from 15% to approximately 41%. While the witness's testimony adds information, it's important to note that the probability is still significantly below 50%.
