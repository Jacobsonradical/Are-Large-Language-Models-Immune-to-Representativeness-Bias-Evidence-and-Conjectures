Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is 80% accurate in identifying gender under similar conditions.
* **Population Demographics:** 15% of the city's population is male.

We need to combine these pieces of information to estimate the probability that the attacker was male.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps update our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find)
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A
* P(B) = Prior probability of event B

**Defining our Events**

* **A:** The attacker is male.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**Calculating the Probabilities**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being male (based on population demographics) = 0.15
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given they are male (witness accuracy) = 0.80
* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given they are female (1 - witness accuracy) = 0.20
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of the attacker not being male (female) = 0.85

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be found using the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41 or 41%.**
