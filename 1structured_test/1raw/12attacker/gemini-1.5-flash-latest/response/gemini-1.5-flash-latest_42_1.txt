Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male, using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:**  The event that the witness identified the attacker as male.
* **M:** The event that the attacker is male.
* **F:** The event that the attacker is female.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (The prior probability of the attacker being male, based on the city's population)
* **P(F) = 0.85** (The prior probability of the attacker being female)

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(A|M) = 0.80** (The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given they are actually male)
* **P(A|F) = 0.20** (The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given they are actually female)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(M|A)**, the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|A) = [P(A|M) * P(M)] / P(A)

To find P(A), we use the law of total probability:

P(A) = P(A|M) * P(M) + P(A|F) * P(F)

**5. Calculations:**

* P(A) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(M|A) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
