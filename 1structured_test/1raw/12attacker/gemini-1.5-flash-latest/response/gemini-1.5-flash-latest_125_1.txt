Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two sources of information:

* **Prior Probability:** The overall population distribution of males and females in the city.
* **Witness Testimony:** The witness's reliability in identifying gender under similar conditions.

We need to combine these to determine the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem**

This is a classic scenario for applying Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief based on new evidence:

* **P(A|B):** The probability of the attacker being male (A) given the witness's testimony (B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male (this is the witness's accuracy).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male (15% from the city population).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (this needs to be calculated).

**Calculating P(B)**

To get P(B), we need to consider both scenarios: the witness correctly identifying a male and incorrectly identifying a female as male:

* **Scenario 1:** Witness correctly identifies a male (80% accuracy * 15% male population = 0.12)
* **Scenario 2:** Witness incorrectly identifies a female as male (20% error * 85% female population = 0.17)

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Now we can plug in the values:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
