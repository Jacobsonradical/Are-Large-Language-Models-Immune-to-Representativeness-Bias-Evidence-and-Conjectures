Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **M:** The attacker is male.
*  **F:** The attacker is female.
*  **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. Given Information:**

* **P(W|M) = 0.8:**  Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male (80%).
* **P(W|F) = 0.2:** Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male (20%).
* **P(M) = 0.15:**  Probability of a randomly selected person in the city being male (15%).
* **P(F) = 0.85:** Probability of a randomly selected person in the city being female (85%).

**3. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being male) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

```
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)] 
```

**4. Calculate:**

```
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29 
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.414
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
