Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:  P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(M|W):** The probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male. This is what we want to find.
* **P(W|M):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given they are actually male. This is the witness's accuracy rate for males, which is 80%.
* **P(M):** The prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 15% based on the city's population.
* **P(W):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as male (regardless of actual gender).  We need to calculate this.

**3. Calculate P(W):**

We can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

* **P(W|M):**  0.8 (witness accuracy for males)
* **P(M):** 0.15
* **P(W|F):** 0.2 (witness error rate for females, meaning they incorrectly identify a female as male)
* **P(F):** 0.85

Therefore:
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**4. Calculate P(M|W):**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
