Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in "a").

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given attacker is male:** 80% (witness is correct 80% of the time)
* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given attacker is female:** 20% (witness is incorrect 20% of the time)

**3. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief based on new evidence:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness said Male) = [P(Witness said Male | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male)] / P(Witness said Male)

To find P(Witness said Male), we need to consider both possibilities:

* P(Witness said Male) = [P(Witness said Male | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male)] + [P(Witness said Male | Attacker is Female) * P(Attacker is Female)] 
* P(Witness said Male) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculation**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness said Male) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
