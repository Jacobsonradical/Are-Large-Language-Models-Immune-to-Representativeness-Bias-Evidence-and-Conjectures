Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic case of Bayes' Theorem. We want to update our belief about the attacker's gender (male) given the new evidence from the witness.

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A (attacker is male) given that event B (witness identified as male) has occurred. This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male (80% accuracy).
* P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (15% from the population data).
* P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This requires calculating the probability of a correct identification (male attacker identified as male) and an incorrect identification (female attacker identified as male).

**Calculations**

1. **P(B|A) = 0.8** (given in the problem)
2. **P(A) = 0.15** (given in the problem)
3. **P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]** 
   *  P(B|not A) = 0.2 (20% chance of incorrect identification)
   *  P(not A) = 0.85 (probability of attacker being female)
   *  P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

4. **P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138** (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
