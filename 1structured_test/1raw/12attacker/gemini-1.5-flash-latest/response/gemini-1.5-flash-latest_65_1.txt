Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (from information "a").

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of Witness Saying Male if Attacker is Male:** 80% (from information "b")
* **Likelihood of Witness Saying Male if Attacker is Female:** 20% (from information "b"). This is the error rate.

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on new evidence:

P(Attacker is Male | Witness said Male) = 
[P(Witness said Male | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male)] / 
[P(Witness said Male | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male) + P(Witness said Male | Attacker is Female) * P(Attacker is Female)]

**4. Calculation:**

* P(Attacker is Male | Witness said Male) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
* P(Attacker is Male | Witness said Male) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
* P(Attacker is Male | Witness said Male) â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
