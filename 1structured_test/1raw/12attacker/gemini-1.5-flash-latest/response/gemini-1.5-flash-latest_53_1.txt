Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the percentage of males in the city: 15% or 0.15

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of the witness saying "male" given the attacker is actually male:** 80% or 0.8 (witness is correct)
* **Likelihood of the witness saying "male" given the attacker is actually female:** 20% or 0.2 (witness is incorrect)

**3. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior belief (the attacker is male) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony):

P(Male | Witness said male) = [P(Witness said male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness said male)

To find P(Witness said male), we need to consider both scenarios:

* P(Witness said male) = [P(Witness said male | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness said male | Female) * P(Female)]
* P(Witness said male) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now, we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Male | Witness said male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.4138}
