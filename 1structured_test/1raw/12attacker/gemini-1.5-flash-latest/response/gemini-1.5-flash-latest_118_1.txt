Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony.

**Let's Define Events:**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (From information "a", 15% of the population is male)
* **P(F) = 0.85** (From information "a", 85% of the population is female)

**Likelihoods:**

* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (From information "b", the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (From information "b", the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

**Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W) 
```

Where P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

```
P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
```

**Calculations:**

1. **Calculate P(W):** 
   P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(M|W):**
   P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
