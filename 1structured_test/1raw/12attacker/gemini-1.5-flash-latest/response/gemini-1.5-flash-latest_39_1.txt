Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the percentage of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness identifying male given attacker is male:**  80% or 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
* **Likelihood of witness identifying male given attacker is female:** 20% or 0.2 (the witness is incorrect 20% of the time)

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of attacker being male (A) given the witness identified them as male (B) 
* P(B|A) = Likelihood of witness identifying male given attacker is male (0.8)
* P(A) = Prior probability of attacker being male (0.15)
* P(B) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (we need to calculate this)

**4. Calculate P(B):**

* P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can happen in two ways:
    * The attacker is male, and the witness is correct: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
    * The attacker is female, and the witness is incorrect: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 
* P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**5. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Male | Witness identified male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
