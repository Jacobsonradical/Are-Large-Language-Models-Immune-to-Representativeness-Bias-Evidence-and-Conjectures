Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in information "a").

**2. Likelihood Ratio:**

* The witness correctly identified a male as male 80% of the time.
* The witness incorrectly identified a female as male 20% of the time.
* Likelihood Ratio = (Probability of witness saying male given male) / (Probability of witness saying male given female) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

**3. Posterior Probability (Bayes' Theorem):**

* Posterior Probability = (Prior Probability * Likelihood Ratio) / [(Prior Probability * Likelihood Ratio) + (1 - Prior Probability)]
* Posterior Probability = (0.15 * 4) / [(0.15 * 4) + (0.85)]
* Posterior Probability = 0.6 / 1.4 
* Posterior Probability â‰ˆ 0.43

**Answer:** {probability: 0.43} 

**Explanation:**

The witness's testimony increases the probability of the attacker being male from the initial 15% to approximately 43%. This is because the witness is more likely to identify a male correctly than a female incorrectly. However, it's important to remember that this is still a relatively low probability, and there is a significant chance the attacker could be female.
