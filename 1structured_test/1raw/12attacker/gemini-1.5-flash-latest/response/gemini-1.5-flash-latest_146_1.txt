Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Accuracy:** The witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.
* **Population Distribution:**  The city has a much higher proportion of females (85%) compared to males (15%).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's statement. 

* **Let A be the event "the attacker is male."**
* **Let B be the event "the witness identified the attacker as male."**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male. 

Bayes' Theorem states: 

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as male *given* the attacker is male. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male, which is the proportion of males in the city, 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
