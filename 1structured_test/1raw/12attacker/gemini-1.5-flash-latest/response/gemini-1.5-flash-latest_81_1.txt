Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the percentage of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2.  Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of Witness Saying Male if Attacker is Male:** 80% (the witness's accuracy)
* **Likelihood of Witness Saying Male if Attacker is Female:** 20% (the witness's error rate)

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on the witness's testimony. 

Let:

*  A = Attacker is male
*  B = Witness says the attacker is male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is male given the witness said so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness saying male, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
      = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) 
      = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
       = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Even with the witness's testimony, the probability of the attacker being male increases from 15% to about 41.4%. However, it's important to remember that this is still not a definitive answer and there's still a significant chance (over 58%) that the attacker was female.
