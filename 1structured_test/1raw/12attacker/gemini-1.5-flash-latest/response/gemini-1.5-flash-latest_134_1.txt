Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **M:** Attacker is male
* **F:** Attacker is female
* **W:** Witness identifies the attacker as male

**2. Given Probabilities:**

* **P(F) = 0.85** (85% of the population is female)
* **P(M) = 0.15** (15% of the population is male)
* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (Witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (Witness incorrectly identifies female as male 20% of the time)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

To find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

**4. Calculate:**

* P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.28 
* P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.4286 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4286}
