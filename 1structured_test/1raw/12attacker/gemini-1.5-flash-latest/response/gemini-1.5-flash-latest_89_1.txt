Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Accuracy:** The witness is correct 80% of the time, meaning they have a 20% chance of being wrong about someone's gender.
* **Population Demographics:**  The city is predominantly female (85%).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This scenario is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs about an event based on new evidence. 

Let's define the events:

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find **P(M|W)**, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|M):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as male *given* the attacker is male. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.8.
* **P(M):** The prior probability that the attacker is male, which is the proportion of males in the population, 0.15.
* **P(W):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as male, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.429 (rounded to three decimal places)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.429}
