Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

**1.  Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (from information 'a').

**2.  Likelihood:**

* The witness correctly identified a male as male 80% of the time (from information 'b').

**3.  Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's statement:

```
P(Male | Witness Male) = [P(Witness Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness Male) 
```

Where:

* P(Male | Witness Male) = Probability of the attacker being male given the witness identified them as male.
* P(Witness Male | Male) = Probability of the witness identifying a male as male (80% from information 'b').
* P(Male) = Prior probability of the attacker being male (15% from information 'a').
* P(Witness Male) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(Witness Male) = P(Witness Male | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness Male | Female) * P(Female)
    * P(Witness Male) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**4. Calculation:**

```
P(Male | Witness Male) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(Male | Witness Male) â‰ˆ 0.41 
```

**Answer:** {probability: 0.41} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41 or 41%.**
