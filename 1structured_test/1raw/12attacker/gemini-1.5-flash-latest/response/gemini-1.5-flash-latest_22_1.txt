Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the proportion of males in the city: 15% or 0.15.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is male:** This is the witness's accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given the attacker is female:** This is the witness's error rate, 20% or 0.2.

**3. Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement:

```
P(Male | Witness says "male") = [P(Witness says "male" | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says "male")
```

To calculate the denominator, P(Witness says "male"), we use the law of total probability:

```
P(Witness says "male") = P(Witness says "male" | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness says "male" | Female) * P(Female) 
```

**4. Calculation**

Let's plug in the values:

* P(Witness says "male" | Male) = 0.8
* P(Male) = 0.15
* P(Witness says "male" | Female) = 0.2
* P(Female) = 0.85

```
P(Witness says "male") = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29
```

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

```
P(Male | Witness says "male") = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
