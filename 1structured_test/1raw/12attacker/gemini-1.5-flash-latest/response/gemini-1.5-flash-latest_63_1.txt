Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in information "a").

**2. Likelihood Ratios:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" if attacker is male:** 80% (correct identification rate)
* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" if attacker is female:** 20% (error rate)

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony:

* **P(Male | Witness says male) = [P(Witness says male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says male)**

To calculate the denominator, we need the probability of the witness saying "male" in general:

* **P(Witness says male) = [P(Witness says male | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness says male | Female) * P(Female)]**
* **P(Witness says male) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29**

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement:

* **P(Male | Witness says male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.4%.**
