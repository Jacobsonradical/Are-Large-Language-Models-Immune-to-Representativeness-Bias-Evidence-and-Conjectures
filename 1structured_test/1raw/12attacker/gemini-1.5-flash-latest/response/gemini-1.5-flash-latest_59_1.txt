Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony. 

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of the attacker being male is 15% (from information "a").
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as male, given they are actually male, is 80% (from information "b").
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A (attacker is male) given event B (witness identified as male).
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B (witness identified as male) given event A (attacker is male).
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A (attacker is male).
* P(B) = Probability of event B (witness identified as male), which can be calculated using the law of total probability.

**Calculations**

1. **P(B|A) = 0.8** (given in information "b")
2. **P(A) = 0.15** (given in information "a")
3. **P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]** 
   * P(B|¬A) = Probability of witness identifying as male given attacker is female = 20% (error rate from information "b").
   * P(¬A) = Probability of attacker being female = 85% (from information "a").
   * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

4. **P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414**

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
