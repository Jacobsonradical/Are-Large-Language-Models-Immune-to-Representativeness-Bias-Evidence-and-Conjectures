Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony. 

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of a randomly selected person in the city being male is 15% (given in the information).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male is 80%.
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A happened (the likelihood).
* P(A) is the probability of event A happening (the prior probability).
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening (calculated using the law of total probability).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define our events:

* A: Attacker is male
* B: Witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.

* **P(B|A):**  The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male (likelihood) is 80% (given).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given).
* **P(B):**  The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)  = 0.26 

**Calculation**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4615}
