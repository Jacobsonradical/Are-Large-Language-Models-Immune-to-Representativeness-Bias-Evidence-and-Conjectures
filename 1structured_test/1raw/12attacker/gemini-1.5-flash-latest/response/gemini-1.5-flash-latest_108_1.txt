Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Base Rate:**

* The base rate of males in the city is 15%. This is our prior probability.

**2. Witness's Accuracy:**

* The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. 
* This means there's a 20% chance they are wrong.

**3. Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony:

* **P(Male | Witness Male) = [P(Witness Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness Male)**

Let's break down each part:

* **P(Male | Witness Male):** The probability the attacker is male given the witness said they were male. This is what we want to find.
* **P(Witness Male | Male):** The probability the witness would say the attacker was male given they actually were male (this is 80% from the witness's accuracy).
* **P(Male):** The base rate of males in the city (15%).
* **P(Witness Male):** The probability the witness would say the attacker was male, regardless of their actual gender. This requires considering both scenarios:
    * Witness correctly identifies a male: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * Witness incorrectly identifies a female as male: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
    * P(Witness Male) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculation:**

P(Male | Witness Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.38%.**
