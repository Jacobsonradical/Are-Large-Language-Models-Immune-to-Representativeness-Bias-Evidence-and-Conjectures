Here's how we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **M:** The attacker is male.
*  **F:** The attacker is female.
*  **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. Given Information:**

*  P(W|M) = 0.8 (Probability of witness correctly identifying a male as male)
*  P(W|F) = 0.2 (Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)
*  P(M) = 0.15 (Prior probability of a male in the population)
*  P(F) = 0.85 (Prior probability of a female in the population)

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

We need to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male. Bayes' Theorem provides the framework:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

To calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F) 

**4. Calculation:**

* P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26
* P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
