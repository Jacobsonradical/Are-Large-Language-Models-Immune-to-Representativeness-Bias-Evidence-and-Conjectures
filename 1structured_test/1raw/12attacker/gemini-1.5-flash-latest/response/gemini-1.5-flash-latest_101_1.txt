Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Accuracy:** The witness is correct about gender 80% of the time, meaning they are wrong 20% of the time.
* **Population Demographics:** The city has a significantly higher proportion of females (85%) compared to males (15%).

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the population demographics. Here's a breakdown of the possibilities:

1. **Witness correctly identifies a male attacker:** 
   * Probability of male attacker: 0.15 (15% of the population)
   * Probability of witness correctly identifying: 0.80 
   * Probability of this scenario: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

2. **Witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male:**
   * Probability of female attacker: 0.85 (85% of the population)
   * Probability of witness incorrectly identifying: 0.20
   * Probability of this scenario: 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

**Final Calculation**

To find the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider the probability of each scenario and normalize by the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male:

* Probability of attacker being male (given witness's testimony): (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.414

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414}
