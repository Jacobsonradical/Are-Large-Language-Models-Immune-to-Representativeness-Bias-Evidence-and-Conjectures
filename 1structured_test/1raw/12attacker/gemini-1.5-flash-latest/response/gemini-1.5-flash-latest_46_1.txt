Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being male, using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* We have prior information about the gender distribution in the city (85% female, 15% male).
* We have evidence from a witness, but the witness isn't perfect.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our case**

* Let A be the event "the attacker is male".
* Let B be the event "the witness identifies the attacker as male".

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies a male as male is 80% (given in the problem).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in the problem).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it all together**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness's identification and the population demographics, the probability that the attacker was male is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
