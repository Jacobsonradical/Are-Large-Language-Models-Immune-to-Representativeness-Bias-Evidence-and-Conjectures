Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **M:** The attacker is male.
*  **F:** The attacker is female.
*  **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (in this case, the attacker being male) given new evidence (the witness's testimony).

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(M|W): Probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.  This is what we want to find.
* P(W|M): Probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male (80% from the given information).
* P(M): Prior probability of the attacker being male (15% from the given population information).
* P(W): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male.  This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)

**3. Calculate P(W|F):**

* P(W|F): Probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is actually female (20% from the given information, as the witness is wrong 20% of the time).

**4. Calculate P(W):**

* P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate P(M|W):**

* P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
