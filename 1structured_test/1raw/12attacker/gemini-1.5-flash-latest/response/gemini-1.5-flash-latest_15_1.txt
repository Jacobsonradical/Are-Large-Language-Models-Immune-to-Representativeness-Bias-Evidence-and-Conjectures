Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's gender given the witness testimony. 

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of a person being male in the city is 15% (P(Male) = 0.15).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as male, given they are actually male (P(Witness says Male | Male) = 0.8).
* **Likelihood of Error:** The probability of the witness identifying someone as male, given they are actually female (P(Witness says Male | Female) = 0.2).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(Male | Witness says Male) = [P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says Male)

To find P(Witness says Male), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** The person is male, and the witness correctly identifies them.
* **Scenario 2:** The person is female, and the witness incorrectly identifies them as male.

P(Witness says Male) = [P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness says Male | Female) * P(Female)]

**Calculations**

1. **P(Witness says Male):**
   * (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26 

2. **P(Male | Witness says Male):**
   * (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615 (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4615 or 46.15%.**
