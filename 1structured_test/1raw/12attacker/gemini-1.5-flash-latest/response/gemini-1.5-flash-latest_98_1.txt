Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given by "a").

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male:** 80% (given by "b")
* **Likelihood of the witness identifying a female as male:** 20% (given by "b")

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's gender based on the witness's testimony.  

Let:

* A = Attacker is male
* B = Witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(B|A) = Likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male = 0.8
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being male = 0.15
* P(B) = Overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) 
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
