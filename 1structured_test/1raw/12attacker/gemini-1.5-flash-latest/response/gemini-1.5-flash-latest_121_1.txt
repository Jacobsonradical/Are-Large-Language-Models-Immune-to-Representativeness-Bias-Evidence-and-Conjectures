Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1.  Understanding the Problem:**

We have two sources of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness has a certain accuracy in identifying gender.
* **Population Demographics:** The city has a skewed gender distribution.

We need to combine these to estimate the probability the attacker is male.

**2.  Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. It looks like this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**3.  Defining Our Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is male.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**4.  Calculating the Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (given the city's population demographics).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given they are male is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy).
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given they are female is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).
* **P(not A):** The prior probability of the attacker being female is 0.85.

**5.  Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

To calculate P(A|B) (the probability the attacker is male given the witness's identification), we need P(B).  We can find this using the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the witness's testimony and the city's population demographics, there is approximately a 41.38% probability that the attacker was male.
