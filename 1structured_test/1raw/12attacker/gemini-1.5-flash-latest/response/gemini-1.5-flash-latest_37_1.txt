Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (given in "a"). This represents the base probability before considering the witness testimony.

**2.  Likelihoods:**

* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given attacker is male:** 80% (correct identification rate).
* **Likelihood of witness saying "male" given attacker is female:** 20% (error rate).

**3.  Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update the prior probability based on new evidence:

P(Male | Witness says "male") = [P(Witness says "male" | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says "male")

Where:

* P(Male | Witness says "male") is the probability the attacker is male given the witness said "male".
* P(Witness says "male" | Male) is the likelihood of the witness saying "male" given the attacker is male (80%).
* P(Male) is the prior probability of the attacker being male (15%).
* P(Witness says "male") is the overall probability of the witness saying "male". This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(Witness says "male") = P(Witness says "male" | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness says "male" | Female) * P(Female)
    * P(Witness says "male") = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4.  Calculation:**

P(Male | Witness says "male") = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
