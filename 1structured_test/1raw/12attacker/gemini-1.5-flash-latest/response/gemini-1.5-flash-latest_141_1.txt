Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have a classic example of Bayes' Theorem. We want to find the probability that the attacker is male (event A) given the witness's testimony (event B). 

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony.
* P(B|A): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male.
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being male (based on the city's population).
* P(B): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (this can be calculated using the law of total probability).

**Calculations**

1. **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time.
2. **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% based on the city's population.
3. **P(B):** We need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of their actual gender. We can use the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26 

**Putting it together**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Conclusion**

Based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 46.15%.
