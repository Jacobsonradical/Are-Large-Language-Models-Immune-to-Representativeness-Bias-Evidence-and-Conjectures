To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events M (attacker is male) and W (witness identifies the attacker as male). We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony.

First, we know from the information provided that:

P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(not M) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

We also know that the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time. So, the probability of the witness saying the attacker is male, given that the attacker is male, is:

P(W|M) = 0.8

Similarly, the witness errs 20% of the time, so the probability of the witness saying the attacker is male, given that the attacker is not male, is:

P(W|not M) = 0.2

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|not M) \* P(not M)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4211

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.4211 or 42.11%.

{probability: 0.4211}
