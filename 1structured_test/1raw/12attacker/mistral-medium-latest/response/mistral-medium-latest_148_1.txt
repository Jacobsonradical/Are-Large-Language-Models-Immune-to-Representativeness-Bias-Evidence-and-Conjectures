To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(M|A) = P(A|M) \* P(M) / [P(A|M) \* P(M) + P(A|F) \* P(F)]

Where:
M - attacker is male
F - attacker is female
A - witness identified the attacker as male

P(M) = 0.15 (probability of a random person in the city being male)
P(F) = 0.85 (probability of a random person in the city being female)
P(A|M) = 1.0 (since the witness is always correct when the attacker is male)
P(A|F) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

Now, we can calculate P(M|A):

P(M|A) = (1.0 \* 0.15) / [(1.0 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(M|A) â‰ˆ 0.4167

{probability: 0.4167}
