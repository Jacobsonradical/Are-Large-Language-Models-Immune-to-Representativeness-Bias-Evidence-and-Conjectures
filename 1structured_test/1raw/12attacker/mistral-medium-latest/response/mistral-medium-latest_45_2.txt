To solve this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (from piece of information a).
P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (from piece of information a).
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (from piece of information b).
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2 (from piece of information b).

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the available information is approximately 0.4138.
