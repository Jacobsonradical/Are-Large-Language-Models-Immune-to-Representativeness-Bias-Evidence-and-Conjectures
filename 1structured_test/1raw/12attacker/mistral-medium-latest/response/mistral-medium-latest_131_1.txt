To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male).
P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is female).
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8.
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.389

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.389.
