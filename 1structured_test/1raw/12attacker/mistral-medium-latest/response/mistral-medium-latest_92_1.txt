To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (from information a).
P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (from information a).
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that they are male, which is 0.8 (from information b).
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that they are female, which is 0.2 (from information b).

We want to find the posterior probability P(M|W), which is the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified them as male. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.3889

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3889.
