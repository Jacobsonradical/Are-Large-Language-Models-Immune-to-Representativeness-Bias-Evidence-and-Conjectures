To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both pieces of information: the witness's testimony and the prior probability based on the population's gender distribution.

First, let's denote the probabilities:
P(M) = probability that the attacker is male
P(W|M) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male
P(W|F) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female
P(F) = probability that the attacker is female

We are given:
P(W|M) = 0.8
P(W|F) = 0.2
P(F) = 0.85 (since P(M) = 1 - P(F), then P(M) = 0.15)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.3889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.3889.
