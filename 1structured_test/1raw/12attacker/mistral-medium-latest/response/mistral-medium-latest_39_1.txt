To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population distribution (information b).
- P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (85%) based on the population distribution.
- P(W|M) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (80%) based on the witness's accuracy rate (information a).
- P(W|F) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2 (20%) based on the witness's error rate.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony, P(M|W):

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.395

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony and the population distribution is approximately 0.395.
