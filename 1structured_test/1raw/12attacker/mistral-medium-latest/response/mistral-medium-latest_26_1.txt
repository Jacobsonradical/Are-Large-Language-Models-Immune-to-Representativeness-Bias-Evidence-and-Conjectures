To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (from information a).
- P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (from information a).
- P(W|M) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (from information b).
- P(W|F) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2 (from information b).

We want to find the posterior probability P(M|W), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

By plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the value:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.395

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the provided information is approximately 0.395.
