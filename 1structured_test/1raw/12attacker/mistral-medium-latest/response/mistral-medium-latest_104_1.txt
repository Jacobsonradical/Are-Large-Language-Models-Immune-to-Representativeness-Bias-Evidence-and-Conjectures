To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population data.
P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (85%).
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, which is 0.80 (80%).
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male, which is 0.20 (20%).

We want to find P(M|W), the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.386

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony and the population data, is approximately 0.386.

{probability: 0.386}
