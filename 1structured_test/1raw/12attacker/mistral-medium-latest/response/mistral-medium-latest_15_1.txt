To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker is male, and W represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find the probability P(A|W), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem as follows:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|not A) \* P(not A)]

From the information provided, we can determine the following probabilities:

* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is female)
* P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
* P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4211

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony and the population statistics is approximately 0.4211.

So the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.4211}
