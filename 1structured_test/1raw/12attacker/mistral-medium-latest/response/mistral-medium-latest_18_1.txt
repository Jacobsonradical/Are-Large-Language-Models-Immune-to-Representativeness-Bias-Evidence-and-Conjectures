To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both pieces of information. Let's use Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / [ P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F) ]

where:
M = the attacker is male
F = the attacker is female
W = the witness identifies the attacker as male

Given:
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(W|M) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(W|F) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate the probability:

P(M|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.421 or 42.1%

{probability: 0.421}
