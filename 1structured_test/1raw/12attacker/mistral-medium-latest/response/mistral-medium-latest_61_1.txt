To find the probability that the attacker is male given the two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the reasoning:

1. Let A represent the event that the attacker is male, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.
2. We want to find the probability of A given B, P(A|B).
3. Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
4. From information a, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
5. From information b, we know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.80
6. To find P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is male and the case where the attacker is female. P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as male in both cases.
7. If the attacker is female, the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as male 20% of the time, so P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (¬A represents the event that the attacker is not male).
8. Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female), P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85
9. Plugging the values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / (0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85)
