To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

M: The attacker is male.
W: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find P(M|W). By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / P(W)

From the information given, we know the following probabilities:

P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(~M) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|~M) \* P(~M)

We also need P(W|~M), which is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, this probability is:

P(W|~M) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can find the probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.522

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.522.
