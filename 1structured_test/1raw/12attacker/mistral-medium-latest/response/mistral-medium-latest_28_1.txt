To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(M): The probability that the attacker is male
- P(W|M): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male
- P(W|F): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female

From the problem statement, we have:

1. P(M) = 0.15 (from piece of information a)
2. P(W|M) = 0.8 (from piece of information b)
3. P(W|F) = 0.2 (from piece of information b)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Where P(F) = 1 - P(M) = 0.85

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression above, we find:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4167

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4167.

The answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.4167}
