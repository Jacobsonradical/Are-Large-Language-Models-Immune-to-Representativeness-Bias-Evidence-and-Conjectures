To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is male.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(A), the prior probability of the attacker being male based on the population distribution:

P(A) = 0.15

Next, let's find P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is indeed male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time:

P(B|A) = 0.8

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We can find this by using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A),

where ¬A represents the complementary event of A (the attacker is not male). Since the witness errs in 20% of cases when identifying gender:

P(B|¬A) = 0.2

And P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not male, is:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now we can find P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.27

Finally, we can find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.27 ≈ 0.4444

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4444.
