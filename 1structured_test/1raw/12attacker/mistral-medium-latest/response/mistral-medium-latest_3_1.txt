To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities.

Let's denote:

* P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15% of the population is male according to the information provided).
* P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (85% of the population is female).
* P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time).
* P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases).

We want to find P(M|W), which is the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.386

{probability: 0.386}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.386 or 38.6%.
