To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is male, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

From the problem statement:

- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is female)

We also need P(B|not A), which is the probability that the witness identifies someone as male, given that they are actually female:

P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying gender 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.395

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is approximately 0.395.
