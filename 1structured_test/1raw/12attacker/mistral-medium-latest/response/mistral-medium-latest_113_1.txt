To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events A and B. In this case, event A is "the attacker is male," and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as male."

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

We want to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male (P(A|B)).

We are given:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(B|A) = 1.0 (if the attacker is male, the witness will always identify them as male, since the witness is correct 80% of the time and the attacker's gender is known)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (if the attacker is female, the witness will incorrectly identify them as male 20% of the time)

We need to find P(B) to apply Bayes' theorem:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A)
     = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
     = (1.0 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
     = 0.15 + 0.17
     = 0.32

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
       = (1.0 \* 0.15) / 0.32
       = 0.15 / 0.32
       ≈ 0.46875
