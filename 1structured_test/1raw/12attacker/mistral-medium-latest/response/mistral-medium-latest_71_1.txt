To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities.

Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We want to find the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

We also need to find P(B|not A), which is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, and half of the sample are females:

* P(B|not A) = 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.1

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.1 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.625

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.625.
