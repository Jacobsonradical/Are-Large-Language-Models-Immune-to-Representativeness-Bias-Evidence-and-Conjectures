To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of calculating conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (M) given that the witness identified them as male (W).

First, let's define some probabilities:

- P(M): The probability that a random person in the city is male. This is given as 15% or 0.15.
- P(F): The probability that a random person in the city is female. This is given as 85% or 0.85.
- P(W|M): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
- P(W|F): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male. This is given as 20% or 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) \* P(M)) / (P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.381

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.381.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.381}
