To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of updating probabilities based on new evidence. Here are the steps:

1. Define the probabilities:
Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female. Based on the information given, we know that:
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
Let E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.
2. Find the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis:
The probability that the witness identifies a male as male is 0.8, and the probability that the witness identifies a female as male is 0.2. Therefore, we have:
P(E|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male)
P(E|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
3. Apply Bayes' theorem:
We want to find P(M|E), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Bayes' theorem states that:
P(M|E) = P(E|M) \* P(M) / [P(E|M) \* P(M) + P(E|F) \* P(F)]
Substituting the values, we get:
P(M|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given the evidence is approximately 0.4138.
