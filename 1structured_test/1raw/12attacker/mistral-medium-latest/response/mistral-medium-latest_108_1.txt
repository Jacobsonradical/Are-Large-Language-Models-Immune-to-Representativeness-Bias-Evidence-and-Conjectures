To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (M), given that the witness identified the attacker as male (W).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|not M) \* P(not M)]

We are given the following probabilities:

P(W|M) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a male)
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(not M) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

We also need to find P(W|not M), which is the probability of the witness identifying a female as male. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, this probability is:

P(W|not M) = 0.2 \* (1 / 0.5) = 0.4 (the witness is twice as likely to make a mistake when identifying a female compared to a male)

Now we can plug these probabilities into Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.4 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.252

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.252 or 25.2%.
