To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which deals with conditional probabilities. Here are the steps:

1. Define the probabilities:
   - Let P(M) be the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15% of the population is male).
   - Let P(F) be the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (85% of the population is female).
   - Let P(W|M) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8.
   - Let P(W|F) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2.

2. Calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male:
   - P(W) = P(W and M) + P(W and F) = P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)
   - P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.23

3. Calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony:
   - P(M|W) = P(W and M) / P(W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / P(W)
   - P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.478

Final answer: {probability: 0.478}
