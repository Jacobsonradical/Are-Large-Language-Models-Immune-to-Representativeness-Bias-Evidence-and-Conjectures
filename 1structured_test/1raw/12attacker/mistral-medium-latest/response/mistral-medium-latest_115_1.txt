To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability of a random person being male (15%)
P(F) as the prior probability of a random person being female (85%)
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying a male as male (80%)
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying a female as male (20%)
P(M|W) as the probability we want to find, i.e., the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the given values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.409

{probability: 0.409}
