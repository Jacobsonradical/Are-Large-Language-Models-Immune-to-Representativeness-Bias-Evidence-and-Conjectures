To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b). Here's how:

1. First, let's consider the witness's testimony (information a). The witness is able to correctly identify the gender 80% of the time. So, if we assume that the witness's ability to identify gender is independent of the actual gender distribution in the city, then the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony would be 0.8.
2. Next, let's consider the population distribution in the city (information b). Since 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the prior probability that the attacker is male is 0.15.
3. Now, we need to combine these two pieces of information using Bayes' theorem:

P(male | witness) = [P(witness | male) \* P(male)] / [P(witness | male) \* P(male) + P(witness | female) \* P(female)]

We know that P(witness | male) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time), P(male) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male based on the population distribution), and P(female) = 1 - P(male) = 0.85. However, we don't know P(witness | female), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(witness | female) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time).

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(male | witness) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(male | witness) â‰ˆ 0.385

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution in the city, is approximately 0.385.

{probability: 0.385}
