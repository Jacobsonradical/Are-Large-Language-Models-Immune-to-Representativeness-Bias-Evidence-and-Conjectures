To find the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

By Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

From the information provided:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(B|A) = 1.0 (If the attacker is male, the witness will always identify them as male, since the witness is correct 80% of the time and the attacker is definitely male, which is in the 80% category)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (If the attacker is female, the witness will incorrectly identify them as male 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (1.0 * 0.15) / [(1.0 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.15 / [0.15 + 0.17]
P(A|B) = 0.15 / 0.32
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46875
