To combine these pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Witness says male) = P(Witness says male | Male) \* P(Male) / P(Witness says male)

1. P(Male) = 0.15 (from information a)
2. P(Witness says male | Male) = 0.8 (from information b, the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
3. To find P(Witness says male), we need to consider both the possibility of correctly identifying a male and incorrectly identifying a female as male:
   - P(Witness says male | Male) \* P(Male) + P(Witness says male | Female) \* P(Female)
   - P(Witness says male | Female) = 0.2 (from information b, the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
   - P(Female) = 0.85 (from information a)

Now, calculate P(Witness says male):
P(Witness says male) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(Male | Witness says male):
P(Male | Witness says male) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
