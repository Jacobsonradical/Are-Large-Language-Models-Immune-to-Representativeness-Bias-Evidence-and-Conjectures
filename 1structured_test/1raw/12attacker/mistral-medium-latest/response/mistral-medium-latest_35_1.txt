To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15% of the population is male).
P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (85% of the population is female).
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (the witness is 80% accurate).
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time).

We want to find the posterior probability P(M|W), which is the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.395 or 39.5%

{probability: 0.395}
