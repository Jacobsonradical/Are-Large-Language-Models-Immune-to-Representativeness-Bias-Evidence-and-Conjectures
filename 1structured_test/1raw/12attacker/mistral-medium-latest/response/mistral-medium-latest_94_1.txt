To solve this question, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(M|A) = [P(A|M) \* P(M)] / [P(A|M) \* P(M) + P(A|F) \* P(F)]

Where:
- P(M|A) is the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony.
- P(A|M) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- P(M) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population distribution in the city.
- P(A|F) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female.
- P(F) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (85%) based on the population distribution in the city.

Now, we are given that the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. Thus:
- P(A|M) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(A|F) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

Now, we can calculate P(M|A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(M|A) â‰ˆ 0.3947

Thus, the estimated probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony and the population distribution is approximately 0.3947.
