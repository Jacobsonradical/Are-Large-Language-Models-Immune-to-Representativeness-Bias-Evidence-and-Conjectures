To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities.

Let's denote:

* P(M) as the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)
* P(F) as the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is female)
* P(W|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8
* P(W|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2

We want to find the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, denoted as P(M|W).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.395

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution, is approximately 0.395 or 39.5%.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.395}
