To find the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (from information a)
P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (from information a)
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (from information b)
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2 (from information b)

We want to find the posterior probability P(M|W), which is the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4286

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4286.
