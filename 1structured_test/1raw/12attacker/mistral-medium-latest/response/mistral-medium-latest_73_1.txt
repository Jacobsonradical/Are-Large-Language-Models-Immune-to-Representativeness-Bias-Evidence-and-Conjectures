To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population demographics.
P(F) as the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85 (85%).
P(C|M) as the conditional probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.80 (80%).
P(E|F) as the conditional probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 0.20 (20%).

We want to find the posterior probability P(M|C) that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|C) = [P(C|M) \* P(M)] / [P(C|M) \* P(M) + P(C|F) \* P(F)]

Now, plug in the values:

P(M|C) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

After calculating the values, we get:

P(M|C) â‰ˆ 0.386

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the evidence is approximately 0.386.

{probability: 0.386}
