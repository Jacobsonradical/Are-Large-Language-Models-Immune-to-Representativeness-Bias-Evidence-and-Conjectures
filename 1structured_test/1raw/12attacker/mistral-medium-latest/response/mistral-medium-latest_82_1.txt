To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. We want to find P(M | W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony.

First, let's define some probabilities:

P(M): Prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15%) according to the population.
P(F): Prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (85%).
P(W | M): Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male if they are male, which is 0.80 (80%).
P(W | F): Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male if they are female, which is 0.20 (20%).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:
P(M | W) = [P(W | M) \* P(M)] / [P(W | M) \* P(M) + P(W | F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(M | W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression, we get:
P(M | W) â‰ˆ 0.395

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.395.

{probability: 0.395}
