{probability: 0.976}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying someone as male given that they are indeed male. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
2. Next, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying someone as male given that they are actually female. This is given as 20% or 0.2.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male.
4. The probability of a random person being male in the population is 15% or 0.15.
5. The probability of a random person being female in the population is 85% or 0.85.
6. Using Bayes' theorem, P(male|identified as male) = [P(identified as male|male) \* P(male)] / [P(identified as male|male) \* P(male) + P(identified as male|female) \* P(female)]
7. Substituting the values, P(male|identified as male) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.976.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.976.
