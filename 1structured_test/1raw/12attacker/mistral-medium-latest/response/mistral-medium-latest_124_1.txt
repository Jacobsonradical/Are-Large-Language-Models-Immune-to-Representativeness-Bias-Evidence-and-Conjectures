To find the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (15%) from statement a.
P(F) as the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85 (85%).
P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (80%) from statement b.
P(W|F) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2 (20%).

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, P(M|W). By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4211

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4211.

Final answer: {probability: 0.4211}
