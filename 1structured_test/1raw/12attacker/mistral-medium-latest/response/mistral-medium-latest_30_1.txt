To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula that calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is male, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(A) = 0.15 (from a), which is the prior probability that the attacker is male. We are also given P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness always correctly identifies a male attacker as male), and P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (from b), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male.

We can find P(B) by using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
= 1 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85
= 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.32

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (1 \* 0.15) / 0.32
= 0.15 / 0.32
= 0.46875

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.469 or 46.9%.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.469}
