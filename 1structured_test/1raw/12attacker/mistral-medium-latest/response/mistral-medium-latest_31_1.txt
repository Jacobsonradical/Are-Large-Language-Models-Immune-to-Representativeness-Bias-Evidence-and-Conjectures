To find the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Witness said male) = P(Witness said male | Male) * P(Male) / [P(Witness said male | Male) \* P(Male) + P(Witness said male | Female) \* P(Female)]

Where:
- P(Male) = 0.15 (from information a)
- P(Female) = 0.85 (from information a)
- P(Witness said male | Male) = 0.80 (from information b)
- P(Witness said male | Female) = 0.20 (from information b)

Plugging the values in:

P(Male | Witness said male) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(Male | Witness said male) â‰ˆ 0.4211

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness statement, is approximately 0.4211.
