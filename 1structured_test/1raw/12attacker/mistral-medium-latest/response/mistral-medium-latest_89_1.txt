To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Where:
- P(M|W) is the probability the attacker is male given the witness's testimony.
- P(W|M) is the probability the witness correctly identifies a male as male.
- P(M) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is male.
- P(W|F) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.
- P(F) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is female.

From the information given:
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (witness's accuracy for identifying males)
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W|F) = 0.20 (witness's error rate for identifying males, which is also their accuracy for identifying females)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M|W) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.34

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution, is approximately 0.34.
