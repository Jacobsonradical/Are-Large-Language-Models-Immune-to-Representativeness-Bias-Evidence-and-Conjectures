To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The attacker is male
W: The witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the information provided:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male with 80% accuracy)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(not H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

We also need to find P(W|not H), the probability that the witness identifies a female as male. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, this probability is:

P(W|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male with 20% accuracy)

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.383

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.383.
