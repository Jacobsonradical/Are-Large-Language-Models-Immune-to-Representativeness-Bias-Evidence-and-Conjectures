To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (M) given that the witness identified the attacker as male (W).

Let's denote the probability of being male in the population as P(M) = 0.15 and the probability of being female as P(F) = 0.85. We are also given that the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, the probability of the witness saying "male" given that the person is male is P(W|M) = 0.8, and the probability of the witness saying "male" given that the person is female is P(W|F) = 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.395

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony and the population statistics, is approximately 0.395 or 39.5%.
