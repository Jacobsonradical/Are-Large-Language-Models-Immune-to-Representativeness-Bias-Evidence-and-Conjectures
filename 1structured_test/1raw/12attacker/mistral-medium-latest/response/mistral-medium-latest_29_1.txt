To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is male, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

We are given:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)
2. P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
3. P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is female)
4. P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

First, let's calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
