To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is male, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B).

First, we need to find the prior probability, P(A), which is based on the population demographics. Since 15% of the population is male, P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood, P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. According to the witness's accuracy, P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.395

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony and the population demographics, is approximately 0.395.
