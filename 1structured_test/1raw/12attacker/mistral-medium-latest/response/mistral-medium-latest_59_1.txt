To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability that the attacker is male (based on the population data).
P(W|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male.
P(W|not M) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is not male.

We are asked to find the probability P(M|W), which is the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|not M) \* P(not M)]

From the problem statement, we know that:

P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male 80% of the time)
P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male 20% of the time)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M|W) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / [(0.12) + (0.17)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
