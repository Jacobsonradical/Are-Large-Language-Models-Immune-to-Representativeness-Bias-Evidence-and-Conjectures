To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Where:
- P(M|W) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony
- P(W|M) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male
- P(M) is the prior probability of the attacker being male
- P(W|F) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female
- P(F) is the prior probability of the attacker being female

From the information provided, we can assign the following values:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M|W) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony is approximately 0.4138.
