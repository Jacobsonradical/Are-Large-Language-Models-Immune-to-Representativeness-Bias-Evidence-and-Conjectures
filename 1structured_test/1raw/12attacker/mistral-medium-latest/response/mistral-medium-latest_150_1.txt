To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(M): Probability that the attacker is male
- P(W|M): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male
- P(W|F): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(M) = 0.15 (information a)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (information b)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (information b)

Now, we want to calculate P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Where P(F) is the probability that the attacker is female, which is 1 - P(M) = 0.85.

Substituting the given values into the equation:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.426

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is around 0.426.
