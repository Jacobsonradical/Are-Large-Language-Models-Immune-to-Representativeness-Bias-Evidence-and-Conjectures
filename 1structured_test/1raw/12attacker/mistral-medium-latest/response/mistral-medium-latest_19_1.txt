To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the provided information, we need to consider two probabilities:

1. The prior probability of a random person being male in the city (P(Male)).
2. The conditional probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is indeed male (P(Identified|Male)).

The first probability is given as 15% or 0.15. The second probability is given as 80% or 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female (P(Identified|Female)). This is given as 20% or 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified them as male (P(Male|Identified)).

P(Male|Identified) = [P(Identified|Male) \* P(Male)] / [P(Identified|Male) \* P(Male) + P(Identified|Female) \* P(Female)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(Male|Identified) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the values:

P(Male|Identified) â‰ˆ 0.4267

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4267 or 42.67%.
