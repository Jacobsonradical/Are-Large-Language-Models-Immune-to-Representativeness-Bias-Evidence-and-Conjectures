To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote events:

M: The attacker is male.
W: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find the probability P(M|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / P(W)

First, let's find P(W|M), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, P(W|M) = 0.8.

The prior probability P(M) is the probability that a random person in the city is male, which is 0.15 according to the given information.

Now let's find P(W|M') where M' denotes the event that the attacker is female. Since the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, P(W|M') = 0.2.

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|M') \* P(M')

Given that P(M') is the probability that a random person in the city is female, which is 0.85, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can find the probability P(M|W):

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.522

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.522.
