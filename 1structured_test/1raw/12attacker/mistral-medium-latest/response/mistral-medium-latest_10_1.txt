To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. Define the probabilities:
   - P(M): Probability that the attacker is male
   - P(F): Probability that the attacker is female
   - P(W|M): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male
   - P(W|F): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female

2. Given the information, we know:
   - P(M) = 0.15 (from piece of information 'a')
   - P(F) = 0.85 (from piece of information 'a')
   - P(W|M) = 0.8 (from piece of information 'b')
   - P(W|F) = 0.2 (from piece of information 'b')

3. We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

4. According to Bayes' theorem:
   - P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

5. Plug in the values:
   - P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

6. Calculate the probability:
   - P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.395

{probability: 0.395}
