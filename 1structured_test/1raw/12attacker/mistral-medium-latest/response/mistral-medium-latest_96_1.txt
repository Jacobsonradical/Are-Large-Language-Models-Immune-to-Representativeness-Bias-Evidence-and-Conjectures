To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(M) as the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (from information a)
- P(F) as the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85 (from information a)
- P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (from information b)
- P(W|F) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2 (from information b)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4286

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4286.
