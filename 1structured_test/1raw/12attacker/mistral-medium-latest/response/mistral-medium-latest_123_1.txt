To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, which is 0.80
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male, which is 0.20

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Now, we can plug in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.3873

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.3873.
