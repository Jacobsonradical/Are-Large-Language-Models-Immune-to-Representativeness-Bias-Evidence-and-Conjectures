To find the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Witness says Male) = [P(Witness says Male | Male) \* P(Male)] / [P(Witness says Male | Male) \* P(Male) + P(Witness says Male | Female) \* P(Female)]

P(Male) = 0.15 (from information a)
P(Female) = 0.85
P(Witness says Male | Male) = 0.8 (from information b)
P(Witness says Male | Female) = 0.2 (from information b)

Now, substituting the values:

P(Male | Witness says Male) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculate the expression above:

P(Male | Witness says Male) â‰ˆ 0.4286

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony is approximately 0.4286.
