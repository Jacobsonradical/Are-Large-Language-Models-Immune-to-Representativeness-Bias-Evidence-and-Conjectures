To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. Here, the evidence is the witness's testimony.

First, let's define some probabilities:
P(M) = probability that the attacker is male
P(F) = probability that the attacker is female
P(W|M) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male
P(W|F) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female

From the information given, we know that:
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the known values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we get:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.395

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness testimony and the population statistics, is approximately 0.395.
