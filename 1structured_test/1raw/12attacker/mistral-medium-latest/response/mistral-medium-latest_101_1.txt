To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of calculating conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (M) given that the witness identified them as male (W).

First, let's define our probabilities:

P(M): The prior probability of the attacker being male. Since 15% of the population is male, P(M) = 0.15
P(F): The prior probability of the attacker being female. Since 85% of the population is female, P(F) = 0.85
P(W|M): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male if they are indeed male. This is given as 0.8.
P(W|F): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male if they are female. This is given as 0.2.

We want to find P(M|W), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Now, let's plug in our values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculate the numerator:

0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12

Calculate the denominator:

(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
