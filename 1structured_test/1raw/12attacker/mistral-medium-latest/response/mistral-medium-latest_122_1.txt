To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability of a random person being male, which is 0.15 (from information a).
P(F) as the prior probability of a random person being female, which is 0.85 (from information a).
P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as male, given that they are male, which is 0.8 (from information b).
P(W|F) as the probability that the witness identifies the person as male, given that they are female, which is 0.2 (from information b).

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression above gives:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4211

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4211.
