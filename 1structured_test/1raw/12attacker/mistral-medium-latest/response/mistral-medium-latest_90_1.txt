To solve this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Let's denote:

* P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male prior to the witness's testimony (85% of the population is female, so P(M) = 15% / (15% + 85%) = 0.15 / 1 = 0.15)
* P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female prior to the witness's testimony (P(F) = 0.85 / 1 = 0.85)
* P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male (80% chance, so P(W|M) = 0.8)
* P(W|F) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female (20% chance, so P(W|F) = 0.2)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values we get:

P(M|W) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony is approximately 0.4138.

{probability: 0.4138}
