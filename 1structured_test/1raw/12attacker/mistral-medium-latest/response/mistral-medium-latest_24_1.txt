To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male (based on the population distribution), which is 0.15.
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8.
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Where P(F) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85.

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the values:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4167

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4167.
