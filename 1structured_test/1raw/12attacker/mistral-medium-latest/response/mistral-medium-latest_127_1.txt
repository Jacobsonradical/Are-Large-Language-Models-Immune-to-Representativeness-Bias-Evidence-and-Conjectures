To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let M represent the event that the attacker is male, and W represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We want to find P(M|W).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

From the information provided, we know that:

P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(not M) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(W|M) = 1.0 (if the attacker is male, the witness will identify them as male 100% of the time, as the witness's error rate is for identifying females as males, not males as males)
P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M|W) = (1.0 * 0.15) / [(1.0 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4091

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony is approximately 0.4091.
