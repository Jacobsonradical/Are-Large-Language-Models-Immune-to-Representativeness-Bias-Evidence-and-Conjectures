To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(M), and the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male as P(I|M) or P(I|F) depending on whether the attacker is male or female.

From the information given, we know that:

P(M) = 0.15 (from a)
P(F) = 0.85 (from a)
P(I|M) = 0.8 (from b)
P(I|F) = 0.2 (from b)

We want to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male, denoted as P(M|I). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|I) = [P(I|M) \* P(M)] / [P(I|M) \* P(M) + P(I|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|I) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we get:

P(M|I) â‰ˆ 0.42

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.42.
