To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(M) as the probability that the attacker is male based on the population data (0.15).
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is female based on the population data (0.85).
- P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male (0.8).
- P(W|F) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female (0.2).

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the given values:

P(M|W) = [(0.8) \* (0.15)] / [(0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4286

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony is approximately 0.4286.
