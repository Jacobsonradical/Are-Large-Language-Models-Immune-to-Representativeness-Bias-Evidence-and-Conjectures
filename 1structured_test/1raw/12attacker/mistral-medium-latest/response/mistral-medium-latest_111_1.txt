To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population.
P(F) as the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85 (85%).
P(C|M) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (80%).
P(C|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2 (20%).

We want to find P(M|C), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|C) = [P(C|M) \* P(M)] / [P(C|M) \* P(M) + P(C|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M|C) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(M|C) â‰ˆ 0.3829

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3829.
