To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find the conditional probability P(A|B).

First, let's calculate the prior probability P(A) and P(¬A):

P(A) = 0.15 (15% males in the population)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% females in the population)

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of observing the evidence given the attacker's gender:

P(B|A) = 1.0 (since the witness has a 100% chance of correctly identifying a male as male if the attacker is indeed male)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying females as males)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (1.0 \* 0.15) / [(1.0 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

{probability: 0.39285714285714285, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.39 or 39%.
