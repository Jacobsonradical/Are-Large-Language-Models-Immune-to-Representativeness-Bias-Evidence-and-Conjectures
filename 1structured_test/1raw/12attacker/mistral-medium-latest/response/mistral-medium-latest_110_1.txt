To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let M represent the event that the attacker is male, and W represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We want to find P(M|W).

Bayes' theorem states that P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / P(W).

From the given information, P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male), and P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time).

We also need to find P(W|not M) and P(not M). Since P(not M) = 1 - P(M) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female), and the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, P(W|not M) = 0.2.

Now we can find P(W):
P(W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|not M) \* P(not M) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.24.

Finally, we can calculate P(M|W):
P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.24 â‰ˆ 0.4583.
