To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability of a random person being male (15% or 0.15)
P(F) as the prior probability of a random person being female (85% or 0.85)
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male (80% or 0.8)
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female (20% or 0.2)

We want to find the probability P(M|W) of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the given values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.426 or 42.6%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.426.
