To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to find the posterior probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being male) given some observed evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M) and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F). From the information given, we know that:

P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Now let's consider the evidence from the witness. Let's denote the event "the witness identifies the attacker as male" as W. We want to find the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony, which is P(M|W).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

We are given that P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time) and P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating this expression, we find:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.42

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.42.
