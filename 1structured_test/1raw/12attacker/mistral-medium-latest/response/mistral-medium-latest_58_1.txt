To solve this question, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the events as follows:
A: The attacker is male.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is indeed male. According to the information provided, the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A). This is the prior probability that the attacker is male. Given that 15% of the population in the city is male, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we need to find P(B). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender. We can find this probability using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Here, ¬A represents the event that the attacker is not male (i.e., the attacker is female). Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, the probability that the witness identifies a female as male is P(B|¬A) = 0.2. Also, P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, since 85% of the population is female.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.478

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony and the population statistics, is approximately 0.478.
