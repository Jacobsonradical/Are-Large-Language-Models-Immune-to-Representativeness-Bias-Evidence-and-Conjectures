To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to calculate conditional probabilities. Here are the steps:

1. Define the probabilities:
	* P(Male) = 0.15 (probability that a random person in the city is male, based on information a)
	* P(Not Male) = 1 - P(Male) = 0.85 (probability that a random person in the city is not male)
	* P(Identified as Male | Male) = 0.8 (probability that the witness identifies a male as male, based on information b)
	* P(Identified as Male | Not Male) = 0.2 (probability that the witness identifies a female as male, based on information b)
2. Calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified them as male: P(Male | Identified as Male)
3. Use Bayes' theorem: P(Male | Identified as Male) = [P(Identified as Male | Male) \* P(Male)] / [P(Identified as Male | Male) \* P(Male) + P(Identified as Male | Not Male) \* P(Not Male)]
4. Plug in the values: P(Male | Identified as Male) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
