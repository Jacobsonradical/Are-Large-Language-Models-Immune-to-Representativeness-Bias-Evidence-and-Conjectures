To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15% of the population is male).
P(F) as the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (85% of the population is female).
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8.
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2.
P(M|W) as the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male, which is what we want to find.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the given values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression above, we find that:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.3889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.3889 or 38.89%.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.3889}
