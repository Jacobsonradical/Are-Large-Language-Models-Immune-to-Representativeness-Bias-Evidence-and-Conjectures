To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is male, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the given information:

- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Now, we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.4211
