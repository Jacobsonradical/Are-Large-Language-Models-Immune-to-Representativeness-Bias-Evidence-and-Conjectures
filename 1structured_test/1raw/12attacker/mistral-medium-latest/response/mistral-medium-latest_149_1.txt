To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of updating probabilities based on new evidence. Here are the steps:

1. Define the probability of the attacker being male before any evidence is considered. Since we know that 15% of the population is male, we can use this as our prior probability: P(Male) = 0.15.
2. Define the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male. Since the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time, we can use this as our likelihood: P(Identified as male | Male) = 0.8.
3. Define the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually female. Since the witness erred 20% of the time, we can use this as our likelihood: P(Identified as male | Female) = 0.2.
4. Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male: P(Male | Identified as male) = [P(Identified as male | Male) \* P(Male)] / [P(Identified as male | Male) \* P(Male) + P(Identified as male | Female) \* P(Female)].
5. Plug in the values from steps 1-3 into Bayes' theorem: P(Male | Identified as male) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)].
6. Simplify the expression: P(Male | Identified as male) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17].
7. Calculate the final probability: P(Male | Identified as male) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony and the population statistics, is approximately 0.4138.
