To find the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the reasoning:

1. First, let's define some probabilities:
   - P(M): Probability that the attacker is male = 0.15 (from information a)
   - P(F): Probability that the attacker is female = 0.85 (from information a)
   - P(W|M): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male = 0.8 (from information b)
   - P(W|F): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female = 0.2 (from information b)

2. We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
   - P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

3. Plugging in the values, we get:
   - P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

4. Simplifying, we get:
   - P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4286

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4286.

The answer in the requested format: {probability: 0.4286}
