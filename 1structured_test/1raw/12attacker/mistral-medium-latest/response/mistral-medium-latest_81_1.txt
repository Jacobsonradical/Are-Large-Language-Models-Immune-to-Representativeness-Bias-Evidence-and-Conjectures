To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. First, let's denote the probability of being male (M) in the general population as P(M) = 0.15 and the probability of being female (F) as P(F) = 0.85 according to information "a".

2. Let's denote the event that the witness identifies someone as male as W.

3. We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

4. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

   P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

5. From information "b", we know that the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time, so P(W|M) = 0.8. The witness also incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, so P(W|F) = 0.2.

6. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

   P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

7. Calculating this expression, we get:

   P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4211 or 42.11%

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4211.
