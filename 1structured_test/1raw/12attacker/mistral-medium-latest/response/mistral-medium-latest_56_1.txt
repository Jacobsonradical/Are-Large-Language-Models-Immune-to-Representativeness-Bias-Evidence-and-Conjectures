To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both pieces of information.

First, let's denote:
P(M) as the prior probability of a random person being male in the city, which is 0.15 (15%).
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying a male as male, which is 0.80 (80%).
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying a female as male, which is 0.20 (20%).

We want to find the posterior probability P(M|W), which is the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Where P(F) is the prior probability of a random person being female, which is 0.85 (85%).

Now we can plug in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(M|W) ≈ 0.3889 / (0.3889 + 0.17)
P(M|W) ≈ 0.3889 / 0.5589
P(M|W) ≈ 0.6957

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.6957.
