To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15%).
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male, which is 0.8 (80%).
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male, which is 0.2 (20%).

We want to find P(M|W), the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Where P(F) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (85%).

Now we can calculate P(M|W):

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.3636

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.3636.
