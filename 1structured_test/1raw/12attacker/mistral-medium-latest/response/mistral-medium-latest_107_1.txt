To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote:

1. P(M) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (from information a).
2. P(F) is the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85.
3. P(W|M) is the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (from information b).
4. P(W|F) is the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2 (from information b).

Now, we want to find the posterior probability P(M|W), which is the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4091

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4091.
