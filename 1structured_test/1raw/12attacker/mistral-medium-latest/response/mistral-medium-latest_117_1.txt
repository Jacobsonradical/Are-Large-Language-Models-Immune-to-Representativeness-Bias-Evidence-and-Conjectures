To answer this question, we need to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness testimony. We can use Bayes' theorem to do this.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is male, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem statement, we know:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)

Now we need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the witness identifies a male attacker as male (which we already know is 0.8) and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is female, this probability is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, P(B) = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.97
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.124

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony is approximately 0.124.
