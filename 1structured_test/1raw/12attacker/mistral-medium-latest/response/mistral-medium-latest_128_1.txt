To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(M): Probability the attacker is male
- P(W|M): Probability the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male
- P(F): Probability the attacker is female
- P(W|F): Probability the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female

From the problem, we know that:

- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Now, we can calculate P(M|W):

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.395

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.395.
