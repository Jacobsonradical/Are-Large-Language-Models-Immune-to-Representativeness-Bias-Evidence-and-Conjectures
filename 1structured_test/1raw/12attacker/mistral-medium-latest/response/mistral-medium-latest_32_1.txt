To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability of a random person from the city being male (0.15 or 15%)
P(F) as the prior probability of a random person from the city being female (0.85 or 85%)
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying a male as male (0.8 or 80%)
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying a female as male (0.2 or 20%)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the given values in the formula:

P(M|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4286 or 42.86%

However, since we want the probability in a format between 0 and 1, we'll divide by 100:

{probability: 0.4286}
