To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (M) given that the witness identified the attacker as male (W). We can express this as P(M|W).

Bayes' theorem states that P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / P(W)

We are given the following information:

1. P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
2. P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
3. P(~M) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
4. P(W|~M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

First, we need to find P(W). Using the law of total probability, we can express P(W) as:

P(W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|~M) \* P(~M)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(M|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) \* P(M)) / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
