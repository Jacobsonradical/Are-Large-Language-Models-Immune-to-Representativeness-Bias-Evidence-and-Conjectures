To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M) and the witness identifying the attacker as male as I.

We want to find P(M|I), which can be calculated as follows:

P(M|I) = P(I|M) \* P(M) / [P(I|M) \* P(M) + P(I|not M) \* P(not M)]

From the information provided, we have:

P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(not M) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(I|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(I|not M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(M|I) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12
Denominator: (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

P(M|I) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony is approximately 0.4138.
