To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is that 15% of the population is male.

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male
- F as the event that the attacker is female
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We have the following probabilities:
- P(M) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness identifies a male as male)
- P(W|F) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

We want to find the posterior probability P(M|W) - the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the given values:

P(M|W) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.3023

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 30.23%.
