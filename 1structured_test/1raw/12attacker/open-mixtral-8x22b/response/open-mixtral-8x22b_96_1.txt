To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is "the attacker is male" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as male."

First, we calculate the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is given as 15% or 0.15.

Next, we calculate the likelihood that the witness identifies a person as male given that the person is indeed male. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

The probability that the witness makes an error and identifies a person as male given that the person is actually female is 20% or 0.2.

We also need to consider the base rate of females in the population, which is 85% or 0.85.

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)

Here, P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85, and P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, which is 0.2.

So P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.3

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.3 = 0.4

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.4 or 40%.
