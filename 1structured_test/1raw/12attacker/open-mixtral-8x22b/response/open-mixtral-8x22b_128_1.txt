To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event is based on the prior knowledge we have about the event and the new evidence we obtained.

In this case, the prior knowledge is the population distribution, which states that 15% of the population is male. This is our prior probability (P(Male)).

The new evidence is the witness testimony. The witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time and was wrong 20% of the time. If the attacker is male, the probability of the witness identifying them as male is 80%, which is the true positive rate (P(Witness says Male | Male)). If the attacker is female, the witness would still identify them as male 20% of the time, which is the false positive rate (P(Witness says Male | Female)).

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability (P(Male | Witness says Male)):

P(Male | Witness says Male) = P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male) / P(Witness says Male)

P(Witness says Male) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is male, regardless of their actual gender. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(Witness says Male) = P(Male) * P(Witness says Male | Male) + P(Female) * P(Witness says Male | Female)

Substituting the values we have:

P(Witness says Male) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2

P(Witness says Male) = 0.12 + 0.17

P(Witness says Male) = 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(Male | Witness says Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29

P(Male | Witness says Male) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(Male | Witness says Male) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

Here is the final answer in the requested format:
