To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case is:

P(Attacker is male | Witness identifies male) = [P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male)] / P(Witness identifies male)

From the information given:

1. P(Attacker is male) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
2. P(Attacker is female) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
3. P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is male) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
4. P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is female) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Now we need to find P(Witness identifies male), which is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as a male, regardless of their actual gender. This can be calculated as:

P(Witness identifies male) = P(Attacker is male) * P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is male) + P(Attacker is female) * P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is female)

P(Witness identifies male) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.3

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as such:

P(Attacker is male | Witness identifies male) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.3 = 0.4

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.4, or 40%.

Here's the dictionary format:
