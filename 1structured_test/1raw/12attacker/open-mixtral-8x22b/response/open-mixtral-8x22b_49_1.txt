To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Let's denote:

- M as the event that the attacker is male
- F as the event that the attacker is female
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Now, we want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Now, let's calculate this value:

P(M|W) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
