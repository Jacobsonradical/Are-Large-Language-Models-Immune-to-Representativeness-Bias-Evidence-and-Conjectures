To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used to calculate the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Let's define the following events:

A = The attacker is male.
B = The witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Where ~A is the complement of A, i.e., the attacker is female. We know that P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female), and we're given that P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time).

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.413793103

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.413793103.

Here is the dictionary format you requested:
