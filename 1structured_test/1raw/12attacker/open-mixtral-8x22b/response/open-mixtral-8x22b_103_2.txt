To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (M) given that a witness identified the attacker as male (W).

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(M) = 0.15 (The probability that a random person is male)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (The probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that they are actually male)

To find P(W), we need to consider the probabilities of both the witness identifying a person as male given that they are male and the witness identifying a person as male given that they are female. We are given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying a person as male given that they are female is 20%.

P(F) = 0.85 (The probability that a random person is female)
P(W|F) = 0.2 (The probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that they are actually female)

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

Calculating P(W):

P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(W) = 0.29

Now we can find P(M|W):

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)
P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29

Calculating P(M|W):

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
