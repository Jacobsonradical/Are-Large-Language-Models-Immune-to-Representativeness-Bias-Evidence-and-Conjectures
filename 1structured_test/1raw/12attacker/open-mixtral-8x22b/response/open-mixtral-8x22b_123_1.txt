To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both pieces of information given: the witness's ability to correctly identify gender and the population distribution of males and females in the city.

Let's start by calculating the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male (True Positive) and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as a male (False Positive).

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and the population consists of 85% females and 15% males, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

True Positive (TP): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male is 80% of 15% (the proportion of males in the population).
TP = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

False Positive (FP): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as a male is 20% of 85% (the proportion of females in the population).
FP = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. This can be done using Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Witness Identified as Male) = [P(Witness Identified as Male | Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Witness Identified as Male | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness Identified as Male | Female) * P(Female)]

Where:
P(Witness Identified as Male | Male) = TP (True Positive rate) = 0.12
P(Male) = 0.15 (Proportion of males in the population)
P(Witness Identified as Male | Female) = FP (False Positive rate) = 0.17
P(Female) = 0.85 (Proportion of females in the population)

Now, plugging in the values:

P(Male | Witness Identified as Male) = (0.12 * 0.15) / (0.12 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)
P(Male | Witness Identified as Male) = 0.018 / (0.018 + 0.1445)
P(Male | Witness Identified as Male) = 0.018 / 0.1625
P(Male | Witness Identified as Male) â‰ˆ 0.1108

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.1108.
