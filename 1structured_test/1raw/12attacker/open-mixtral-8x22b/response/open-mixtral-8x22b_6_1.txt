To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- M as the event "the attacker is male"
- W as the event "the witness identified the attacker as male"

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

We are given the following information:

- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is male)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is male and female:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)

We know P(not M) = 0.85 (85% of the city's population is female). The witness incorrectly identifies a female as a male 20% of the time, so:

P(W|not M) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.32

Finally, we can find P(M|W):

P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.375.

Here's the answer in the requested dictionary format:
