To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is male.
- E: The witness identified the attacker as male.
- P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being male. According to the information, 15% of the city's population is male, so P(H) = 0.15.
- P(E|H): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male. According to the information, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.
- P(E|~H): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is not male (i.e., female). According to the information, the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, so P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

First, we calculate P(~H), which is the probability that the attacker is not male (i.e., female). Since 85% of the city's population is female, P(~H) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(H|E) = [0.12] / [(0.12) + (0.17)]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the base rates of males and females in the city, is approximately 0.4138.
