To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that provides a way to update our understanding of probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- M as the event that the attacker is male
- F as the event that the attacker is female
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We know that:
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time for males)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time for females)
- P(M) = 0.15 (the probability of a random person being male in the city)
- P(F) = 0.85 (the probability of a random person being female in the city)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. We can calculate this using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Now, let's plug in the values:

P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.318

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.318, or 31.8%.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
