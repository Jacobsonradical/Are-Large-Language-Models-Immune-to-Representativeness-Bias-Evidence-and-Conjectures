To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimates as we gather new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

Let's denote:
- H as the hypothesis that the attacker is male
- E as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male
- P(H) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the city's population
- P(E|H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 80% or 0.80 based on the witness's accuracy in identifying gender
- P(E|~H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male, which is 20% or 0.20 based on the witness's error rate in identifying gender

We want to find P(H|E), the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Since the population is 85% female, P(~H) is 0.85.

Now we can substitute the given values into the formula:

P(H|E) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)]

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.

Here's the estimated probability in the required format:
