To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes the process of updating probabilities based on new evidence.

There are two hypotheses: H1, the attacker is male, and H2, the attacker is female. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The witness correctly identifies a person's gender 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time. This can be represented as P(E|H1) = 0.8 and P(E|H2) = 0.2, where E is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

2. The population of the city consists of 85% females and 15% males. This can be represented as P(H1) = 0.15 and P(H2) = 0.85.

Now, we need to find P(H1|E), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) * P(H1) / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H2) * P(H2)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H1|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.46

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.46.
