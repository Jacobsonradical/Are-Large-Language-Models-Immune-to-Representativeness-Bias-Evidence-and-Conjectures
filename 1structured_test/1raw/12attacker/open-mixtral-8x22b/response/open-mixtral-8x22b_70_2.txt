To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male
- P(M) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (or 15%) according to the population distribution in the city
- P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identified the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (or 80%) according to the witness's ability to judge a person's gender
- P(W|~M) as the probability that the witness identified the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male (i.e., female), which is 0.2 (or 20%) according to the witness's ability to judge a person's gender
- P(~M) as the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (or 85%) according to the population distribution in the city

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)]

Now, let's plug in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.4138 (or 41.38%).

Here's the dictionary format:
{
  "probability": 0.4138,
  "explanation": "Using Bayes' theorem, we calculated the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male to be approximately 41.38%."
