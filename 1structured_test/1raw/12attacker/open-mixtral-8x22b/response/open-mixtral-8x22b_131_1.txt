To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. The two pieces of information we have are the prior probability (the gender distribution in the city) and the likelihood (the witness's ability to correctly identify gender).

The prior probability (P(M)) that the attacker is male is 15%, or 0.15. The prior probability (P(F)) that the attacker is female is 85%, or 0.85.

The witness's accuracy can be broken down into two parts:
1. The true positive rate (TPR), which is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male (P(W|M)). According to the information provided, this is 80%, or 0.8.
2. The false positive rate (FPR), which is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male (P(W|F)). This is the remaining 20% of the time, or 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as such (P(M|W)):

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.41, or 41%.

Here's the dictionary format:
