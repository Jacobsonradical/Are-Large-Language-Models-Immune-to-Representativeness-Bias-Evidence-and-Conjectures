To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the information, let's denote the following:

- Event A: The attacker is male.
- Event B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

We know that:
1. P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is male, is 0.15 (15%).
2. P(~A), the prior probability that the attacker is female, is 0.85 (85%).
3. P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, is 0.8 (80%).
4. P(B|~A), the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, is 0.2 (20%).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.252604166667

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.253, or 25.3%.

Answer in the given format:
{probability: 0.253}
