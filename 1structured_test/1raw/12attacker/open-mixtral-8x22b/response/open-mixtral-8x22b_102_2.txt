To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- M as the event "the attacker is male"
- W as the event "the witness identified the attacker as male"

According to the information given:

- P(M), the prior probability that the attacker is male, is 0.15 (15%).
- P(W|M), the probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that the person is actually male, is 0.8 (80%).
- P(W|~M), the probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that the person is actually female, is 0.2 (20%).

Now, we need to calculate P(~M), the prior probability that the attacker is female:

- P(~M) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

According to Bayes' theorem:

- P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)]

Now, let's calculate P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male:

- P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives approximately 0.405.

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is around 40.5%.
