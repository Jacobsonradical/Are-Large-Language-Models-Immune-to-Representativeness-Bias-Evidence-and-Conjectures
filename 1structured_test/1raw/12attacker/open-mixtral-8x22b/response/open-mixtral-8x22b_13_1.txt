To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is male.
- ~A is the event that the attacker is female.
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is male).
- P(~A) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is female).
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies a male as male).
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).

Now we can plug these values into the formula:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) = [0.12] / [(0.12) + (0.17)]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
