To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(M) as the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 based on the population statistics.
- P(F) as the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85 based on the population statistics.
- P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, which is 0.80 based on the witness's accuracy.
- P(W|F) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, which is 0.20 based on the witness's error rate.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

P(M|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, given the information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
