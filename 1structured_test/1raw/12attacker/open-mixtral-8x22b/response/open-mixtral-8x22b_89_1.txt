To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, our prior probability is the overall population distribution, which states that 15% of the population is male.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and E be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We want to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male, or P(M|E). By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|E) = P(E|M) * P(M) / P(E)

P(M) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is given as 0.15.

P(E|M) is the probability that the witness identifies a male attacker as male, which is given as 0.80.

P(E) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as male, and it can be calculated as follows:

P(E) = P(E|M) * P(M) + P(E|not M) * P(not M)

Since the witness identifies someone as male 80% of the time when they are male, they must identify someone as male 20% of the time when they are not male (i.e., they are female). Given that 85% of the population is female, we have:

P(E) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(M|E):

P(M|E) = P(E|M) * P(M) / P(E) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male is approximately 0.41.
