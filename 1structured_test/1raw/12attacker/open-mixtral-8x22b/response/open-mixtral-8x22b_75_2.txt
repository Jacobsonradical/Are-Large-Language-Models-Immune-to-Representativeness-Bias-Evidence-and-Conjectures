To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, which is the probability we want to find (i.e., the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male).
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A, which is the probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that they are male.
- P(A) is the prior probability of A, which is the probability that a random person in the city is male.
- P(B) is the total probability of B, which is the overall probability that the witness identifies a person as male.

We are given the following information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(B|~A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

First, we need to find P(B), which is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Where P(~A) is the probability that a random person is female, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

Here's the answer in the required format:
