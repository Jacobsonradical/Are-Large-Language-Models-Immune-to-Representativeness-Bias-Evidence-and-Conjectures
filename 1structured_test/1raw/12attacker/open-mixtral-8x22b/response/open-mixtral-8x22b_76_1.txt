To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the prior belief is the proportion of males in the population (15% or 0.15), and the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

The witness's ability to correctly identify gender is given as 80%, which is the true positive rate (TPR). The false positive rate (FPR) can be calculated as 20% (100% - 80%).

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Witness Identification) = (P(Witness Identification | Male) * P(Male)) / P(Witness Identification)

P(Witness Identification | Male) = TPR = 0.8
P(Male) = Prior belief = 0.15

P(Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness Identification | Female) * P(Female)

Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, they incorrectly identify gender 20% of the time. Therefore, P(Witness Identification | Female) is the FPR, which is 0.2.

P(Female) = 1 - P(Male) = 0.85

Now, calculate P(Witness Identification):

P(Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(Male | Witness Identification):

P(Male | Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

Now, let's provide the answer in the requested format:
