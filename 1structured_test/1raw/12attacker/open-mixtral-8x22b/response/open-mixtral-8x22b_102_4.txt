To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- M as the event that the attacker is male
- F as the event that the attacker is female
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

According to the information given:

P(M) = 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being male in the population)
P(F) = 0.85 (the probability of the attacker being female in the population)
P(W|M) = 0.80 (the probability of the witness identifying a male as male)
P(W|F) = 0.20 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

Now, we want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M)P(M) / [P(W|M)P(M) + P(W|F)P(F)]

Substitute the given values:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

Calculate the values:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.3478

So, given the available information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.3478.
