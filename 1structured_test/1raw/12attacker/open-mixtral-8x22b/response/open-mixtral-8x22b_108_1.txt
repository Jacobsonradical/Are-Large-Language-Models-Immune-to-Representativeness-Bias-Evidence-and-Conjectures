To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- H: the event that the attacker is male
- E: the event that the witness identified the attacker as male
- P(H): the prior probability that a random person is male (0.15 according to the given city population data)
- P(E|H): the probability that the witness identifies a male as male (0.80, as mentioned in the witness's accuracy)
- P(E|~H): the probability that the witness identifies a female as male (0.20, as the witness made mistakes 20% of the time)
- P(~H): the prior probability that a random person is female (0.85)

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / (P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H))

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = 0.80 * 0.15 / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.321

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.321.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.321}
