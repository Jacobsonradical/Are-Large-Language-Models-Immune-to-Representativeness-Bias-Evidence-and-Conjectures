To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem calculates the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being male) based on prior knowledge (in this case, the city demographics and the witness's accuracy).

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male.
- F as the event that the attacker is female.
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the given information, we know the following probabilities:
1. P(M) = 0.15 (The probability that the attacker is male, as per the city population statistics)
2. P(F) = 0.85 (The probability that the attacker is female)
3. P(W|M) = 0.8 (The probability that the witness identifies a male as male)
4. P(W|F) = 0.2 (The probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(M|W) as follows:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the given probabilities:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.5128

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.5128.
