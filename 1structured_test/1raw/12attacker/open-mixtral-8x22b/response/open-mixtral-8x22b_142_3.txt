Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

First, let's denote:
- P(M) = prior probability that a random person is male = 0.15
- P(F) = prior probability that a random person is female = 0.85
- P(W|M) = probability of witness identifying a person as male given that the person is male = 0.80
- P(W|F) = probability of witness identifying a person as male given that the person is female = 0.20

We want to find the posterior probability P(M|W), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the numbers we have:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)] = 0.4706

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4706.
