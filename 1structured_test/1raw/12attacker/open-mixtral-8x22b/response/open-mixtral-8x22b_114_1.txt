To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use the information given about the population demographics and the witness's ability to identify gender correctly.

First, we know that 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male. This means that if we had no other information, the probability of the attacker being male would be 0.15 (15%).

However, we also have information from a witness who identified the attacker as male. The witness is able to correctly identify a person's gender 80% of the time and makes errors 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is male | Witness says male) = P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) / P(Witness says male)

We are given:
- P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) = 0.80
- P(Attacker is male) = 0.15

To find P(Witness says male), we can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness says male) = P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness says male | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female)

We know:
- P(Witness says male | Attacker is female) = 0.20 (since the witness makes errors 20% of the time)
- P(Attacker is female) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(Witness says male):

P(Witness says male) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement:

P(Attacker is male | Witness says male) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement is approximately 0.4138.
