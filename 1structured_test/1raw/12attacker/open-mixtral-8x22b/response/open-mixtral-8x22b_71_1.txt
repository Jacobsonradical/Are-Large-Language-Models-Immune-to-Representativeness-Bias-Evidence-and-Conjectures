To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- M as the event that the attacker is male
- F as the event that the attacker is female
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

Bayes' theorem states that P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W).

From the given information, we know:

- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We also know that P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, regardless of their actual gender.

So, let's calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(W) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(M|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)
P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.413793 (rounded to 5 decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.413793.
