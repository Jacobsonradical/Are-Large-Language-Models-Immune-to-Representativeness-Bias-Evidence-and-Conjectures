To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is useful for updating probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male.
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- P(M) as the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 based on the city's population.
- P(W|M) as the probability that the witness would identify a male as male, which is 0.80 based on the witness's accuracy.
- P(W|~M) as the probability that the witness would identify a female as male, which is 0.20 based on the witness's error rate.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)]

Substituting the given values:

P(M|W) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.43

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.43.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
