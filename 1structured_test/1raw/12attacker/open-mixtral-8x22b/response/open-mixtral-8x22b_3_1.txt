To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- M: The attacker is male.
- F: The attacker is female.
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.20 (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Now, we can plug in the given values:

P(M|W) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

P(M|W) = 0.12 / [(0.12) + (0.17)]

P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
