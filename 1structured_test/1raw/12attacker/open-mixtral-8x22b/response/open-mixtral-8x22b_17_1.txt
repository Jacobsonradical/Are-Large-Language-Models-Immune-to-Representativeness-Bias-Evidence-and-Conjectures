To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event is proportional to the prior probability of the event multiplied by the likelihood of the evidence given the event.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and F be the event that the attacker is female. Let W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

We are given:
P(M) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male)
P(F) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is female)

We are also given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. Therefore, we can write:

P(W|M) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is male)
P(W|F) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is female)

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(M|W) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

Calculating this value, we get:

P(M|W) = 0.4706

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4706.
