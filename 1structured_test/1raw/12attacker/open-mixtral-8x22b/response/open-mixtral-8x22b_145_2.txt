To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is "the attacker is male" and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker's gender.

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male
- P(M) as the prior probability that the attacker is male, which we know is 15% or 0.15 based on the population statistics
- P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 80% or 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy
- P(W|not M) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 20% or 0.2 based on the witness's error rate

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

We know P(not M) is the probability that the attacker is female, which is 85% or 0.85 based on the population statistics. Now we can plug in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
