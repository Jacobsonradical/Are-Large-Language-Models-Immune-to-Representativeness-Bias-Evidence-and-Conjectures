To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge or beliefs. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem is stated as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred (this is what we want to find)
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has already occurred (this is given in the problem)
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A (this is given in the problem)
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B (this can be calculated using the law of total probability)

Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female, so 15% is male)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is female)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time)

We need to find P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Now we can substitute the given values into the equation:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.5714

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.5714.

Answer: {probability: 0.5714}
