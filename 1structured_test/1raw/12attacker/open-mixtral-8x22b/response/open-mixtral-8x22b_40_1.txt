To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

Let's denote the following:
- M: the attacker is male
- F: the attacker is female
- W: the witness identifies the attacker as male

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

From the given information, we know:
- P(M) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

Here's the answer in the requested dictionary format:
{probability: 0.4138}
