To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, which in this case is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A, which is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 in this case (from point a).
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be calculated by considering both the scenario where the attacker is male and the witness is correct (0.15 * 0.80) and the scenario where the attacker is female and the witness makes an error (0.85 * 0.20).

So, the calculation would be:

P(A|B) = [(0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))]

Let's calculate that:

P(A|B) = [(0.12) / ((0.12) + (0.17))]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
