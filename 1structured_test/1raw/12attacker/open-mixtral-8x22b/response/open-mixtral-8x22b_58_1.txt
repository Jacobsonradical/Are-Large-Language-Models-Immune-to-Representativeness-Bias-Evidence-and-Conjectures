Based on the Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

Let's denote:
P(M) = probability that a random person is male = 0.15
P(F) = probability that a random person is female = 0.85
P(I|M) = probability that the witness identifies the person as male given that the person is male = 0.80
P(I|F) = probability that the witness identifies the person as male given that the person is female = 0.20

We want to find P(M|I), the probability that the person is male given that the witness identified them as male.

P(M|I) = P(I|M) \* P(M) / (P(I|M) \* P(M) + P(I|F) \* P(F))

Substituting the given values:

P(M|I) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / (0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.32

So, the probability that the attacker is male, based on the given information, is approximately 0.32 or 32%.

Final answer:
{
  "probability": 0.32
