To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used to calculate conditional probabilities, which in this case is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male
- P(M) as the probability that any person in the city is male (0.15)
- P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male (0.80)
- P(W|~M) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male (0.20)

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)]

Where:
- P(M|W) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male (the value we want to find)
- P(~M) is the probability that any person in the city is female (0.85)

Now, let's plug in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

P(M|W) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)]

P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

Here is the answer in the requested format:

{probability: 0.41}
