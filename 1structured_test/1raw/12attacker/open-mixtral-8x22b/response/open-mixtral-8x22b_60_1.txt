To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of information: the prior probability (the distribution of gender in the population) and the likelihood (the witness's ability to correctly identify gender).

Prior probability (P(M)):
- P(M) = 0.15 (the probability of being male in the population)
- P(F) = 0.85 (the probability of being female in the population)

Likelihood (P(E|M) and P(E|F)):
- P(E|M) = 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male)
- P(E|F) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

Posterior probability (P(M|E)):
- P(M|E) = P(E|M) * P(M) / [P(E|M) * P(M) + P(E|F) * P(F)]

Now, let's calculate the posterior probability:

P(M|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.41379

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the information, is approximately 0.41379 or 41.379%.

Final answer in the required format:
{probability: 0.41379}
