To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes the process of updating probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- M: the attacker is male
- F: the attacker is female
- W: the witness identified the attacker as male

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(M) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness identifies a male as male)
- P(W|F) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a female as male)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Substituting the given probabilities:
P(M|W) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.3478

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.3478.
