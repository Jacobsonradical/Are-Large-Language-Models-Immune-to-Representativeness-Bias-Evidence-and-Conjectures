To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

First, let's define some variables:

- M: The attacker is male.
- F: The attacker is female.
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities:

1. P(M): The prior probability that the attacker is male, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
2. P(F): The prior probability that the attacker is female, which is given as 85% or 0.85.
3. P(W|M): The probability that the witness identified the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 80% or 0.8.
4. P(W|F): The probability that the witness identified the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is the error rate of 20% or 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) \* P(M) / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

After calculating, we get:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.3478

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.3478 or 34.78%.

Final answer:
{
  "probability": 0.3478,
  "explanation": "The probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 34.78%."
