To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- M: The event that the attacker is male
- F: The event that the attacker is female
- W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as male

Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we have:

P(M) = 0.15
P(F) = 0.85

The witness's accuracy in identifying a person's gender is given as 80%, with a 20% error rate. Thus, the probability that the witness identifies a person as male (W), given that the person is indeed male (M), is:

P(W|M) = 0.80

Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, he is incorrect 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the witness identifies a person as male (W), given that the person is female (F), is:

P(W|F) = 0.20

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is male (M), given that the witness identified the attacker as male (W):

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(M|W) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

Here's the dictionary format:
