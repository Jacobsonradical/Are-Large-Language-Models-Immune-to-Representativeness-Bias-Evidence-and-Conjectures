To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let M be the event that the attacker is male and F be the event that the attacker is female. Let W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, we calculate the prior probability that the attacker is male, P(M), and female, P(F), based on the city's population demographics:

P(M) = 0.15
P(F) = 0.85

Next, we calculate the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male, P(W|M), and female, P(W|F):

P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability, P(M|W), that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Substituting the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.3529

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.3529 or 35.29%.
