To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B (the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement)
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A (the probability that the witness identified a person as male given that they are indeed male)
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A (the probability that a random person in the city is male)
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B (the probability that the witness identifies a person as male)

From the given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (80% of the time the witness correctly identifies males)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)
- P(B) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies a person as male, given 15% of the population is male and 85% is female)

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

And finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
