To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- P(W|~M) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female.
- P(M|W) as the posterior probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to the information given:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
- P(W|~M) = 0.2 (the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases)

We want to find P(M|W), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)]

We know that P(~M) = 1 - P(M) = 0.85, since 85% of the population is female.

Substituting the known values:

P(M|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the numerator:
0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Calculating the denominator:
0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
