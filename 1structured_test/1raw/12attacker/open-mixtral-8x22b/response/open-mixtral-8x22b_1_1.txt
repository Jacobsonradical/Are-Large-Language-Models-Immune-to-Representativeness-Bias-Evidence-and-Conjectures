To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote M as the event that the attacker is male and W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Given:
P(M) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is male)
P(W|M) = 0.80 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a male)
P(not W|not M) = 0.80 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a female)

We need to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

We know that P(not M) = 0.85 (probability that the attacker is female) and P(W|not M) = 0.20 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).

Now let's compute P(M|W):
P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.3478

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.3478.
