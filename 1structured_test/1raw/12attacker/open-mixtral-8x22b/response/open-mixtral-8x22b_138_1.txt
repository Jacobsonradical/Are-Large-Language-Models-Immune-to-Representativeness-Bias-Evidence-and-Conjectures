To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the prior belief is the base rate of males in the population, which is 15% or 0.15.

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male,
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
- P(M) = 0.15 (base rate of males),
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a male),
- P(W|not M) = 0.20 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).

We are asked for P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express P(M|W) as follows:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) = 0.3478

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.3478.
