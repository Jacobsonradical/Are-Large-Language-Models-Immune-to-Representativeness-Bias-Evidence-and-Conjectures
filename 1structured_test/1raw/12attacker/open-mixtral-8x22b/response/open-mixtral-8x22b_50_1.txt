To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- M: The attacker is male.
- F: The attacker is female.
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:

- P(M) = 0.15 (15% male population)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% female population)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (80% chance of correctly identifying a male)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (20% chance of incorrectly identifying a female as male)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.3175

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.3175.
