To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is male," and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as male."

From the information given, we know that:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is male)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities:
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

P(¬A) is the probability that the attacker is female, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
