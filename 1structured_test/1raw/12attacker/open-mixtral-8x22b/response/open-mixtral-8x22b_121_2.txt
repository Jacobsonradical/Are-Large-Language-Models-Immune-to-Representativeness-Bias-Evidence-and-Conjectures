To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, our hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

First, we need to calculate the probability that a witness identifies a person as male, given that the person is actually male (P(Witness says male | Attacker is male)). According to the given information, the witness is correct 80% of the time.

P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) = 0.8

Next, we need to calculate the probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that the person is actually female (P(Witness says male | Attacker is female)). Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, they are incorrect 20% of the time.

P(Witness says male | Attacker is female) = 0.2

Now, we need to consider the prior probabilities, which are the probabilities of the attacker being male or female without any additional information. According to the given information, 15% of the population is male, and 85% is female.

P(Attacker is male) = 0.15
P(Attacker is female) = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male:

P(Attacker is male | Witness says male) = (P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male)) / (P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness says male | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Attacker is male | Witness says male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(Attacker is male | Witness says male) â‰ˆ 0.357

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, is approximately 0.357.
