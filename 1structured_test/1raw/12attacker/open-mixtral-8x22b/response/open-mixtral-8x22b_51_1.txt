To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker's gender.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

Here,
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male. This is 80% or 0.8.
- P(H) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 15% or 0.15, based on the population distribution.
- P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as male regardless of their actual gender. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time, we can calculate P(E) as follows: P(E) = P(correct identification) + P(incorrect identification of female as male). Given that 85% of the population is female, the witness will incorrectly identify females as males 20% of the time, leading to a probability of 0.85 \* 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, P(E) = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability, P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.124

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.124 or 12.4%.
