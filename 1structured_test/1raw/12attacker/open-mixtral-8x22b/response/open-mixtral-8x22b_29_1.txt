To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the prior probability based on population demographics and the likelihood given the witness's testimony.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the information provided:
P(M) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)

We also know that:
P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

To find the posterior probability P(M|W) - the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male - we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

First, we calculate P(not M), which is the probability that the attacker is not male (i.e., is female):
P(not M) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(M|W) using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.357

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.357.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
