To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, we calculate P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker as male. According to the information given, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, we calculate P(A), which is the prior probability that the attacker is male. According to the information given, 15% of the population in the city is male. So, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we calculate P(B), which is the total probability that the witness identifies an attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's actual gender. This can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Here, P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is not male, which is 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female). And P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male, which is 0.2 (since the witness makes an error 20% of the time).

Substituting these values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41.
