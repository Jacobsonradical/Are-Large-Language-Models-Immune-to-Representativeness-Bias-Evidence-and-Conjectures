To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

First, we calculate the prior probability of the attacker being male based on the population demographics:

Prior probability (Attacker is male) = P(Male) = 0.15

Next, we calculate the likelihood of the witness identifying a person as male given that the person is actually male:

P(Witness identifies as male | Attacker is male) = 0.8

Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, the likelihood of the witness identifying a person as male given that the person is actually female is:

P(Witness identifies as male | Attacker is female) = 0.2

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker is male | Witness identifies as male) = [P(Witness identifies as male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male)] / [P(Witness identifies as male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness identifies as male | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female)]

P(Attacker is male | Witness identifies as male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

After calculating the above expression, we get:

P(Attacker is male | Witness identifies as male) â‰ˆ 0.436

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.436.
