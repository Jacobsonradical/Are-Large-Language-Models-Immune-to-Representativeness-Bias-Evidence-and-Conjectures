To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is useful for updating probabilities based on new evidence.

First, let's define the events:
- M: The attacker is male.
- F: The attacker is female.
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(M) = 0.15, since 15% of the population is male.
- P(F) = 0.85, since 85% of the population is female.
- P(W|M) = 0.80, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male.
- P(W|F) = 0.20, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.

Final answer in the required format:
{probability: 0.4138}
