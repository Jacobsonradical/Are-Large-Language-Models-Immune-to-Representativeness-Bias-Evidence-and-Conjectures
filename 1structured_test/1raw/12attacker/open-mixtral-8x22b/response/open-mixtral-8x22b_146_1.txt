To compute the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- A is the event that the attacker is male.
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as male, given that the person is male.
- P(A) is the prior probability that a random person is male.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as male, regardless of their actual gender.

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time).
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male).
- P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)] = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41, or 41%.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
