To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(Male|Witness Identified Male) = P(Witness Identified Male|Male) * P(Male) / P(Witness Identified Male)

Here, P(Male|Witness Identified Male) is the posterior probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male, P(Witness Identified Male|Male) is the likelihood that the witness identifies a male as male, P(Male) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, and P(Witness Identified Male) is the marginal likelihood.

From the information given:
P(Witness Identified Male|Male) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
P(Male) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)

To calculate P(Witness Identified Male), we can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness Identified Male) = P(Witness Identified Male|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness Identified Male|Female) * P(Female)

Here, P(Witness Identified Male|Female) is the likelihood that the witness identifies a female as male, and P(Female) is the prior probability that the attacker is female.

From the information given:
P(Witness Identified Male|Female) = 0.2 (the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases)
P(Female) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is female)

So, P(Witness Identified Male) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.295

Now, we can calculate P(Male|Witness Identified Male):

P(Male|Witness Identified Male) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.295 â‰ˆ 0.407

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.407.

Answer: {probability: 0.407}
