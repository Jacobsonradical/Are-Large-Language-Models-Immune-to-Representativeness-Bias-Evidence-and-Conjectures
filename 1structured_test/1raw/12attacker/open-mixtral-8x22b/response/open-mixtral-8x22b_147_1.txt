To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is particularly useful for calculating conditional probabilities. Let's denote:

- M as the event that the attacker is male.
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:

- P(W|M), the probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that the person is male: 0.8 (80%).
- P(W|¬M), the probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that the person is not male (i.e., female): 0.2 (20%).
- P(M), the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is male: 0.15 (15%).

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|¬M) * P(¬M)]

Where P(¬M) is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is female, which is 0.85 (85%).

Now, let's plug in the given values:

P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(M|W) ≈ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.41.
