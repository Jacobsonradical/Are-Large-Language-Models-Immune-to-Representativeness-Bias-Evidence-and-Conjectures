To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given that:
P(M) = 0.15 (The probability that a random person is male, which is 15% of the population)
P(W|M) = 0.80 (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is 80%)
P(W|not M) = 0.20 (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 20%)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

Substituting the given values:
P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

Calculating the values:
P(M|W) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) = 0.41379310344827585 (Approximately 41.38%)

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 41.38%.

Here is the answer in the required format:
