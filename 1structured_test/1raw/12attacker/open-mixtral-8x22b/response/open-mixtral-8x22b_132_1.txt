To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male
- P(M) as the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 based on the population statistics
- P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that the person is indeed male, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy
- P(W|not M) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that the person is not male (i.e., female), which is 0.2 based on the witness's error rate

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability P(M|W) that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

Substituting the given values:

P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives approximately 0.443.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.443.

Here is the dictionary format answer:

{
  "probability": 0.443,
  "explanation": "The probability was calculated using Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the prior probability that the attacker is male (0.15), the witness's accuracy in identifying males (0.8), and the witness's error rate in misidentifying females as males (0.2)."
