To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

First, let's denote the following events:

- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

According to the information given:

- P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is male, is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).
- P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time).
- P(B|~A), the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, is 0.2 (since the witness makes errors in 20% of the cases).

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification (P(A|B)) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A))

First, calculate P(~A), the probability that the attacker is not male (i.e., female):

P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now, substitute the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.3058

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.3058.
