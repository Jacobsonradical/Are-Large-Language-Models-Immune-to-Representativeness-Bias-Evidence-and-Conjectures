To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, we establish our prior probability (P(Male)) based on the population demographics:
P(Male) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)

Next, we calculate the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male (P(Witness|Male)):
P(Witness|Male) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)

Then, we calculate the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female (P(Witness|Female)):
P(Witness|Female) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony:

P(Male|Witness) = P(Witness|Male) * P(Male) / [P(Witness|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness|Female) * P(Female)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(Male|Witness) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

Calculating the value:

P(Male|Witness) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(Male|Witness) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(Male|Witness) â‰ˆ 0.41

This means that the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

Here's the answer in the requested dictionary format:
