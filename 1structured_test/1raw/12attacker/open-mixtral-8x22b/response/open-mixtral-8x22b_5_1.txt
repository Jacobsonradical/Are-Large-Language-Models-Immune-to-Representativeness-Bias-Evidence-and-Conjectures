To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

where:
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the total probability of the evidence

Let's denote "H" as the hypothesis that the attacker is male and "E" as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Given the information:
- The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. Therefore, P(E|H) = 0.8 and P(E|~H) = 0.2.
- The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. Therefore, P(H) = 0.15 and P(~H) = 0.85.

Now, we calculate P(E):
P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.27

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E):
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.27
       = 0.444

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.444 or 44.4%.
