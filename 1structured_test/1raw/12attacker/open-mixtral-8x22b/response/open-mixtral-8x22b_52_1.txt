To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

The prior probability (P(Male)) is given by the population demographics, which is 0.15. The likelihood (P(Witness Identification|Male)) is given by the witness's accuracy in identifying males, which is 0.8. The likelihood (P(Witness Identification|Female)) is given by the witness's error rate in identifying females as males, which is 0.2.

Bayes' theorem can be written as:

P(Male|Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification|Male) * P(Male) / [P(Witness Identification|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness Identification|Female) * P(Female)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(Male|Witness Identification) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us approximately 0.45.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.45.
