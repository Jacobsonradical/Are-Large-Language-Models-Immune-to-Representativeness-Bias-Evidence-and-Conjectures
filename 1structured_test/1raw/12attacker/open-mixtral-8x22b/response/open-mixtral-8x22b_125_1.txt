To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male, and let M be the event that the attacker is male.

First, we calculate the likelihood P(A|M), which is the probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that the person is indeed male. According to the information provided, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. Therefore, P(A|M) = 0.8.

Next, we calculate the likelihood P(A|~M), which is the probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that the person is not male (i.e., the person is female). Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time, this means that when the person is female, there is a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify them as male. Therefore, P(A|~M) = 0.2.

Now we need to find the prior probability P(M), which is the probability of the attacker being male based on the population demographics. According to the information provided, 15% of the city's population is male. Therefore, P(M) = 0.15.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability P(M|A), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. By Bayes' theorem:

P(M|A) = P(A|M) * P(M) / [P(A|M) * P(M) + P(A|~M) * P(~M)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(M|A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(M|A) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|A) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|A) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population demographics, is approximately 0.41.
