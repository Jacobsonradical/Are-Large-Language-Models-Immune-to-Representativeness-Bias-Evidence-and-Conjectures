To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is particularly useful when we want to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is based on the population demographics, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) \* P(M)] / [P(W|M) \* P(M) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Where:
- P(M|W) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony.
- P(W|M) is the probability of the witness identifying a male as male (80%).
- P(M) is the prior probability that the attacker is male (15%).
- P(W|F) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male (20% of the time the witness makes an error, and since half of the population is female, 10% of the time the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).
- P(F) is the prior probability that the attacker is female (85%).

Now, let's plug in the values:

P(M|W) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.1 \* 0.85)]

P(M|W) = 0.12 / [(0.12) + (0.085)]

P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.205

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.585

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.585, or 58.5%.

Here's the dictionary format:
