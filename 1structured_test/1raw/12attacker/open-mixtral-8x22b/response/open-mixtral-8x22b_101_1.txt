To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- M: The attacker is male.
- F: The attacker is female.
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

From the information given:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Now, we can plug these values into the equation:
P(M|W) = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4348

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male based on the given information is approximately 0.4348.

Here is the final answer in the requested dictionary format:
