To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory. It describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male.
- W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
- P(M), the prior probability that the attacker is male, is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).
- P(not M), the prior probability that the attacker is female, is 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female).
- P(W|M), the probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that the person is male, is 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time).
- P(W|not M), the probability that the witness identifies a person as male given that the person is female, is 0.2 (since the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases).

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M))

Substituting the given values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

After calculating, the result is approximately 0.4118.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4118.

Answer in the required format: {probability: 0.4118}
