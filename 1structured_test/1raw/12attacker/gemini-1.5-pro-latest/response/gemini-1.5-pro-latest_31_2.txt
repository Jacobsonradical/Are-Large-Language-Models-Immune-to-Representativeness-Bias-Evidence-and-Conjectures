{
"probability": 0.62
} 

**Explanation:**

We can solve this using Bayes' Theorem. Here's how:

* **Define Events:**
    * Let "M" be the event that the attacker is male.
    * Let "F" be the event that the attacker is female.
    * Let "W" be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

* **State Probabilities:**
    *  P(M) = 0.15 (Prior probability of the attacker being male, based on city demographics)
    *  P(F) = 0.85 (Prior probability of the attacker being female)
    *  P(W|M) = 0.8 (Likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male as male)
    *  P(W|F) = 0.2 (Likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

* **Bayes' Theorem:** 
    We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.  Bayes' Theorem states:

    P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

    To find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

    P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M)  +  P(W|F) * P(F)
    P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

* **Calculate:**
    Now we have everything to apply Bayes' Theorem:

    P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
    P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.62

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness testimony and population demographics, is approximately 0.62 or 62%.**
