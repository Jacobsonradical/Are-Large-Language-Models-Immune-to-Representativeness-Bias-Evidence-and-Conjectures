Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in identifying gender under similar conditions. This means their testimony isn't perfect.
* **Population Demographics:** The city's population is predominantly female (85%). This information is crucial for calculating the overall probability.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to incorporate both pieces of evidence. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's define the events:

* **Event A:** The attacker is male.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is male *given* the witness said they were.

Here's how to break down the calculation:

1. **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would identify the attacker as male *if* the attacker is actually male. This is the witness's accuracy rate for identifying males, which is 80% or 0.8.

2. **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male. This is based on the city's demographics, which is 15% or 0.15.

3. **P(B):** The probability the witness would identify the attacker as male (regardless of the attacker's actual gender).  We need to calculate this considering both scenarios (attacker is male and attacker is female):
   *  P(B, attacker is male) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
   *  P(B, attacker is female) = P(B|attacker is female) * P(attacker is female) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
   *  P(B) = P(B, attacker is male) + P(B, attacker is female) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
          â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Despite the witness identifying the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is actually male is only around 41.4%.  This is significantly influenced by the fact that the city's population is predominantly female.
