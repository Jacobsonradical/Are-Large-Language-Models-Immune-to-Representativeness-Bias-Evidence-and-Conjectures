**Explanation:**

We need to combine the witness's reliability with the general population statistics using Bayes' Theorem. Here's how:

* **Let "Male" be the event that the attacker is male.**
* **Let "Witness Says Male" be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.**

**We want to find P(Male | Witness Says Male), the probability the attacker is male given the witness said so.**

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(Male | Witness Says Male) = [P(Witness Says Male | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness Says Male)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Witness Says Male | Male) = 0.8**  (The witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
* **P(Male) = 0.15** (15% of the population is male)
* **P(Witness Says Male)** is more complex. The witness could say "male" correctly or incorrectly. We need to consider both:
    * **P(Witness Says Male correctly) = P(Male) * P(Witness Says Male | Male) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12**
    * **P(Witness Says Male incorrectly) = P(Not Male) * P(Witness Says Male | Not Male) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17** 
    * **Therefore: P(Witness Says Male) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

**Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Male | Witness Says Male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness testimony and the city's demographics, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
