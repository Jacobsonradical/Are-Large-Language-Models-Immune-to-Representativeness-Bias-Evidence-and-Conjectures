Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to update our prior belief about the attacker's gender (based on population statistics) with new evidence from the witness.

**Let's define some terms:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is male.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**We are given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of the population is male)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Likelihood: If the attacker is male, the witness correctly identifies them as male 80% of the time)
* **P(B| not A) = 0.20** (Likelihood: If the attacker is female, the witness incorrectly identifies them as male 20% of the time)

**We want to find:**

* **P(A|B)** (Posterior probability: The probability the attacker is male *given* the witness identified them as male)

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)] 

**Calculations**

1. **P(not A) = 0.85** (Since 85% of the population is female)
2. **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**
3. **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.4%.**
