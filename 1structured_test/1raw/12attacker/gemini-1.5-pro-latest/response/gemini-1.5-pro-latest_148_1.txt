Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** The information about the city's population (85% female, 15% male) gives us the *prior probability* of the attacker being male.  This is our belief *before* considering the witness testimony.
* **Witness Reliability:** The witness's 80% accuracy rate is crucial. This tells us how much to update our belief based on their testimony.
* **Bayes' Theorem:** This theorem helps us combine prior probability with new evidence (the witness testimony) to calculate the *posterior probability* â€“ our updated belief about the attacker being male.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let:

* Event M = Attacker is male
* Event F = Attacker is female
* Event W = Witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male *given* the witness said so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(W|M) = Probability the witness would say "male" *if* the attacker is male (this is 0.8, the witness's accuracy)
* P(M) = Prior probability of the attacker being male (this is 0.15)
* P(W) = Probability of the witness saying "male", regardless of the attacker's actual gender.

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both scenarios (attacker is male, attacker is female):

P(W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] + [P(W|F) * P(F)]

* P(W|F) = Probability the witness would say "male" *if* the attacker is female (this is 0.2, the witness's error rate)
* P(F) = Prior probability of the attacker being female (this is 0.85)

**Calculation**

1. **P(W):** 
   P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **P(M|W):**
   P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as male, the relatively low prior probability of males in the city means our updated belief is only around 41.4%. It's important to weigh both prior information and the reliability of new evidence.
