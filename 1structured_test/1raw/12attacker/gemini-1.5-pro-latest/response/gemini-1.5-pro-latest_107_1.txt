**Explanation:**

We can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief about the attacker's gender (based on population statistics) with the new evidence from the witness.

* **Prior probability (P(Male))**:  The probability that the attacker is male based purely on the city's demographics is 15% or 0.15.
* **Likelihood (P(Witness Correct | Male))**: This is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male *given* the attacker is actually male. This is 80% or 0.8 according to the information provided.
* **Likelihood (P(Witness Correct | Female))**: This is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male *given* the attacker is actually female. This is 20% or 0.2 (the error rate).
* **Prior probability (P(Female))**: The probability that the attacker is female based on demographics is 85% or 0.85.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Male | Witness Correct) = [P(Witness Correct | Male) * P(Male)]  / P(Witness Correct)

To calculate the denominator, we use the law of total probability:

P(Witness Correct) = [P(Witness Correct | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness Correct | Female) * P(Female)]
P(Witness Correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally, plugging back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Male | Witness Correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness testimony and population statistics, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.  Rounding this to the nearest tenth gives us our answer of 0.62 or 62%. **
