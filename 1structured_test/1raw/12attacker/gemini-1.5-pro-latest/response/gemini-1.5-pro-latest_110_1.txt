Here's how to approach this problem, with the caveat that this is a simplified model:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in identifying gender under similar conditions. This means they are more likely to be right than wrong, but there's still a 20% chance of error.
* **Population Demographics:**  The city's population is predominantly female (85%). This means a randomly chosen person from the city is more likely to be female.

**Combining the Information**

We need to weigh the witness's testimony against the baseline probability of a person in the city being male. Here's one way to think about it:

1. **Prior Probability:**  Before the witness testimony, the probability of the attacker being male is 15% (based on the city's demographics).

2. **Witness Adjustment:** The witness provides evidence that increases the likelihood of the attacker being male. However, their testimony isn't perfect.

**Calculating the Estimate**

It's difficult to give a precise numerical probability without using Bayesian reasoning, which provides a formal way to update probabilities given new evidence. However, we can provide a qualitative estimate:

* **The probability of the attacker being male is higher than 15%.** This is because the witness, while not perfect, leans towards identifying the attacker as male. 
* **The probability is likely closer to 80% than 15%.**  The witness's testimony carries more weight than the base rate of males in the population.

**Important Note:**  It is crucial to recognize the limitations of this estimate:

* **Simplified Model:** We are making assumptions about the independence of the witness's accuracy and the population demographics. In reality, there could be other factors at play.
* **Ethical Considerations:**  Using this type of calculation in a real-life criminal case is highly sensitive. Over-reliance on witness testimony (even when statistically adjusted) can contribute to bias and miscarriages of justice.

**Answer (Qualitative):**  While a precise numerical probability is difficult to determine, it's reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being male is significantly higher than 15%, likely closer to 80%.
