Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in identifying gender under similar conditions. This means their statement isn't foolproof.
* **Population Demographics:** The city's population is predominantly female (85%). This is important base rate information.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to combine the witness testimony with the base rate information using Bayes' Theorem. Here's a breakdown:

* **Let "M" be the event that the attacker is male.**
* **Let "W" be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.**

We want to find **P(M|W): the probability the attacker is male given the witness said it was a male.**

**Bayes' Theorem states:**
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|M):** The probability the witness would say "male" given the attacker *is* male. This is their accuracy rate for identifying males, which is 0.8. 
* **P(M):** The prior probability of the attacker being male, based on the population. This is 0.15.
* **P(W):** The probability the witness would say "male" (regardless of the attacker's actual gender).  This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M)  +  P(W|~M) * P(~M) 
    * Where "~M" represents the event that the attacker is not male (i.e., female).
    * P(W|~M) is the probability the witness would mistakenly identify a female attacker as male, which is 0.2 (their error rate).
    * P(~M) is the probability the attacker is female, which is 0.85.

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(W):** 
   * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(M|W):**
   * P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**
{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Despite the witness identifying the attacker as male, the probability of the attacker actually being male is only around 41.4%.  This is significantly influenced by the fact that the city has a much higher proportion of females.
