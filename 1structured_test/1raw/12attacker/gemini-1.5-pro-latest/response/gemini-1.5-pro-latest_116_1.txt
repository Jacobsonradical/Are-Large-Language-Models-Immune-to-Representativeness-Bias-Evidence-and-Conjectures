Here's how to approach this problem, along with the calculation:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% chance of being right about the attacker's gender and a 20% chance of being wrong.
* **Base Rates:** The city's population has a higher percentage of females (85%) than males (15%). This is important background information.

**We need to use Bayes' Theorem to combine this information. Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our beliefs about an event (attacker being male) given new evidence (witness testimony).**

**Let's break it down:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is male.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is male *given* the witness said it was male.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would say "male" *if* the attacker *is* male. This is their accuracy rate for identifying males = 0.8 (80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male. This is where the population information comes in = 0.15 (15%).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness would say "male" (regardless of whether the attacker is actually male or female). This is calculated as follows:

    * P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)]
    * Where ~A means "attacker is not male" (i.e., female)
    * P(B|~A): Probability the witness would say "male" if the attacker is female (their error rate for females) = 0.2 (20%)
    * P(~A): Probability the attacker is female = 0.85 (85%)

**Calculation**

1. **P(B):** (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 
2. **P(A|B):** (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.4%.**
