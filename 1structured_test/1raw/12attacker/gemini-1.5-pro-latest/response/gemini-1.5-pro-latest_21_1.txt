Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in determining gender under similar conditions. This doesn't directly tell us the attacker's gender, just how reliable the witness is.
* **Population Demographics:** The city's population is predominantly female (85%). This is important background information.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to combine the witness testimony with the prior knowledge (population demographics) to get a more accurate estimate.

Here's a simplified way to think about it:

1. **Scenario 1: Attacker is Male** 
   *  Probability of a male attacker given the city's demographics: 0.15 (15%)
   *  Probability the witness would correctly identify them as male: 0.8 (80%)

2. **Scenario 2: Attacker is Female**
   * Probability of a female attacker given the city's demographics: 0.85 (85%)
   * Probability the witness would incorrectly identify them as male: 0.2 (20%)

Now, we need to weigh these scenarios:

* **Weighted Probability of Scenario 1 (Male):** 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
* **Weighted Probability of Scenario 2 (Female):** 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

To get the probability of the attacker being male *given* the witness said it was a male, we normalize:

* **Total Weighted Probability:** 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
* **Probability (Attacker is Male | Witness said Male):** 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:**  This calculation simplifies a complex problem.  Other factors could influence the true probability, and eye-witness testimony is notoriously unreliable.
