"probability": 0.52

**Explanation:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior belief (the city's gender distribution) with the new evidence from the witness testimony.

* **Prior Probability (P(Male)):** The initial probability that the attacker is male based solely on the city's demographics (15%) is 0.15.
* **Likelihood (P(Witness Correct | Male)):** The probability that the witness would correctly identify the attacker as male, given the attacker is indeed male, is 80% or 0.8.
* **Likelihood (P(Witness Correct | Female)):** The probability that the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as male, given the attacker is actually female, is 20% or 0.2.
* **Prior Probability (P(Female)):** The initial probability that the attacker is female based solely on the city's demographics (85%) is 0.85.

**Bayes' Theorem Calculation:**

P(Male | Witness Correct) = [P(Witness Correct | Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Witness Correct | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness Correct | Female) * P(Female)]

P(Male | Witness Correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.52

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness testimony and city demographics, is 52%.**
