Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let "M" be the event that the attacker is male.
*  Let "F" be the event that the attacker is female.
*  Let "W" be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. State Prior Probabilities**

*  P(M) = 0.15 (Prior probability of the attacker being male based on population)
*  P(F) = 0.85 (Prior probability of the attacker being female based on population)

**3. State Likelihoods**

*  P(W|M) = 0.80 (Probability the witness identifies male given the attacker is male)
*  P(W|F) = 0.20 (Probability the witness identifies male given the attacker is female)

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness's identification. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

To find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] + [P(W|F) * P(F)]
P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate Posterior Probability**

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony and the city's demographics, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.4%.
