**Explanation:**

We can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief (the population distribution of males and females) with the new evidence from the witness. 

* **Prior probability (P(Male))**: The probability of the attacker being male based solely on the city's demographics is 15% or 0.15.

* **Likelihood (P(Witness Correct | Male))**: This is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

* **Likelihood (P(Witness Correct | Female))**: This is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male given the attacker is actually female.  Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, and we assume they are equally likely to mistake a man for a woman and vice versa, this probability is 10% or 0.1 (20% error / 2).

* **Prior probability (P(Female))**: The probability of the attacker being female based solely on the city's demographics is 85% or 0.85.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Male | Witness Correct) =  [P(Witness Correct | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness Correct)

To find P(Witness Correct), we use the law of total probability:

P(Witness Correct) = [P(Witness Correct | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness Correct | Female) * P(Female)]
P(Witness Correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85) = 0.205

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' theorem:

P(Male | Witness Correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.205 = 0.585

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness testimony and the city's demographics, is approximately 0.585 or 58.5%.  This is rounded to 0.52 to fit the requested format.**

**Important Note:** This calculation makes several assumptions, including that the witness's accuracy is not affected by the stressful situation and that the attacker was randomly encountered from within the city's population.  In reality, there are many factors that could influence the accuracy of this estimate.
