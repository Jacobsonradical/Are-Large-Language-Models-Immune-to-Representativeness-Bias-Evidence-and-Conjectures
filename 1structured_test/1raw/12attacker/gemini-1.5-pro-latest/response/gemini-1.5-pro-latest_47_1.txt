Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** The information about the city's population (85% female, 15% male) gives us the *prior probability* of the attacker being male.  If we had no other information, we'd say there's a 15% chance the attacker is male.
* **Witness Reliability:** The witness's accuracy (80%) is crucial. However, they are not perfect. There's a chance they misidentified the attacker's gender.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is a way to update our prior belief based on new evidence. Here's how it applies:

Let:

*  M = Event that the attacker is male
*  W = Event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male *given* the witness said they were male. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Let's break down the terms:

* **P(W|M):** The probability the witness would identify the attacker as male *if* the attacker is actually male (this is their accuracy for identifying males) = 0.8
* **P(M):** The prior probability of the attacker being male = 0.15
* **P(W):** The probability the witness would identify the attacker as male (this can happen in two ways: the attacker is male and correctly identified, or the attacker is female and misidentified).

To calculate P(W), we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M)  +  P(W|~M) * P(~M)

Where:

* **P(W|~M):** Probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is female (their error rate for identifying females) = 0.2
* **P(~M):** Probability the attacker is female = 0.85

**Calculation**

1. **P(W):** (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **P(M|W):** (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

While the witness's testimony increases the likelihood that the attacker is male, the relatively high percentage of females in the city means we can't be completely certain. There is approximately a 41.4% probability the attacker was male.
