Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**1. Prior Probability (from population statistics):**

* Before considering the witness testimony, the probability of the attacker being male is simply the percentage of males in the city's population: **0.15** 

**2. Witness Reliability:**

* The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender under similar conditions. This means:
    * If the attacker *was* male, there's an 80% chance the witness would correctly identify them as male.
    * If the attacker *was not* male (i.e., female), there's a 20% chance the witness would incorrectly identify them as male.

**3. Combining the Information (Bayes' Theorem):**

To get a more accurate probability estimate, we need to combine the prior probability with the witness's reliability. Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for this. However, without diving into the formula, we can use logical reasoning:

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is male (15% probability).**  There's an 80% chance the witness would correctly identify this. So, this scenario contributes 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 to the overall probability of the witness saying "male."

* **Scenario 2: Attacker is female (85% probability).** There's a 20% chance the witness would incorrectly identify this as male.  This scenario contributes 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 to the overall probability of the witness saying "male."

* **Total Probability of Witness Saying "Male":** The witness will say "male" in approximately 12% + 17% = 29% of similar cases.

* **Final Estimate:** Out of the 29% of cases where the witness says "male," 12% are actually because the attacker is male.  Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement is approximately 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.41 

**{probability: 0.41}** 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation. Bayes' Theorem provides a more rigorous way to calculate this, but the logic remains the same.
