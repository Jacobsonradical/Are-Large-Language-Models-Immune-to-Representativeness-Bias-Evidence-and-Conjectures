"probability": 0.62

**Explanation:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability:

* Let "M" be the event that the attacker is male.
* Let "F" be the event that the attacker is female.
* Let "W" be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness said it was a male.

**Bayes' Theorem states:** P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|M):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is male. This is the witness's accuracy for identifying males, which is 80% or 0.8.

* **P(M):** The prior probability of the attacker being male.  This is based on the city's demographics, which is 15% or 0.15.

* **P(W):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as male (regardless of the attacker's actual gender). This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
         = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness testimony and the city's demographics, is approximately **0.62** or **62%**.
