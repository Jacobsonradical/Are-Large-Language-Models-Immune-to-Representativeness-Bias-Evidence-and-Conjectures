**Explanation:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior belief about the attacker's gender (based on population statistics) with the new evidence from the witness. 

* **Prior probability (P(Male))**: The initial probability of the attacker being male based purely on population demographics is 15% or 0.15.
* **Likelihood (P(Witness Correct | Male))**: This is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male *given* the attacker is actually male. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
* **Likelihood (P(Witness Correct | Female))**: This is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male *given* the attacker is actually female. This would be the witness's error rate of 20% or 0.2.
* **Prior probability (P(Female))**: The initial probability of the attacker being female based on population demographics is 85% or 0.85.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Male | Witness Correct) = [P(Witness Correct | Male) * P(Male)] / [ (P(Witness Correct | Male) * P(Male)) + (P(Witness Correct | Female) * P(Female)) ]

P(Male | Witness Correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) 
P(Male | Witness Correct) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(Male | Witness Correct) ≈ 0.414

However, this only considers the cases where the witness identifies the attacker as male.  Since the witness is right 80% of the time, we need to adjust our final probability:

Final Probability ≈ 0.414 * 0.8 + (1-0.414) * 0.2 ≈ **0.52** 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 52%.**
