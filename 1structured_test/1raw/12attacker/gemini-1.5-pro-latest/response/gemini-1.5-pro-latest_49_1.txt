Here's how to approach this problem, combining population statistics with witness reliability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** The information about the city's population gives us a prior probability. Before considering the witness, there's a 15% chance the attacker is male simply based on demographics.
* **Witness Reliability:** The witness isn't perfect. While they identified the attacker as male, there's a chance they were mistaken.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is a way to update our belief about an event (attacker being male) given new evidence (witness testimony). 

Let:

*  M = Event that the attacker is male
*  F = Event that the attacker is female
*  W = Event that the witness identified the attacker as male

**We want to find P(M|W): the probability the attacker is male given the witness said so.**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Where:

* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (Probability the witness would identify the attacker as male IF the attacker is actually male)
* **P(M) = 0.15**  (Prior probability of the attacker being male based on the city's population)
* **P(W)** =  Probability of the witness saying "male" in general. We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(W)**

The witness could say "male" in two ways:

1.  The attacker IS male, and the witness is CORRECT:  P(M) * P(W|M) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
2.  The attacker is FEMALE, but the witness is INCORRECT: P(F) * P(W|F) = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

Therefore: 
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we have everything to apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
         = 0.12 / 0.29
         â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability the attacker is actually male is only around 41.4%. This is because the relatively low proportion of males in the population significantly influences the final probability.
