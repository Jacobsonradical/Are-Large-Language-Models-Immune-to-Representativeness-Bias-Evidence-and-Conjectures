Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:**  The information about the city's population (85% female, 15% male) gives us the *prior probability* of the attacker being male. This is our starting point before considering the witness testimony.
* **Witness Reliability:** The witness's 80% accuracy rate tells us how much we can trust their observation. This is crucial for updating our initial belief.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating probabilities based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A (attacker is male) given that event B (witness said male) has occurred.
* P(B|A): Probability of event B (witness said male) given that event A (attacker is male) is true. This is the witness's accuracy for identifying males (80% or 0.8).
* P(A): Prior probability of event A (attacker is male), which is 0.15.
* P(B): Probability of event B (witness said male). This can be calculated using the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Where:

* P(B|~A): Probability of the witness saying "male" when the attacker is actually female. This is the witness's error rate (20% or 0.2).
* P(~A): Probability of the attacker not being male (being female), which is 0.85.

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we have all the pieces to apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as male, the relatively low prior probability of a male attacker in the city means our final estimate of the probability is significantly lower than the witness's accuracy rate.
