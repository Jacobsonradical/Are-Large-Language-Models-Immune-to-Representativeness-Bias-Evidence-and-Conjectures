Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in identifying gender under similar conditions. This means their identification isn't perfect.
* **Base Rate:** The city's population has a higher percentage of females (85%) than males (15%). This base rate is important to consider.

**Reasoning**

We need to combine the witness's testimony with the base rate information.  It's tempting to simply go with the witness's 80% accuracy. However, because there are significantly more females in the city, it's more likely that a random attacker would be female.

**A Simplified Approach (Not entirely accurate):**

One way to get a rough estimate is to adjust the witness's accuracy based on the base rate difference:

* **Difference:** The base rate favors females by 70% (85% female - 15% male). 
* **Adjustment:**  We could very roughly subtract a portion of this difference from the witness's accuracy.  Let's say we take away half of the difference (70% / 2 = 35%).  
* **Adjusted Probability:** 80% (witness accuracy) - 35% (adjustment) = 45% estimated probability the attacker is male.

**Important Note:** This is a highly simplified way to illustrate the concept. A more accurate calculation would involve Bayesian reasoning, which is a bit more complex. 

**Answer (Simplified Estimate):**

{probability: 0.45} 

**Disclaimer:** This is a rough estimate. A precise calculation requires more sophisticated statistical methods.
