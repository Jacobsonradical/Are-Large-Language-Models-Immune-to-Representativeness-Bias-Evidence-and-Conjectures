Here's how to approach this problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in identifying gender under similar conditions. This means their testimony has weight, but it's not foolproof.
* **Base Rate:** The city's population is predominantly female (85%). This base rate is crucial information.

**Calculating the Probability**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine the witness testimony with the base rate:

**Bayes' Theorem (simplified):**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A):  Prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B):  Prior probability of event B happening.

**Let's apply this to our problem:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is male.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being male (base rate) = 0.15 
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given the attacker is actually male (witness reliability) = 0.80
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (this can happen in two ways: the attacker is male and correctly identified, or the attacker is female and incorrectly identified).

     * P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
     * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.4%.**
