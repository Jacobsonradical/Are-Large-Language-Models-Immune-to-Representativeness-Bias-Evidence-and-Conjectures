Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to update our prior belief about the attacker's gender (based on the city's demographics) with new evidence from the witness.

**Let's define some events:**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**We are given:**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (Prior probability of the attacker being male)
* **P(F) = 0.85** (Prior probability of the attacker being female)
* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (Probability the witness identifies male given the attacker is male)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (Probability the witness identifies male given the attacker is female)

**We want to find:**

* **P(M|W):** The probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)
```

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:

```
P(W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] + [P(W|F) * P(F)]
```

**Calculations**

1. **P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29** 

2. **P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.4%.
