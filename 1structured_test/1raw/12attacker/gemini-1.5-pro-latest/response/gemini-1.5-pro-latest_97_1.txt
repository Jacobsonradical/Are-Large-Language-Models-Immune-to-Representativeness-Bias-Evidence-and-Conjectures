Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into manageable steps:

**1. Understand the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in identifying gender under similar conditions. This means they are more likely to be right than wrong, but there's still a chance of error.
* **Population Demographics:** The city's population is predominantly female (85%). This is important background information.

**2. The Key Concept: Bayes' Theorem**

This problem involves revising probabilities based on new evidence. Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B happened. 
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**3. Applying Bayes' Theorem to the Problem**

Let's define:

* Event A: The attacker is male.
* Event B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B) - the probability the attacker is male given the witness said so.

Here's how the probabilities break down:

* **P(B|A):** If the attacker is male, the probability the witness correctly identified them is 0.8 (80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% based on the city's demographics).
* **P(B):**  This is the probability the witness would identify someone as male regardless of the attacker's actual gender. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**4. Calculation**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Important Note:** While the witness's testimony provides some evidence, the probability that the attacker is male is still significantly influenced by the low proportion of males in the population.
