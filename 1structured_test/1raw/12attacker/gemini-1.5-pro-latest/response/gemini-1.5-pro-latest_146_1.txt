Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** The information about the city's population gives us the *prior probability* of the attacker being male (15%) or female (85%).  This is our baseline before considering the witness testimony.
* **Witness Reliability:** The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender under similar conditions. This is important for determining how much we should update our belief based on their testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating our beliefs given new evidence. Here's how it applies to this problem:

Let:

*  "M" be the event that the attacker is male
*  "W" be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male *given* the witness said it was.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(M):** Prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15)
* **P(W|M):** Probability the witness would say "male" *given* the attacker is actually male (0.80, the witness's accuracy rate)
* **P(W):** Probability of the witness saying "male" (This can happen in two ways: the attacker is male and the witness is correct, OR the attacker is female and the witness is incorrect).

To calculate P(W), we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)

Where:

* **P(W|~M):** Probability the witness says "male" *given* the attacker is female (0.20, the witness's error rate)
* **P(~M):** Probability the attacker is female (0.85)

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(W):** 
   P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(M|W):**
   P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

While the city has a low percentage of males, the witness's testimony significantly increases the probability that the attacker was male to approximately 41.4%.
