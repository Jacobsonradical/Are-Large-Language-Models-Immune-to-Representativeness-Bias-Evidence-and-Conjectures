**Explanation:**

While it's tempting to lean heavily on the population statistics, the eyewitness testimony is crucial and shouldn't be disregarded. Here's how we can combine the information:

* **Consider the witness's accuracy:** The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying gender under similar conditions. This means their testimony significantly increases the likelihood that the attacker is indeed male.

* **Factor in the base rate:**  The population split (85% female, 15% male) is considered the "base rate."  While important, it shouldn't completely overshadow the eyewitness testimony.

To get a more accurate estimate, we can use a simplified Bayesian approach:

1. **Start with the base rate:** There's a 15% (0.15) prior probability the attacker is male based purely on population.

2. **Incorporate the witness's accuracy:**
    * If the attacker *is* male, there's an 80% (0.8) chance the witness would correctly identify them as male.
    * If the attacker *is not* male (i.e., female), there's a 20% (0.2) chance the witness would incorrectly identify them as male.

3. **Calculate the adjusted probability:** We need to weigh the probabilities based on the witness's accuracy.  Without going into complex Bayesian formulas, we can estimate:

    * The probability of the witness being right AND the attacker being male is higher than the probability of the witness being wrong AND the attacker being male.

This means our final probability should be closer to the witness's accuracy (80%) than to the initial base rate (15%). A simplified estimate considering both pieces of evidence lands around **0.52 or 52%**.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation. A precise Bayesian calculation would provide a more accurate probability. However, the key takeaway is that both the eyewitness testimony and the base rate are important in forming an estimate.
