{probability: 0.62}

Here's how we can estimate the probability:

* **Prior Probability:** We start with the base rate in the population. There's a 15% chance the attacker is male based purely on the city's demographics.

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness has an 80% accuracy rate. This means:
    *  If the attacker *was* male, there's an 80% chance they'd correctly identify them.
    * If the attacker *wasn't* male (i.e., female), there's a 20% chance they'd incorrectly identify them as male.

* **Combining the Information:** We need to consider both the base rate and the witness's accuracy.  We can use a simplified Bayesian approach:

    1. **Scenario 1: Attacker is male** 
        * Probability of attacker being male: 0.15
        * Probability of witness being correct: 0.8
        * Combined probability for this scenario: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

    2. **Scenario 2: Attacker is female**
        * Probability of attacker being female: 0.85
        * Probability of witness being incorrect: 0.2
        * Combined probability for this scenario: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

    3. **Normalizing:** To get the probability of the attacker being male *given* the witness testimony, we divide the probability of scenario 1 by the sum of probabilities of both scenarios:

        Probability (attacker is male | witness said male) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.414 

    4. **Final Adjustment:** However, the witness identifying the attacker as male increases the probability from the initial 15% base rate.  We can approximate the final probability by taking a weighted average of the initial probability and the probability calculated above:

        Final Probability = 0.15 + (0.414 * (1 - 0.15)) = 0.62

**Therefore, the estimated probability of the attacker being male is approximately 0.62 or 62%.**

**Important Note:** This is a simplified calculation.  A more accurate Bayesian analysis would require considering factors like the reliability of the witness under stress, potential biases, and the confidence level of the witness's identification.
