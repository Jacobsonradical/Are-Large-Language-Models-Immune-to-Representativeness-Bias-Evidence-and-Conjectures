Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in identifying gender under similar conditions. This means their statement isn't definitive proof but provides strong evidence.
* **Population Demographics:** The city's population is predominantly female. This information is crucial as it provides the baseline probability before considering the witness testimony.

**Calculating the Probability**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine the witness's testimony with the prior probability based on population demographics:

Let:

*  "M" be the event that the attacker is male
*  "F" be the event that the attacker is female
*  "W" be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness said so.

Here's how Bayes' Theorem looks in this case:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|M):** The probability the witness would identify the attacker as male given the attacker is actually male. This is the witness's accuracy for identifying males, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(M):**  The prior probability of the attacker being male, based on the city's demographics, which is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W):** The probability the witness would identify the attacker as male (regardless of the attacker's actual gender).  This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
    * P(W|F) is the probability the witness would misidentify a female as male, which is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(F) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 85% or 0.85.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(W):**
   * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

2. **Calculate P(M|W):**
   * P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as male, considering the city's demographics where females are a significant majority, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.4%.
