Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in identifying gender under similar conditions. This means their testimony isn't foolproof.
* **Base Rate:** The city's population has a significantly higher percentage of females (85%) than males (15%). This base rate is crucial information.

**Reasoning**

We need to combine the witness's testimony with the base rate information.  It's tempting to say there's an 80% chance the attacker is male because of the witness. However, this ignores the fact that males are much rarer in the population.

**A Simplified Example**

Imagine a city of 100 people, 85 female and 15 male.  Let's say ALL of them were potential suspects that night. The witness would likely identify 80% of the males correctly (12 out of 15) as male. But they'd also misidentify 20% of the females (17 out of 85) as male. 

This means the witness would identify 29 people as male (12 correctly + 17 incorrectly), even though only 12 actually are.

**Calculation**

While a precise calculation is complex, we can estimate the probability by considering the following:

1. **Likelihood of a male attacker given the witness's identification:** The witness is more likely to identify a male attacker correctly than to misidentify a female attacker as male (since there are far fewer males). 

2. **Balancing with the base rate:**  However, the large difference in base rates (85% female vs. 15% male) significantly reduces the probability that the identified person is actually male.

**Estimate**

Considering these factors, the probability that the attacker is male is likely significantly lower than 80%. A more realistic estimate, while still uncertain, would be somewhere between **0.3 and 0.5**.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation. A more accurate calculation would require Bayesian reasoning, taking into account the witness's accuracy for both correct and incorrect identifications.
