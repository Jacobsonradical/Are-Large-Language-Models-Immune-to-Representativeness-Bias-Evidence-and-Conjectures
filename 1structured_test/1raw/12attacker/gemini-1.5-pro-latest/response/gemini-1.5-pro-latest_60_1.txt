**Explanation:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony and the city's demographics.

Let's define the following events:

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness said it was a male.**

Here's how we can break down the calculation:

* **P(W|M):** The probability the witness would identify the attacker as male if the attacker *is* male. This is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
* **P(M):** The prior probability of the attacker being male, based on the city's population. This is 0.15 (15%).
* **P(W|F):** The probability the witness would identify the attacker as male if the attacker *is* female. This is 0.2 (20% error rate).
* **P(F):** The prior probability of the attacker being female. This is 0.85 (85%).

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

To find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] + [P(W|F) * P(F)]
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.52

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony and the city's demographics, is approximately 0.52 or 52%.**
