Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let:**

* **M** be the event that the attacker is male.
* **F** be the event that the attacker is female.
* **W** be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

**We are given:**

* **P(F) = 0.85** (Prior probability of the attacker being female)
* **P(M) = 0.15** (Prior probability of the attacker being male)
* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (Probability the witness correctly identifies male, given the attacker is male)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies male, given the attacker is female)

**We want to find P(M|W):** The probability the attacker is male, given the witness identified them as male.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

To find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M)  +  P(W|F) * P(F) 
P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(M|W):**

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.4%.**
