**Explanation:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior belief (the population distribution) with the new evidence from the witness. 

* **Prior:** The probability of the attacker being male based purely on population demographics is 15% or 0.15.
* **Likelihood:** The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a male as male (and a 20% chance of misidentifying a female as male).
* **Evidence:** The witness stated the attacker was male.

**Calculation:**

Let "M" be the event that the attacker is male, and "W" be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. 

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness said so.

Bayes' Theorem states: P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(W|M) = 0.8 (likelihood of witness saying male given the attacker is male)
* P(M) = 0.15 (prior probability of attacker being male)
* P(W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] + [P(W|~M) * P(~M)]  (total probability of witness saying male, considering both possibilities of the attacker's true gender)

To calculate P(W), we also need:

* P(W|~M) = 0.2 (likelihood of witness saying male given the attacker is female)
* P(~M) = 0.85 (prior probability of attacker being female)

Now we can calculate:

* P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

Finally:

* P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.52 (approximately)

**Therefore, considering both the witness testimony and the city's gender demographics, the estimated probability of the attacker being male is approximately 52%.**
