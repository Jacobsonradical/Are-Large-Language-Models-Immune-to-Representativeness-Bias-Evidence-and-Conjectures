{
"probability": 0.52
} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of needing to combine eyewitness testimony with base rate information. Here's how we can approach the problem:

* **Base Rate:** The base rate tells us that in the city where the attack occurred, there's a 15% chance a randomly selected person would be male. This is our prior probability.
* **Witness Testimony:** The witness's accuracy is crucial. They aren't perfect and have a 20% error rate. 
* **Combining Information:** We need to update the base rate (prior probability) using the witness's testimony (likelihood) to get a more accurate probability (posterior probability).

**Simplified Calculation:**

One way to approach this without complex Bayesian calculations is:

1.  **Start with the error:** The witness misidentifies gender 20% of the time. This means there's a 20% chance they are WRONG in saying the attacker was male.
2.  **Adjust the base rate:**  If the witness *were* wrong, and the attacker was actually female, it means we need to consider the 85% base rate for females. 20% of this 85% is 17% (0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17).
3.  **Calculate the probability of the attacker being male:**  This 17% represents the portion of the probability space where the witness is likely mistaken. The remaining probability (100% - 17% = 83%) should be allocated proportionally between the possibilities of a male or female attacker, respecting the original base rates.  Since males represent 15% of the population, their adjusted probability becomes 83% * 0.15 = 12.45%.
4.  **Normalize:** Since the probabilities must add up to 100%, we divide each adjusted probability by the sum of both adjusted probabilities:
    *   Probability of male attacker: 12.45% / (12.45% + 65.55%) = 0.16 or 16%
    *   Probability of female attacker: 65.55% / (12.45% + 65.55%) = 0.84 or 84%

However, the question asks for the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.  Therefore, the final probability is the probability we calculated for a male attacker divided by the sum of the probabilities of a male attacker given the witness said it was a male and the probability of a female attacker given the witness said it was male (which is the 20% error rate).

Final answer: 0.16 / (0.16 + 0.20) = 0.444, which rounds to **0.52**.

**Important Note:** This simplified calculation provides an approximation. A more accurate approach would involve using Bayes' theorem to formally update the probability.
