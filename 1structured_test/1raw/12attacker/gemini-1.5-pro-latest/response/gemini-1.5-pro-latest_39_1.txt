Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the Events:**

* **M:** The attacker is male.
* **F:** The attacker is female.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. State the Given Probabilities:**

* **P(M) = 0.15** (Prior probability of the attacker being male)
* **P(F) = 0.85** (Prior probability of the attacker being female)
* **P(W|M) = 0.80** (Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is male)
* **P(W|F) = 0.20** (Likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is female)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(M|W)**, the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male. Bayes' Theorem states:

```
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W) 
```

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:

```
P(W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] + [P(W|F) * P(F)]
```

**4. Calculate:**

* **P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**
* **P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.4%.**
