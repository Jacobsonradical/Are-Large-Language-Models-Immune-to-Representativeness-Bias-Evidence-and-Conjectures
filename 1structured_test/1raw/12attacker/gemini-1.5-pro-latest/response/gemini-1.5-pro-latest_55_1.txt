Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in determining gender under similar conditions. This means they are more likely to be right than wrong, but there's still a chance of error.
* **Base Rate:** The city's population has a significantly higher percentage of females (85%) than males (15%). This base rate is crucial information.

**It's Not Simply 80%**

Many people would mistakenly assume the probability of the attacker being male is 80% based on the witness testimony alone. However, this ignores the base rate.  The high percentage of females in the population makes it statistically more likely that the attacker is female, even with the witness testimony.

**Calculating a More Accurate Probability (Using Bayes' Theorem)**

Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update our prior belief (the base rate) with new evidence (witness testimony) to arrive at a more accurate posterior belief (the probability of the attacker being male given the evidence).

However, performing a full Bayesian calculation here would require additional assumptions about the witness's bias towards identifying genders (e.g., are they equally likely to mistake a female for a male as they are to mistake a male for a female?).  

**A Simplified Approach**

Given the lack of information about the witness's biases, we can make a simplified estimation:

1. **Consider both pieces of evidence:**  The witness leans towards male (80%), but the population leans heavily towards female (85%).
2. **The probability is likely somewhere between these two values.** Given the strong base rate of females in the population, the final probability will be pulled closer to the 15% mark. 

**Estimate:**

It's difficult to give a precise number without a full Bayesian analysis. However, considering the information, a reasonable estimate would be:

```json
{
"probability": 0.3 
}
```

**Important Note:** This is an approximation. A more accurate calculation would require additional information and a Bayesian analysis.
