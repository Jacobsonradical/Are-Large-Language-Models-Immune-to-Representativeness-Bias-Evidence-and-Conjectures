Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the Events:**

*  Let "M" be the event that the attacker is male.
*  Let "W" be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

**2. State the Given Probabilities:**

* **Prior Probability:** P(M) = 0.15 (The proportion of males in the city)
* **Witness Reliability:** 
    * P(W|M) = 0.80 (The probability the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
    * P(~W|M) = 0.20 (The probability the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female)
    * P(W|~M) = 0.20 (The probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
    * P(~W|~M) = 0.80 (The probability the witness correctly identifies a female as female)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(M|W), the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

To find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] + [P(W|~M) * P(~M)] 
P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate the Posterior Probability:**

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.38%.**
