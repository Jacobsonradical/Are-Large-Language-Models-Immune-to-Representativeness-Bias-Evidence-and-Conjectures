Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness is 80% accurate in identifying gender under similar conditions. This means their testimony isn't perfect.
* **Base Rate:** The city's population has a significantly higher percentage of females (85%) than males (15%). This base rate is crucial information.

**Reasoning**

We need to combine the witness testimony with the base rate.  It's tempting to say there's an 80% chance the attacker is male because of the witness. However, this ignores the fact that males are much less common in the city.

**A Simplified Approach (Not Perfectly Accurate, but Illustrative)**

Imagine 100 similar attacks happened in this city.

* Due to the base rates, we'd expect around 15 attacks (15% of 100) to have been committed by males and 85 by females.
* Out of the 15 attacks by males, the witness would likely correctly identify around 12 (80% of 15).
* Out of the 85 attacks by females, the witness would likely misidentify around 17 (20% of 85) as being committed by males.

This rough illustration shows that the witness would identify more females as male (due to the high base rate) than they would correctly identify actual males.

**A More Formal Approach (Bayes' Theorem)**

Bayes' Theorem provides a way to calculate this probability accurately. However, given the complexity, it's not feasible to calculate a precise number without additional information about conditional probabilities. 

**Conclusion**

While we cannot calculate a precise probability without more information, it is crucial to understand that:

* The probability of the attacker being male is significantly lower than 80% due to the high base rate of females in the population. 
* The witness's testimony, while important, needs to be weighed against the background prevalence of males and females in the city.

**Answer:**

Given the information, it would be misleading to provide a specific number. We can say with confidence that the probability the attacker is male is **significantly lower than 0.8 (80%)** but providing a more precise estimate requires a Bayesian analysis with more detailed information.
