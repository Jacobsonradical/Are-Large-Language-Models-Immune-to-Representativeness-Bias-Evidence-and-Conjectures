Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**1. Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from "a"):** Before considering the witness, the probability of a randomly chosen person in the city being male is 15% or 0.15. This is our starting point.
* **Witness Reliability (from "b"):** The witness is not perfect. They have an 80% chance of correctly identifying gender in similar conditions.

**2.  Bayes' Theorem**

To combine this information and update our belief, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. It's perfect for situations where we have prior knowledge and get new evidence. 

**Let's define some events:**

*  **M:** The attacker is male.
*  **F:** The attacker is female.
*  **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)

Where:

* P(M|W): The probability the attacker is male *given* the witness said so (this is what we want).
* P(W|M): The probability the witness would say "male" *if* the attacker is actually male (this is 80% or 0.8).
* P(M): The prior probability of the attacker being male (this is 15% or 0.15).
* P(W): The probability of the witness saying "male" (we'll calculate this below).

**3. Calculating P(W)**

To find P(W), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** The attacker is male, and the witness is right (P(W|M) * P(M) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12)
* **Scenario 2:** The attacker is female, and the witness is wrong (P(W|F) * P(F) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)

P(W) is the sum of these scenarios: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Final Calculation**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}

**Conclusion:**

After considering the witness testimony, the probability that the attacker is male has increased from 15% to approximately 41.38%.
