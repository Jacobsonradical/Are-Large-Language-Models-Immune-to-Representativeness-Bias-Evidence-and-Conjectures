"probability": 0.52

**Explanation:**

While it might seem intuitive to heavily weight the population percentages (giving a higher likelihood of a female attacker), the witness testimony significantly outweighs that factor. Here's why:

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness has a demonstrated 80% accuracy in identifying gender under similar conditions. This makes their testimony a much stronger indicator than the general population statistics.
* **Combining Probabilities:** To get a more accurate estimate, we need to consider both pieces of information. A simplified way to approach this is:
    1. **Start with the base rate:** Assume the witness had no information, then the probability of a male attacker would be 15% (based on population).
    2. **Factor in witness accuracy:**  Since the witness is 80% accurate, they are 4 times more likely to be right than wrong (80% / 20% = 4).
    3. **Adjust the probability:** Increase the initial 15% likelihood by a factor of 4, giving us 60%.
    4. **Normalize:** Since the probabilities of male and female attackers must add up to 100%, divide the adjusted probability (60%) by the sum of the adjusted probability and its complement (60% + 40% = 100%). This gives us 60% / 100% = 0.6.

* **Final Adjustment:** A more rigorous Bayesian approach would yield a slightly lower probability than 0.6, taking into account the possibility of the witness being wrong even with their 80% accuracy. Therefore, we estimate the probability to be slightly lower at **0.52**.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation. A precise calculation would require applying Bayes' theorem, which is a more complex statistical method.
