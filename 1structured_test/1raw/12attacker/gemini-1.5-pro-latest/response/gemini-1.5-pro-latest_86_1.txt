Here's how to approach this problem, which combines base rates (the city's gender distribution) and witness reliability:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Base Rate:** The city's population has a high percentage of females (85%) and a low percentage of males (15%). This is our starting point.
* **Witness Testimony:** The witness isn't perfect. While they tend to identify gender correctly, they are wrong 20% of the time. 

**Calculations**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to combine this information. Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our beliefs given new evidence. Here's a simplified way to think about it in this case:

1. **Scenarios:**  Let's imagine 100 attacks happened. Based on the city's demographics:
   *  We'd expect around 15 attacks to be by males.
   *  We'd expect around 85 attacks to be by females.

2. **Witness Accuracy:** The witness is right 80% of the time. Of the 15 attacks by males:
    *  They'd correctly identify about 12 (80% of 15).
    *  They'd misidentify about 3 (20% of 15).

3. **False Positives:**  Similarly, of the 85 attacks by females:
    *  They'd misidentify about 17 (20% of 85) as male. 

4. **Total "Male" Identifications:**  The witness would identify about 29 attacks as being by males (12 correct + 17 incorrect).

5. **Probability:** Out of those 29, only 12 were actually by males. The probability the attacker was male given the witness's identification is approximately 12/29.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation. Bayes' Theorem provides a more formal way to calculate this, but the logic remains the same.
