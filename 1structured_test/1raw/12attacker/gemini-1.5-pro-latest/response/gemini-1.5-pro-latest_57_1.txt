Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to update our prior belief (the population distribution of males and females) with the new evidence provided by the witness. 

**Let's break it down:**

* **Prior:** The probability of a randomly chosen person in the city being male is 15% (0.15). This is our starting point.
* **Likelihood:** The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying genders. This means:
    * If the attacker *is* male, there's an 80% chance the witness would correctly identify them as male.
    * If the attacker *is not* male (i.e., female), there's a 20% chance the witness would incorrectly identify them as male.
* **Posterior:**  What we want to calculate - the probability the attacker is male given the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem (simplified form)**

Since we're dealing with a binary outcome (male or not male), we can use a simplified form of Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) 
```

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of the attacker being male (A) given the witness said male (B) - what we want to find.
* P(B|A) = Probability of the witness saying male (B) given the attacker is male (A) = 0.8 (80%)
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being male = 0.15 (15%)
* P(B) = Overall probability of the witness saying "male" (This can happen in two ways: attacker is male and correctly identified, or attacker is female and incorrectly identified).

To calculate P(B):

* P(B) =  P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B|~A) * P(~A) 
* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we have all the pieces:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4138}

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's demographics, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.38%.**
