Here's how to approach this problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witness isn't perfect. They have an 80% chance of correctly identifying gender in similar conditions.
* **Base Rates:** The city's population has a significantly higher percentage of females (85%) than males (15%).

**Reasoning**

We need to combine the witness's accuracy with the city's demographics.  It's tempting to say there's an 80% chance the attacker is male because of the witness. However, the high percentage of females in the population makes it more likely the witness saw a female and misidentified her as male.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best tackled using Bayes' Theorem, which helps calculate conditional probabilities:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B):  Probability of event A happening given that event B happened. 
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening given that event A happened.
* P(A): Probability of event A happening.
* P(B): Probability of event B happening.

**Let's apply this to our problem:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is male.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B): The probability the attacker is male *given* the witness said it was male.

Here's how to break down the calculation:

* **P(B|A):**  If the attacker *is* male, the probability of the witness correctly identifying them as male is 0.8 (80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness saying "male" can happen in two ways:
    * The attacker is male, and the witness is correct (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12)
    * The attacker is female, and the witness is incorrect (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17) 
    * Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}

**Conclusion:**

Despite the witness identifying the attacker as male, there's only approximately a 41.38% probability the attacker actually is male. The high proportion of females in the population significantly influences this probability.
