**Explanation:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior belief about the attacker's gender (based on population demographics) with the new evidence from the witness testimony.

* **Prior probability (P(Male))**:  The initial probability of the attacker being male is based on the city's demographics, which is 15% or 0.15.

* **Likelihood (P(Witness Correct | Male))**: This is the probability that the witness would correctly identify the attacker as male, given the attacker is actually male. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

* **Likelihood (P(Witness Correct | Female))**: This is the probability that the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as male, given the attacker is actually female. This is 20% or 0.2.

* **Prior probability (P(Female))**: The initial probability of the attacker being female, based on demographics, is 85% or 0.85.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Male | Witness Correct) = [P(Witness Correct | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness Correct)

To calculate P(Witness Correct), we use the law of total probability:

P(Witness Correct) =  [P(Witness Correct | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness Correct | Female) * P(Female)]
P(Witness Correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Male | Witness Correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

However, the question asks for the probability of the attacker being male given the witness *identified* them as male, not necessarily *correctly* identified.  Since the witness has a 20% error rate, there's a chance they misidentified a female attacker as male.

Therefore, the final adjusted probability is a weighted average:

Final Probability (Male) = 0.8 (Probability of correct identification) * 0.414 + 0.2 (Probability of misidentification) * 0.85 =  0.52
