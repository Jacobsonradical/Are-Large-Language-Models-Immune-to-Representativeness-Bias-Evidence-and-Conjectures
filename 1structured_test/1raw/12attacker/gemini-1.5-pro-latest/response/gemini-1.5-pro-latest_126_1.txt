"probability": 0.52

**Explanation:**

We can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief (the population distribution) with the new evidence (witness testimony).

* **Prior Probability (P(Male))**: This is the probability of the attacker being male based solely on the city's population. So, P(Male) = 0.15.

* **Likelihood (P(Witness Correct | Male))**: This is the probability that the witness would correctly identify the attacker as male *given* the attacker is actually male. This is given as 80%, or P(Witness Correct | Male) = 0.8.

* **Likelihood (P(Witness Correct | Female))**:  This is the probability the witness would identify the attacker as male *given* the attacker is actually female (meaning they'd be wrong). This would be 20%, or P(Witness Correct | Female) = 0.2.

* **Posterior Probability (P(Male | Witness Correct))**: This is what we want to calculate - the probability the attacker is male *given* the witness identified them as male.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Male | Witness Correct) = [P(Witness Correct | Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness Correct)

To calculate P(Witness Correct), we use the law of total probability:

P(Witness Correct) = [P(Witness Correct | Male) * P(Male)] + [P(Witness Correct | Female) * P(Female)]
P(Witness Correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Male | Witness Correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.52

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness testimony and the city's demographics, is 0.52 or 52%.**
