Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** The information about the city's population (85% female, 15% male) gives us the *prior probability* of the attacker being male. This is the baseline chance before considering the witness testimony.
* **Witness Reliability:** The witness's accuracy (80%) is crucial. However, it doesn't directly translate to an 80% chance that the attacker is male. We need to factor in the possibility that the witness might have misidentified a female attacker as male.
* **Bayes' Theorem:** This problem is best tackled using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update prior probabilities with new evidence.

**Let's break it down:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is male.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as male.

* **We want to find:** P(A|B) - The probability the attacker is male *given* that the witness said so.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(B|A) = Probability the witness would identify the attacker as male *if* the attacker is actually male (this is the witness's accuracy of 80%).
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being male (15% or 0.15).
* P(B) = Overall probability the witness would identify the attacker as male (this needs to be calculated).

**Calculating P(B):**

There are two ways the witness could identify the attacker as male:

1. **The attacker is male, and the witness is correct:** P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
2. **The attacker is female, and the witness is incorrect:** P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as male, there's only approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker is actually male. The relatively high percentage of females in the city significantly influences the final probability.
