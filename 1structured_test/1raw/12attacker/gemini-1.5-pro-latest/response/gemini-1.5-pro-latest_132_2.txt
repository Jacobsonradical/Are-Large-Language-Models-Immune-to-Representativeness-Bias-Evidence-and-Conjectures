Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being male is simply the percentage of males in the city's population. 
* This is given in statement "a" as 15%.

**2. Likelihood:**

* Statement "b" provides information about the witness's reliability. This is not the probability of the attacker being male, but rather the probability of the witness saying "male" *given* the attacker's true gender.
* We are interested in the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker: 80%.

**3. Combining Prior and Likelihood (Bayesian Reasoning):**

We need a way to combine the prior probability with the witness testimony.  Bayes' Theorem provides a framework, but a simplified approach is sufficient for this problem:

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is Male** 
    * Probability of this scenario: 15% (prior)
    * Probability of witness correctly saying "male" in this scenario: 80% 
* **Scenario 2: Attacker is Female**
    * Probability of this scenario: 85% (prior)
    * Probability of witness incorrectly saying "male" in this scenario: 20% 

To get an estimate, we can weight the probabilities:

* Weighted probability of attacker being male AND witness being correct: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
* Weighted probability of attacker being female AND witness being incorrect: 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

**4. Normalizing to get the Posterior Probability:**

* The two weighted probabilities above represent the relative likelihood of each scenario. 
* To get the probability of the attacker being male *given* the witness testimony, we normalize these:
    * Total weighted probability: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
    * Probability (attacker is male | witness said male) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation.  A more formal Bayesian approach would involve calculating the likelihood of the evidence (witness saying "male") under both hypotheses (attacker is male, attacker is female) and updating the prior belief accordingly. However, the logic and the result would be similar.
