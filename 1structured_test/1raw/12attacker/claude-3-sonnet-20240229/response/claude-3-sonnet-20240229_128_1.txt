To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time, where A' is the event that the attacker is female)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137931...

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is:

{probability: 0.4137931}
