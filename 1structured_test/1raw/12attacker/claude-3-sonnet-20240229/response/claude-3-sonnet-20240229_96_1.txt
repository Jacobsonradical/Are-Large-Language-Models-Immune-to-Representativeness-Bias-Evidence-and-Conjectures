To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) × P(M)) / P(W)

Given:
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)

We need to calculate P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, regardless of the actual gender.

P(W) = P(W|M) × P(M) + P(W|¬M) × P(¬M)
     = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population statistics is:

{probability: 0.414}
