To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem and combine the given information about the population gender distribution and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender.

Let's define the following events:
- M: The attacker is male
- F: The attacker is female
- E: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|E), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|E) = (P(E|M) * P(M)) / (P(E|M) * P(M) + P(E|F) * P(F))

Given information:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(E|M) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(E|F) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(M|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(M|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|E) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified them as male, is approximately 0.414.
