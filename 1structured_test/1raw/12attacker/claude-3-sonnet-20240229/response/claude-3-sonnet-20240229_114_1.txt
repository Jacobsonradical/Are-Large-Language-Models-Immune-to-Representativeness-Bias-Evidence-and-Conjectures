To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. In this case, we need to find the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics.

Let's define the events:
- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) × P(M)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|M) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male (80% or 0.8 from the information provided)
- P(M) is the prior probability that the attacker is male (15% or 0.15 from the population statistics)
- P(W) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which we need to calculate using the law of total probability

P(W) = P(W|M) × P(M) + P(W|~M) × P(~M)
     = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 (assuming the witness has a 20% chance of misidentifying a female as male)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can substitute the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
