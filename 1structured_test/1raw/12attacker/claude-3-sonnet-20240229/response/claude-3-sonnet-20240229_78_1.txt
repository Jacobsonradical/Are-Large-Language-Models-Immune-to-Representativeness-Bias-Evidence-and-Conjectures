To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the prior probability based on the new evidence (the witness's identification).

Given information:
- Prior probability of the attacker being male = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male)
- Prior probability of the attacker being female = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female)
- Sensitivity (probability of correctly identifying a male as male) = 0.8
- False positive rate (probability of incorrectly identifying a female as male) = 0.2

Let's denote the event that the attacker is male as M, and the event that the witness identified the attacker as male as I.

We want to find P(M|I), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|I) = (P(I|M) * P(M)) / P(I)

P(I|M) is the sensitivity, which is 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a male as male).
P(M) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15.
P(I) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be calculated as:
P(I) = P(I|M) * P(M) + P(I|~M) * P(~M)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(M|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
