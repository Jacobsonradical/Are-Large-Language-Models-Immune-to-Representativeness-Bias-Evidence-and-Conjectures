To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the events:

- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) × P(M)) / P(W)

Given information:
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W) = P(W|M) × P(M) + P(W|¬M) × P(¬M), where ¬M represents "not male" (female)

We don't have the value of P(W|¬M), but we can calculate it using the given information:
P(W|¬M) = 1 - P(correct identification|¬M) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Substituting the values, we get:
P(W) = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(M|W):
P(M|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.414}
