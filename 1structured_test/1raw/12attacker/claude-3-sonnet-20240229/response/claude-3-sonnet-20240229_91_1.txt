To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population statistics.

Let's define the following events:
- M: The attacker is male
- F: The attacker is female
- I: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|I), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|I) = (P(I|M) * P(M)) / (P(I|M) * P(M) + P(I|F) * P(F))

Given information:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(I|M) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(I|F) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(M|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately 0.414.
