To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the following events:

- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) × P(M)) / P(W)

Given information:
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W) = P(W|M) × P(M) + P(W|~M) × P(~M), where ~M represents the event that the attacker is not male (female).

We don't know P(W|~M), but we can calculate it using the information that the witness errs 20% of the time:
P(W|~M) = 0.2

Substituting the values, we get:
P(W) = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(M|W):
P(M|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.414}
