To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events and allows us to update the probability based on new evidence.

Given:
- The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time (accuracy rate).
- The witness identified the attacker as male.
- 15% of the population in the city is male (prior probability of the attacker being male).

Let's define the events:
- M: The attacker is male.
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|M) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male (accuracy rate = 0.8).
- P(M) is the prior probability that the attacker is male (0.15).
- P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
  P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)
  = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
  = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
        = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
