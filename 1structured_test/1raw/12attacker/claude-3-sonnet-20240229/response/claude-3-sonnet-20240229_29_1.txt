To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(¬B|¬A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a female 80% of the time)

We need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's actual gender.

P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|¬A) × P(¬A)
     = 0.8 × 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) × 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
