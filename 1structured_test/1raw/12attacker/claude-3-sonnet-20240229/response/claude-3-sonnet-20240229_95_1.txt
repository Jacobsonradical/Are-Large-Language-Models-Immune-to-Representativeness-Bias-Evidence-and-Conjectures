To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events based on the given information.

Let's define the events:
- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / P(W)

Given information:
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|¬M) * P(¬M)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29

Substituting the values:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
