To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(B|A^c) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.414}
