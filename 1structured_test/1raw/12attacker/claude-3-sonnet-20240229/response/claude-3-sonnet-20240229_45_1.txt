To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the events:
- M: The attacker is male
- F: The attacker is female
- E: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|E), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|E) = (P(E|M) * P(M)) / (P(E|M) * P(M) + P(E|F) * P(F))

Given information:
- P(E|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(E|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Substituting the values:
P(M|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(M|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
