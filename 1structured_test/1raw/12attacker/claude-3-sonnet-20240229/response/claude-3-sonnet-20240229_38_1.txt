To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events, given certain evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
  = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85
  = 0.12 + 0.17
  = 0.29

Substituting the values into Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
        = 0.12 / 0.29
        = 0.4137931

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4137931}
