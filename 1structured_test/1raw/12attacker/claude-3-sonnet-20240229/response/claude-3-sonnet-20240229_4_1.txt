To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events to their prior probabilities.

Given:
- P(M) = 0.15 (Prior probability that the attacker is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (Prior probability that the attacker is female)
- P(E|M) = 0.8 (Probability of witness correctly identifying a male)
- P(E|F) = 0.2 (Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

We want to find P(M|E), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

By Bayes' theorem:
P(M|E) = (P(E|M) × P(M)) / (P(E|M) × P(M) + P(E|F) × P(F))

Substituting the given values:
P(M|E) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
P(M|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|E) ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.414}
