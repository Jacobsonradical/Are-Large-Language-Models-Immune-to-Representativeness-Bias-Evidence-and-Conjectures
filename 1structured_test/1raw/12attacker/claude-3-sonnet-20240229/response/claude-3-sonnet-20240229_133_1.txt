To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as male with an accuracy of 80%.
- 15% of the population in the city is male, and 85% is female.

Let's define the events:
- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) × P(M)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|M) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
- P(M) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(W) is the overall probability that the witness identified the attacker as male, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
  P(W) = P(W|M) × P(M) + P(W|¬M) × P(¬M)
       = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 (assuming the witness has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying a female as male)
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
