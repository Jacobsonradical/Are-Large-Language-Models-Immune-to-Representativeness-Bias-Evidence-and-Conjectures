To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(B|A^c) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, where A^c is the event that the attacker is female)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
