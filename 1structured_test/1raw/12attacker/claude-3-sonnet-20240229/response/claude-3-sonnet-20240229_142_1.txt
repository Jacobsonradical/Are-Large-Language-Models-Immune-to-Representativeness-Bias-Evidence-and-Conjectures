To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let:
- M be the event that the attacker is male
- W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / P(W)

Given information:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(W|¬M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|¬M) * P(¬M)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.27

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27
       = 0.444...

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified them as male, is:

{probability: 0.444}
