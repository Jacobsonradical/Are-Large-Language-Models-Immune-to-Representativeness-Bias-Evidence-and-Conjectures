To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / P(W)

Given:
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)
        = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
        = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
