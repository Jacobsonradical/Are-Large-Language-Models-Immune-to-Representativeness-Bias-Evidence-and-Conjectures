To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male, based on the population distribution)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, where A' is the complement of A)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4137931...

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, is:

{probability: 0.4137931}
