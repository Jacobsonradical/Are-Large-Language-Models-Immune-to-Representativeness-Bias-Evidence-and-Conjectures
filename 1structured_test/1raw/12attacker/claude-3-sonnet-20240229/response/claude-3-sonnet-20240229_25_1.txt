To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(¬B|¬A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies females 80% of the time, where ¬A represents "not male")

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can substitute the values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified them as male, is approximately 0.4138.
