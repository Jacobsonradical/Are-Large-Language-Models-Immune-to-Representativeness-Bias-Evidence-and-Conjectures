To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events and allows us to revise the initial probability based on additional evidence.

Given:
- P(correct identification | male) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(incorrect identification | female) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies females 20% of the time)
- P(male) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being male based on the population)
- P(female) = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being female based on the population)

We want to find P(male | correct identification), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(male | correct identification) = (P(correct identification | male) × P(male)) / (P(correct identification | male) × P(male) + P(incorrect identification | female) × P(female))

Substituting the given values:
P(male | correct identification) = (0.8 × 0.15) / ((0.8 × 0.15) + (0.2 × 0.85))
P(male | correct identification) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(male | correct identification) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(male | correct identification) ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
