To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(female) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(male) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(witness correctly identifies male | male) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(witness incorrectly identifies male | female) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) = P(witness correctly identifies male | male) = 0.8
P(A) = P(male) = 0.15
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.27

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27 = 0.444444...

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.444444}
