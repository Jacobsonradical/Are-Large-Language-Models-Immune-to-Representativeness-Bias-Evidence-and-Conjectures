To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which combines the prior probability (based on the population statistics) with the likelihood ratio (based on the witness's ability to identify gender correctly).

Given information:
- Prior probability that a person is male = 0.15 (based on population statistics)
- Prior probability that a person is female = 0.85 (based on population statistics)
- Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male = 0.8
- Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male = 0.2

Let's denote the event that the attacker is male as M, and the event that the witness identified the attacker as male as W.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / P(W)

P(W|M) = Probability of the witness identifying a male as male = 0.8
P(M) = Prior probability that the attacker is male = 0.15

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.4138}
