To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events and allows us to update the probability of an event based on new information.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(¬B|¬A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies females 80% of the time, where ¬A represents "not male", i.e., female)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's actual gender.
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85 (since P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(¬B|¬A))
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified them as male, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
