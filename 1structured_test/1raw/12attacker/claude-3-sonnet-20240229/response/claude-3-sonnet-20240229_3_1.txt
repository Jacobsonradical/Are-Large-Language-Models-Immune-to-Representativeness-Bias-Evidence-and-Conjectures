To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|M) is the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker as male, which is given as 0.8 (80%).
- P(M) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is given as 0.15 (15%).
- P(W) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's true gender.

To find P(W), we need to consider both cases: when the attacker is male and when the attacker is female.
P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (assuming the witness has a 20% error rate for identifying females as males)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately 0.414.
