To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as male with an accuracy of 80%.
- The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (80% accuracy).

P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).

P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|A') × P(A')
     = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 (assuming the witness errs 20% of the time for females)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.414}
