To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability based on the available evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- M: The attacker is male
- F: The attacker is female
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) × P(M)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|M) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 according to the information provided.
- P(M) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 according to the population statistics.
- P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's actual gender.

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) × P(M) + P(W|F) × P(F)

Where:
- P(W|F) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 0.2 (since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time).
- P(F) is the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85 according to the population statistics.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(W) = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(M|W):

P(M|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.41}
