To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|M) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. From the given information, this is 0.8.
- P(M) is the prior probability that the attacker is male. From the given information, this is 0.15.
- P(W) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, which we need to calculate.

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + P(W|~M) * 0.85

We don't know P(W|~M), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male (female). However, we can use the information that the witness errs 20% of the time, so P(W|~M) = 0.2.

Substituting the values, we get:
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(M|W):
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
