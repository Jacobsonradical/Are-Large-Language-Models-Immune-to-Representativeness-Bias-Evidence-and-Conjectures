To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the following events:

- M: The attacker is male
- F: The attacker is female
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Given information:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (Witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (Witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4285 or 42.85%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4285 or 42.85%.
