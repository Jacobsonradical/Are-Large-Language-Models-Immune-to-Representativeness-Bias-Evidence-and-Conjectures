To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Given information:
- Prior probability of a person being male in the city: P(Male) = 0.15
- Prior probability of a person being female in the city: P(Female) = 0.85
- Probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male: P(Identified as male | Male) = 0.8
- Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male: P(Identified as male | Female) = 0.2

We want to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male, P(Male | Identified as male).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(Male | Identified as male) = (P(Identified as male | Male) × P(Male)) / (P(Identified as male | Male) × P(Male) + P(Identified as male | Female) × P(Female))

Substituting the values:
P(Male | Identified as male) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
P(Male | Identified as male) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(Male | Identified as male) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(Male | Identified as male) ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the provided information, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
