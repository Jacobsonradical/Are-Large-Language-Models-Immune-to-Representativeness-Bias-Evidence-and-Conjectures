To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(witness correct | male) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(witness incorrect | male) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female 20% of the time)
- P(male) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male, given that 15% of the population is male)

We want to calculate P(male | witness correct), which is the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(male | witness correct) = (P(witness correct | male) × P(male)) / P(witness correct)

To find P(witness correct), we need to consider both cases: when the attacker is male and when the attacker is female.
P(witness correct) = P(witness correct | male) × P(male) + P(witness correct | female) × P(female)
P(witness correct) = 0.8 × 0.15 + (1 - 0.2) × 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(male | witness correct) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.1875

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.1875}
