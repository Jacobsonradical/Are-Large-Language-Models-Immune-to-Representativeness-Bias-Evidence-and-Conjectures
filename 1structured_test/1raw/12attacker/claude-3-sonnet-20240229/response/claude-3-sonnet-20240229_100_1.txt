To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- The witness identified the attacker as male.
- The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time for males and 80% of the time for females.
- The population is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's define the following events:
- M: The attacker is male.
- F: The attacker is female.
- E: The witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(M|E), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|E) = [P(E|M) * P(M)] / [P(E|M) * P(M) + P(E|F) * P(F)]

P(E|M) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(M) = 0.15 (The prior probability that the attacker is male, given by the population statistics)
P(E|F) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
P(F) = 0.85 (The prior probability that the attacker is female, given by the population statistics)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(M|E) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)]
       = [0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)]
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.414}
