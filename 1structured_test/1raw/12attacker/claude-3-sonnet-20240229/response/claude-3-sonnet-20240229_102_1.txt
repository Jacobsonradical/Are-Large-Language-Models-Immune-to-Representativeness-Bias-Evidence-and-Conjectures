To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male. From the information given, this is 0.8.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is male. From the information given, this is 0.15 (15% of the population is male).
- P(B) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which we can calculate using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'), where A' is the event that the attacker is not male (female).

Substituting the known values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.27

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27 = 0.444...

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.444}
