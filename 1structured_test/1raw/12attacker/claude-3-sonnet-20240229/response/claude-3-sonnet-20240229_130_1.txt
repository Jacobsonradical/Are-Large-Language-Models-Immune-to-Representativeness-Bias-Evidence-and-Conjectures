To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events and provides a way to update or revise beliefs in light of new evidence.

Given:
- The witness identified the attacker as male.
- The witness's accuracy rate in identifying gender is 80%.
- The population in the city consists of 85% females and 15% males.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male. This is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population statistics.
- P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's actual gender.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the two possible cases:
1. The attacker is male, and the witness correctly identifies them as male: P(B|A) × P(A) = 0.8 × 0.15 = 0.12
2. The attacker is female, and the witness incorrectly identifies them as male: P(B|¬A) × P(¬A) = 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.17

P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|¬A) × P(¬A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
