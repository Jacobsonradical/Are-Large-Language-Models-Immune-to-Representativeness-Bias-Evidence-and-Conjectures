To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events and allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|M) is the probability of the witness identifying a male as male, which is given as 0.8.
- P(M) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is given as 0.15.
- P(W) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as male, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
  P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
       = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
