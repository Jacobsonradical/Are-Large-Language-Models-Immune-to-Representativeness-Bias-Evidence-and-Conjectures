To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events and allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(W|M) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male. This is given as 0.8.
- P(M) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 according to the population statistics.
- P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's actual gender. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
  P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
       = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
