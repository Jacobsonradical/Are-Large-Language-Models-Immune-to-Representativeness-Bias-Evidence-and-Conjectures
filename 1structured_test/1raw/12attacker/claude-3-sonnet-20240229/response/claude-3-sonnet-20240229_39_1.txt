To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events given certain evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male (0.8 from the given information)
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is male (0.15 from the population information)
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's actual gender

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Where:
- P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male (0.2 from the given information)
- P(~A) is the prior probability that the attacker is female (0.85 from the population information)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.414}
