To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events and allows us to update the prior probability based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / P(W)

Given:
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (Prior probability that the attacker is male, given the population distribution)
- P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|¬M) * P(¬M)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
         = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.414}
