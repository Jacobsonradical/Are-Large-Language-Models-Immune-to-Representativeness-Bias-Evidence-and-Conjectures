To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
  - P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
  - P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is female)
  - P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is:

{probability: 0.414}
