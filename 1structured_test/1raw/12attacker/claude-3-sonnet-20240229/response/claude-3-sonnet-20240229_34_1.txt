To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / P(W)

Given:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(W|~M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time)

We can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.414}
