To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events are A (attacker is male) and W (witness identifies the attacker as male).

Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% or 15 out of 100)
P(W|A) = 1 (since if the attacker is male and the witness identifies him as male, this is certain)

We need to find P(W), which can be computed as the sum of probabilities for each gender of the witnessed event:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
      = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
      = 0.15 + 0.17
      = 0.32

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
      = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32

Answer: {probability: 0.46875}
