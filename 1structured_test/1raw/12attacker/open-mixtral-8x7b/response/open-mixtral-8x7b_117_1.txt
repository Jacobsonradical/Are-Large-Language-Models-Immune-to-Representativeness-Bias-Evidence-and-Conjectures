To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem statement, we know that P(B|A) is the accuracy of the witness identifying a male as male, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is not given directly but can be inferred from the fact that 15% of the city's population is male. If we assume that the attacker is randomly chosen from the city's population, then P(A) = 0.15.

Calculating P(B) is a bit more complex because it includes two possibilities: the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (P(B|A) * P(A)) and the witness mistakenly identifying a female attacker as male (P(B|A') * P(A')). Here, A' denotes the complementary event of A, i.e., the attacker is female.

Given that P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A') = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate for identifying females), and P(A') = 0.85 (the proportion of females in the city), we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Finally, we can estimate P(A|B) as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.343.
