To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the two events are A (the attacker is male) and B (a witness identified the attacker as male).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
1. P(A): Probability of the attacker being male = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is male)
2. P(B|A): Probability of the witness identifying the male attacker correctly = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male regardless of the attacker's gender. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345 (34.5%)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.345}
