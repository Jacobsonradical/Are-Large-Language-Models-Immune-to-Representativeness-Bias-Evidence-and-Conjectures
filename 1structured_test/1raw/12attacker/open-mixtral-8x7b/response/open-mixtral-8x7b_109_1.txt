Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male. This tells us that if we randomly select a person from the city, there's a 15% chance they'll be male.
2. However, we also have testimony from a witness who identified the attacker as male. The court assessed this witness and found they correctly identify gender 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to combine these two pieces of information.

Let's calculate the probability:

The probability that the attacker is male, given the evidence, is the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies males. This is equal to the product of the probability that the attacker is male (15%) and the probability that the witness correctly identifies males (80%).

Similarly, the probability that the attacker is male but the witness identifies them as female is the product of the probability that the attacker is male (15%) and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies males (20%).

The total probability that the attacker is male is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(Attacker is male) = P(Attacker is male and Witness correctly identifies males) + P(Attacker is male and Witness incorrectly identifies males)
= (0.15)*(0.80) + (0.15)*(0.20)
= 0.18 + 0.03
= 0.21

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.21}
