To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is male.
B: A witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that when the witness is not sure about the gender, they correctly identify males 80% of the time and err 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we have P(B|A) = 0.8.

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is male, so P(A) = 0.15.

Calculating P(B) is a bit tricky because it depends on the total population. Ideally, we would want to know the probability of a random person being identified as male by the witness, which is given by P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). However, we are only given P(B|A) and P(A), but not P(B|not A) and P(not A).

We can approximate P(B) using the law of total probability as follows: P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(A) * P(B|A) + (1-P(A)) * P(B|not A).

We know P(A) and P(B|A), but we don't know P(B|not A) or P(not A). However, since the witness has a 20% error rate, we can estimate that P(B|not A) = 0.2. Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + (1-P(A)) * P(B|not A) = 0.15 * 0.8 + (1-0.15) * 0.2 = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.345}
