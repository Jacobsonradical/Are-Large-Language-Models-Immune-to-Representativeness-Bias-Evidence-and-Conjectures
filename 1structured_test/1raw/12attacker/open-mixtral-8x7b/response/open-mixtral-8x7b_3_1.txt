To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A and B be the events that the attacker is male and the witness identified the attacker as male, respectively. Then, Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the witness's accuracy for both genders:
P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(¬B|¬A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Then, P(B) can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.8)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)(0.15) / (0.8)
= 0.15

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.15}
