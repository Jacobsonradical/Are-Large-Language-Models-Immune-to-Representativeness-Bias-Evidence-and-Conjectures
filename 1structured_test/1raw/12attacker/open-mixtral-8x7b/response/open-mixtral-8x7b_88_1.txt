To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male, given the information about the city's population and the witness's accuracy.

Let P(M) be the probability that a random person is male, P(W|M) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male person, and P(W|F) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female person as male.

From the given information:
P(M) = 0.15
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male person)
P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female person as male)

What we want to find is P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

We already know P(W|M) and P(M), and we can calculate P(W|F) * P(F) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we have:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + 0.17]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.315

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.315}
