Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male. This means there's a higher prior probability that the attacker is female.
2. However, a witness has identified the attacker as male. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying gender.
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is male, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

P(A) = 0.15 (15% chance that the attacker is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% chance that the attacker is female)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in our values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
