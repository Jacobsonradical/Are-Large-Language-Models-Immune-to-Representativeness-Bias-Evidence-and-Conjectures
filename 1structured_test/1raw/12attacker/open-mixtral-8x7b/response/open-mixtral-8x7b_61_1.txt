To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the two events are:

A: The attacker is male.
B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

From the information given, we know the following:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% chance the attacker is male given the city population)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (80% chance the witness correctly identifies a male as male under similar conditions)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male under similar conditions)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. We can calculate it as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.4138}.
