To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability that a random attacker is male, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(F) as the prior probability that a random attacker is female, which is 85% or 0.85.
P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(W|F) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to calculate P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification of the attacker as male. Bayes' theorem states:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.28

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.28}.
