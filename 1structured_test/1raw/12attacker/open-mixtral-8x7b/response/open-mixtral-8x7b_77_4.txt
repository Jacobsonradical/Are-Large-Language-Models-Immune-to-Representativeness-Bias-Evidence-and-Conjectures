To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. 

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male
- F as the event that the attacker is female
- W as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

From the problem statement, P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male) and P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female).

The witness correctly identifies a person's gender 80% of the time, so the sensitivity or true positive rate is 80%, or mathematically, P(W|M) = 0.8. Similarly, the false positive rate is 20%, or P(W|F) = 0.2.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the evidence. According to Bayes' theorem, this is:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

After calculating, we find that P(M|W) is approximately 0.3763 or 37.63%.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.3763}
