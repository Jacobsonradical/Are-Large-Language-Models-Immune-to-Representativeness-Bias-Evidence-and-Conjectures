To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is male (15% or 0.15)
P(B) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is female (85% or 0.85)
P(W|A) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male (80% or 0.8)
P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male (20% or 0.2)

We want to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B))

First, let's calculate the denominator:
(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
