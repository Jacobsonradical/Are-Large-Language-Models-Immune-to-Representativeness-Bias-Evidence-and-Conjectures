To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we are interested in finding the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

We are given:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a random attacker is male, based on city population)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the event that the witness identifies a person as male, regardless of whether the person is actually male or female. This can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.345}
