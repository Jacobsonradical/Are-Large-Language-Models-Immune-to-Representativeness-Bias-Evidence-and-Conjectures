To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

From the problem, we know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|W) = 0.413793103 (rounded to 11 decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.413793103}
