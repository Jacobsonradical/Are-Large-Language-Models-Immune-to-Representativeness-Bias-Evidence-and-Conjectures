To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote event A as "the attacker is male" and event B as "the witness identified the attacker as male".

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 1 (if the attacker is male, the witness will certainly identify him as male)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both possibilities for A:
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 0.2 (20% error rate)
- P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

So, P(B) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.46875

The answer is: {probability: 0.46875}
