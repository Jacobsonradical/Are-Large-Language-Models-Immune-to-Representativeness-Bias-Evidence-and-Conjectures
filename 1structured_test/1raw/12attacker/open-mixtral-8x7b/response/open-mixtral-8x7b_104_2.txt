To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% or 15 out of 100)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)

We also know that the total probability of the witness's identification is the sum of the probabilities of the identification given that the attacker is male and the identification given that the attacker is female. In mathematical terms, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A') where A' is the complementary event of A (i.e., the attacker is female) and P(A') = 0.85.

Since the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a female, P(W|A') = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the formula for Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|W) = 0.4137931 (rounded to 8 decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4137931}
