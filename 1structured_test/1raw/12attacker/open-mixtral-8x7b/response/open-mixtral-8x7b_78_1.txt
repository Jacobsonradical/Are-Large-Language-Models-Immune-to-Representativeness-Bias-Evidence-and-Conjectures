To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (event A) given the witness's identification (event B).

First, let's calculate P(B|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. The witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(B|¬A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male (female). The witness errs 20% of the time, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

We are given P(A), the probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (15%). Since the population is divided into males and females, P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Finally, we need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male regardless of the attacker's gender. We can find this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.345}
