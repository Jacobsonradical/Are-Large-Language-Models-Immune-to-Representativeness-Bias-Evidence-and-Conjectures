To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define:

A = Attacker is male
W = Witness identifies attacker as male

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(W|A) = 1 (if the attacker is male, the witness will correctly identify him as male 100% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (20% error rate when the witness identifies females as males)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
P(W) = (1*0.15) + (0.2*0.85)
P(W) = 0.15 + 0.17
P(W) = 0.32

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)
P(A|W) = [(1*0.15) / 0.32]
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.46875

Answer: {probability: 0.46875}
