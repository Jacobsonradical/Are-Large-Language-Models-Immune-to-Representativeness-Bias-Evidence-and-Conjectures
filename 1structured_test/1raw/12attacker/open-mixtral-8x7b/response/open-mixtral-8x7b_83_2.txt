To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is male and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given:
1. P(B|A): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male = 1 (since the attacker is definitely male if the attacker is male)
2. P(A): Probability of the attacker being male = x (unknown, to be determined)
3. P(B): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male = 0.8 (probability of correct identification by the witness)
4. P(A′): Probability of the attacker being female = 1 - P(A) = 1 - x
5. P(B|A′): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female = 0.2 (probability of error by the witness)

We need to find: P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can happen in two ways:
- If the attacker is male (A), the witness identifies correctly with a probability of 1.
- If the attacker is female (A′), the witness identifies incorrectly with a probability of 0.2.

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A′) * P(A′) = 1*x + 0.2*(1-x)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [1*x] / [1*x + 0.2*(1-x)]

However, since we don't know the exact number of people in the city or any other information that would allow us to determine x, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer. Instead, we can express the answer as a function of x:

{probability: [1*x] / [1*x + 0.2*(1-x)], a number between 0 and 1}
