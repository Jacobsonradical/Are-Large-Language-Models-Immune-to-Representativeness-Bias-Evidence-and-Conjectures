To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker is male.
- Event B: A witness identified the attacker as male.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

First, we need to find the prior probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)

Next, we need to find the probability of a witness identifying a female as male, which is:
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Now, we need to find the probability of a witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender:
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
- P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
