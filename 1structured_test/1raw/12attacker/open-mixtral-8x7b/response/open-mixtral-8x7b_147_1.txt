To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From statement (a), the witness correctly identifies a person as male 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8
From statement (b), 15% of the population is male, so P(A) = 0.15

Calculating P(B) requires us to consider all possibilities that could lead to the observation (the witness identifying the attacker as male). This includes both the true male attackers and the false positives (female attackers incorrectly identified as male).

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [P(witness identifies female as male) * P(female attacker)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.4138}
