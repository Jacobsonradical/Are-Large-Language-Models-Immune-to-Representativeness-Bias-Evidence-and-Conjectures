To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) = Probability that the attacker is male = p
P(~A) = Probability that the attacker is female = 1-p

P(W|A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male = 0.8
P(W|~A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female = 0.2

P(A) = Probability that a random person in the city is male = 0.15
P(~A) = Probability that a random person in the city is female = 0.85

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
