To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A and B represent the events that the attacker is male and the witness identified the attacker as male, respectively. Then, Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

From the given information, we have:
- P(A): probability that the attacker is male = 0.15
- P(not A): probability that the attacker is female = 0.85
- P(B|A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male = 0.8
- P(B|not A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.72

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.72}
