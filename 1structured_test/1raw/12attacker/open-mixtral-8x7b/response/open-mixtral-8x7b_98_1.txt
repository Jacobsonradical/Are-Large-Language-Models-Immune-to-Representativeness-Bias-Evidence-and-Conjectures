To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's denote:
- M: event that the attacker is male
- F: event that the attacker is female
- W: event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are interested in P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

From the information provided, we know:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) = 0.413793103 (rounded to 11 decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
