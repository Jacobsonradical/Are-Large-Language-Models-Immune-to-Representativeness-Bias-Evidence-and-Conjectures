To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the attacker is male
- B: a witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified him as male.

From the problem, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, and 50% of the population is female)

Now, we can calculate P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.1)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.085
= 0.205

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)(0.15) / 0.205
â‰ˆ 0.585

Therefore, our estimate is: {probability: 0.585}
