To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = ?

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Now, calculate P(B):
P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138 (41.38%).
