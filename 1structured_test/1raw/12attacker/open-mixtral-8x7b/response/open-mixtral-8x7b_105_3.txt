To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability that a person in the city is male (15% or 0.15)
P(F) as the prior probability that a person in the city is female (85% or 0.85)
P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male (80% or 0.8)
P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female (20% or 0.2)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

We are given all the necessary values to compute the above equation. We know that P(M) = 0.15, P(F) = 0.85, P(W|M) = 0.8, and P(W|F) = 0.2.

P(W|M) * P(M) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12
P(W|F) * P(F) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability, P(M|W):

P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

However, we want the probability that the attacker is male, P(M), given the additional information that the witness identified the attacker as male. To find that, we can use the law of total probability:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

We already know P(W|M), P(M), and P(M|W). To find P(W), we can calculate:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
P(W) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) ≈ 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given the information that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(M|W) = 0.4138 * 0.29 ≈ 0.1203

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.1203 or 12.03%.
