To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as p(M), and the probability that the attacker is female as p(F). From the information given, p(M) + p(F) = 1.

Given the city's population statistics, we know that p(F) = 0.85 and p(M) = 0.15. However, this information alone is insufficient to determine the attacker's gender since the attack occurred at night, and the victim could not see the attacker.

To incorporate the witness's information, we can assign a likelihood to the observation (the witness identifying the attacker as male) for each gender. We know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, the likelihood of the observation given that the attacker is male is p(Obs|M) = 0.8, and the likelihood of the observation given that the attacker is female is p(Obs|F) = 0.2.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male:

p(M|Obs) = p(Obs|M) * p(M) / (p(Obs|M) * p(M) + p(Obs|F) * p(F))
p(M|Obs) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
p(M|Obs) â‰ˆ 0.3061

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.3061}.
