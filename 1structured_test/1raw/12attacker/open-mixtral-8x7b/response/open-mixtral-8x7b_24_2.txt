To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the evidence (E), which is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

P(E|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's gender 80% of the time, P(E|A) = 0.8.

P(E|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|not A) = 0.2 (since the witness mistakenly identified a female as male).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.41379310344827587

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41.
