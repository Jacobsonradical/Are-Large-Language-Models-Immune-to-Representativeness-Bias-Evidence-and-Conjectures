To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event of the observed evidence (the witness identifying the attacker as male).
