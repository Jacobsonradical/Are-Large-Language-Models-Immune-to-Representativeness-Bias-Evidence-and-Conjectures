To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our initial belief (prior probability) given new evidence (likelihood).

First, let's calculate the prior probability of the attacker being male (before considering the witness's testimony). We know that 15% of the city's population is male. Since we have no other information about the attacker, we will assume that the attacker is from the city's population.

P(Male) = 0.15

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker given that the attacker is actually male (true positive rate) and given that the attacker is female (false positive rate). We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the sample of people the witness saw was half female and half male, the likelihood of the witness identifying a male is:

P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is male) = 0.8
P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is female) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is male | Witness identifies male) = [P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male)] / [P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female)]

P(Attacker is male | Witness identifies male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(Attacker is male | Witness identifies male) â‰ˆ 0.360

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.360}
