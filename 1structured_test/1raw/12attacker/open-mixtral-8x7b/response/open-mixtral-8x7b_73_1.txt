To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is male
B: A witness identified the attacker as male

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = ?

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B):
P(B|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.12) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
