To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is male and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem can be stated as:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time. This gives us P(B|A) = 0.8.
From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is male, so P(A) = 0.15.

Calculating P(B) requires us to consider both cases where the attacker is male and where the attacker is female.
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.4138}
