To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the probability that a random person in the city is male (15% or 0.15)
P(F) as the probability that a random person in the city is female (85% or 0.85)
P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male (80% or 0.8)
P(W|F) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male (20% or 0.2)
P(M|W) as the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified him as male

Now, we can calculate P(M|W):
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]
P(M|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.375

The answer is: {probability: 0.375}
