To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. We're given that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male. Let's denote these probabilities as P(F) and P(M), respectively. 

We're also given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Let's denote these probabilities as P(W|M) and P(W|F), respectively.

Now, we want to calculate P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

We're given P(W|M) = 0.8, P(W|F) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, P(M) = 0.15, and P(F) = 0.85. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this, we obtain:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.375.
