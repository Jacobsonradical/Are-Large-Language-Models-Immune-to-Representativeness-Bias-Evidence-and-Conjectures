To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) = prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 15% (0.15)
P(F) = prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 85% (0.85)
P(W|M) = probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 80% (0.8)
P(W|F) = probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 20% (0.2)

We want to find:
P(M|W) = probability of the attacker being male given the witness identified him as male

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85))

Calculating it further:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.2818

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 28.18%.
