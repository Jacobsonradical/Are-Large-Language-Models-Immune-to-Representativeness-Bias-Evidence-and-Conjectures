To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is male, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A), which is the probability of a random person in the city being male. According to the given information, 15% of the population is male, so P(A) = 0.15.

Next, let's find the likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male, P(B|A). The witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find the likelihood of the witness identifying a female as male, P(B|¬A). This is the probability of the witness making an error when identifying females, which is 20%. Since 85% of the population is female, P(¬A) = 0.85. Thus, P(B|¬A) = 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / (P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|¬A)P(¬A))
= (0.8 × 0.15) / ((0.8 × 0.15) + (0.17 × 0.85))
≈ 0.3846

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 38.46%.
