To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are interested in P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the statement, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males as males 80% of the time) and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is male).

To calculate P(W), we need to consider all possible scenarios. The probability of the witness saying yes (identifying someone as male), can be broken down into two parts: the event where the attacker is male and the event where the attacker is female:

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
        = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
        = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
        = 0.12 + 0.17
        = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
          = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
          = 0.12 / 0.29
          = 0.4137931

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41 (41%).
