To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we are interested in finding the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From statement (a), the witness correctly identifies a male as male with 80% probability, i.e., P(W|A) = 0.8. Similarly, the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male with 20% probability, i.e., P(W|~A) = 0.2 where ~A denotes the event that the attacker is female.

From statement (b), 15% of the population is male, i.e., P(A) = 0.15 and therefore, P(~A) = 0.85.

We need to calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying a person as male regardless of the attacker's actual gender. This can be calculated as:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate is {probability: 0.345, explanation: This is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, calculated using Bayes' theorem}.
