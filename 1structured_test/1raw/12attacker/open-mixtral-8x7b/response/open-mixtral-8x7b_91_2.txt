To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the evidence (E), which is the witness identifying the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

From the problem, we have:
- P(A): Prior probability that a random person in the city is male = 0.15
- P(E|A): Probability of the witness identifying a male as male = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
- P(A'): Prior probability that a random person in the city is female = 0.85
- P(E|A'): Probability of the witness identifying a female as male = 0.2 (since the witness errs in identifying gender 20% of the time)

We need to find P(E), the probability of the witness identifying someone as male regardless of the person's actual gender:
P(E) = P(E and A) + P(E and A')
= P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|E):
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
