To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are "the attacker is male" and "the witness identified the attacker as male".

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is male",
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as male".

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a male was identified by the witness.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

From the given data:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(not B|not A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a female as not male, which is also 0.8 (80%).
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (because 85% of the population is female).

We still need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A), P(not A), and P(not B|not A). We just need to find P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies a female as male. This is the complement of P(not B|not A), so P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 0.2 (20%).

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.32 = 0.12 / 0.32 = 0.375

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.375}
