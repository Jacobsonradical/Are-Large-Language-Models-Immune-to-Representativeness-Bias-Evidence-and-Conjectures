To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a person chosen at random is male)
- P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We still need to find P(W|not A), the probability that the witness identifies a female as male. This is 1 - P(W|A) = 0.2. And P(not A) is 0.85.

So, P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.13 (the overall probability of the witness making this identification).

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W) which is our required estimate:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.13) â‰ˆ 0.8462

Answer: {probability: 0.8462}
