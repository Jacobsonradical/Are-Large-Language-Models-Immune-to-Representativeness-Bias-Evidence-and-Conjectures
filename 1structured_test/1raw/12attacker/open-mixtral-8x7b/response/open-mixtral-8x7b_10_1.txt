To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the information that a witness identified the attacker as male (B).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

From the information given, we have:
- P(A): Probability of an attacker being male = 0.15 (15%)
- P(not A): Probability of an attacker being female = 0.85 (85%)
- P(B|A): Probability of a male being identified as male = 0.8 (80%)
- P(B|not A): Probability of a female being identified as male = 0.2 (20%)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / [(0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138 (41.38%)

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 41.38%.
