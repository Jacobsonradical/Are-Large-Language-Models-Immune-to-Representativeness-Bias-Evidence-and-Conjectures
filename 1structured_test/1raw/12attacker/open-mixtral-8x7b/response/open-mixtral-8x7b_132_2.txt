To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability that a person randomly selected from the city is male, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying a male, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(A|B) is the probability of the witness identifying a male given that the attacker is male.
P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying a male given that the person is randomly selected, which is the same as the witness's ability to judge gender correctly, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(B|¬A) is the probability of the witness identifying a male given that the person is female, which is the witness's ability to judge gender incorrectly, which is 20% or 0.2.

We're interested in calculating P(A|B), the posterior probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification of the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Substituting the values, we have:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345.
