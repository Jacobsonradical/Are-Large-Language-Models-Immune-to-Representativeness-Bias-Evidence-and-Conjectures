To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is male
P(A') as the probability that the attacker is female
P(W | A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male
P(W' | A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as female given that the attacker is male
P(W | A') as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female
P(W' | A') as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as female given that the attacker is female

From the given information, we have:
- P(W | A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies male 80% of the time)
- P(W' | A) = 0.2 (witness errs and identifies male as female 20% of the time)
- P(W | A') = 0.15 (witness identifies female as male 15% of the time, given that 15% of the population is male)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)

We want to find P(A | W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A | W) = P(W | A) * P(A) / P(W)

To find P(W), we need to calculate the probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as male for both male and female attackers:

P(W) = P(W | A) * P(A) + P(W | A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.1275
= 0.2475

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker is male given the witnessed identification:

P(A | W) = P(W | A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2475
â‰ˆ 0.485

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.485 or 48.5%.
