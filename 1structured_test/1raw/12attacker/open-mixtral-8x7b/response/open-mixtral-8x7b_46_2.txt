To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male.
From statement (a), we have P(M) = 0.15 since 15% of the population is male.

Let W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.
From statement (b), we have P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time) and P(W|~M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time).

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

By Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|~M) * P(~M)].

First, calculate P(W|M) * P(M) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12.

Next, calculate P(W|~M) * P(~M) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17.

Finally, calculate the denominator: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

So, P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
