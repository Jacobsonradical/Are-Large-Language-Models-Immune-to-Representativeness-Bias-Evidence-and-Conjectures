To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (P(Male)) given the information about the city's population and the witness's accuracy.

Let's first calculate some probabilities:
- P(Male) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(Female) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is male) = 0.8 (witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is male)
- P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is female) = 0.2 (witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is female)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(Male | Witness identifies male) = [P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is male) * P(Male)] / [P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is male) * P(Male) + P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is female) * P(Female)]

Plugging in the values:
P(Male | Witness identifies male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the result:
P(Male | Witness identifies male) â‰ˆ 0.375

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.375.
