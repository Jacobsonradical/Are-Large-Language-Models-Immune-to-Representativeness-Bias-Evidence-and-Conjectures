To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs about a hypothesis based on evidence.

Here, the hypothesis is "The attacker is male" and the evidence is "A witness identified the attacker as male."

First, let's calculate the prior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being male before considering the new evidence. We know that 15% of the city's population is male, so our prior probability P(H) = 0.15.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(E|H). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, P(E|H) = 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the false positive rate, which is the probability that the witness identifies someone as male when they are actually female. The complement of this is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a female as female, which happens 20% of the time when the witness is looking at females. Since 85% of the population is female, the overall rate of the witness correctly identifying a female is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate the likelihood of the evidence given that the attacker is female, P(E|~H). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female. We just calculated this to be 0.17.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability, P(H|E), which is the probability that the attacker is male given the evidence. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
â‰ˆ 0.3158

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.3158}.
