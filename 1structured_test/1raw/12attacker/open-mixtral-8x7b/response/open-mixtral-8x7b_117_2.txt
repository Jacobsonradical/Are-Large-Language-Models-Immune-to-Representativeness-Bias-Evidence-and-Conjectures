To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified him as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given data, we have:
- P(B|A): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): the probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (15%), since 15% of the population is male.
- P(B): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's gender.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both true positives (correctly identifying males as males) and false positives (erroneously identifying females as males).

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
