To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is male and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified him as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From statement (a), P(W|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is 80% or 0.8.

From statement (b), P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is male, is 15% or 0.15.

To calculate P(W), we need to consider all possibilities that lead to the observation W. This includes the attacker being male and the witness correctly identifying him as male, as well as the attacker being female and the witness incorrectly identifying her as male. So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A), where ~A represents the complement of A (attacker being female) and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

From statement (a), P(W|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 20% or 0.2.

Substituting these values into the formula for P(W), we get:
P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the available information, is approximately 0.345.
