To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male
W - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)

We need to calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be calculated as follows:
P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(A) * P(W|A) + P(not A) * P(W|not A)
= 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * (1 - 0.8) * 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
= 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 * 0.2
= 0.12 + 0.034
= 0.154

Now we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.154
= 0.078 * 100%
= 7.8%

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.078, percentage: 7.8%}.
