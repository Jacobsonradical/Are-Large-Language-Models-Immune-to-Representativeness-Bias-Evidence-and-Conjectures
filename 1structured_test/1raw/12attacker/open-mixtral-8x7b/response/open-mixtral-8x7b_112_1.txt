To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define:

A = Attacker is male
W = Witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(W|A) = 1 (if the attacker is male, the witness will correctly identify him as male 100% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (20% error rate when the witness identifies a female as male)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Then, Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|W) = [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|W) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
P(A|W) = 0.15 / 0.32
P(A|W) = 0.46875

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.46875 or 46.875%.
