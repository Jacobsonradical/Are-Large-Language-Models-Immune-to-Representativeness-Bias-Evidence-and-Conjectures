To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we are interested in finding the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness identified the attacker as male (W).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the given information, we have:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a person is male in the city)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the event that the witness identifies a person as male. This can be calculated as follows:
P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.345}
