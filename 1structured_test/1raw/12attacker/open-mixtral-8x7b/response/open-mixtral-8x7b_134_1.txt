To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is male and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the information given, we know P(B|A) which is the accuracy of the witness identifying a male as male, which is 0.8. We also know P(A), the prior probability that a random person in the city is male, which is 0.15.

To calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, we need to consider both the true males and the females misidentified as males. This is calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified him as such:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.4138}
