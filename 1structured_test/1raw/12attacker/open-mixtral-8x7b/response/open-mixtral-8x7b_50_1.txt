To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is male and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified him as male.

We are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.4138}.
