To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is male (15% or 0.15).
P(F) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is female (85% or 0.85).
P(W|M) as the probability that a male person is identified as male by the witness (80% or 0.8).
P(W|F) as the probability that a female person is identified as male by the witness (20% or 0.2).

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Substituting in the values, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)]

Calculating this expression, we get:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.375 or 37.5%

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.375}
