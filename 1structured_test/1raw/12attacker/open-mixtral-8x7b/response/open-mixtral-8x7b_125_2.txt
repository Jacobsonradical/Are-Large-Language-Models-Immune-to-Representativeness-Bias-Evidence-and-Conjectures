To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is male,
P(A') as the probability that the attacker is female,
P(W|A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male,
P(W|A') as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female,
P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being male, and
P(A'|B) as the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the additional information B.

From part (b) of the problem, we know that P(A) = 0.15 and P(A') = 0.85.

From part (a) of the problem, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(W|A') = 0.2.

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given the additional information B. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We can calculate P(B|A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male:

P(B|A) = P(W|A) = 0.8

We can calculate P(B|A') as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female:

P(B|A') = P(W|A') = 0.2

We can calculate P(B) as the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which is a weighted average of P(B|A) and P(B|A'):

P(B) = P(A) \* P(B|A) + P(A') \* P(B|A')
= 0.15 \* 0.8 + 0.85 \* 0.2
= 0.22

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.22
= 0.5455

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.5455}
