To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

First, let's find the prior probability. Based on the information given, 15% of the population in the city is male. So, our prior probability that the attacker is male is 0.15.

Next, let's find the likelihood ratio. This is the probability that a random male would be identified as male by the witness, divided by the probability that a random female would be identified as male by the witness. 

The probability that a random male would be identified as male by the witness is 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time). The probability that a random female would be identified as male by the witness is 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time). 

So, our likelihood ratio is 0.8 / 0.2 = 4.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability, which is our updated estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification. This is given by Bayes' theorem:

posterior probability = prior probability * likelihood ratio / (prior probability * likelihood ratio + (1 - prior probability))

Substituting the values we've calculated, we get:

posterior probability = 0.15 * 4 / (0.15 * 4 + (1 - 0.15)) = 0.48

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.48.
