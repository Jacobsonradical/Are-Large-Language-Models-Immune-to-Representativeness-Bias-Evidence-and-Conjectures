To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events are A (the attacker is male) and B (a witness identified the attacker as male). 

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that a male is correctly identified as male by the witness)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male, given that 15% of the city's population is male)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the true positives (males correctly identified as males) and the false positives (females incorrectly identified as males). Given that 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies a person's gender, and 85% of the population is female, the probability of the witness identifying someone as male is:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
