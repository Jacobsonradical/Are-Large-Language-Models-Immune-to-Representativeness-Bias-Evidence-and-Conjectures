To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events are A (attacker is male) and W (witness identifies the attacker as male).

Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

We know:
P(A): Probability of attacker being male = 0.15
P(W|A): Probability of witness identifying male when attacker is male = 0.80 (80% accuracy)

To find P(W), we need to calculate the probabilities for both possibilities:
- Attacker is male and witness correctly identifies: P(A) * P(W|A) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
- Attacker is female and witness incorrectly identifies as male: P(~A) * P(W|~A) = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

So, P(W) = P(A) * P(W|A) + P(~A) * P(W|~A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Answer: {probability: 0.41}
