To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% or 15 out of 100)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male regardless of whether the attacker is actually male or female. This can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
