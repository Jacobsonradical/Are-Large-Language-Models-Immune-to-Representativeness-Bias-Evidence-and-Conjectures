To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

A: The attacker is male.
B: A witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is female:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, we calculate P(B), the probability of a witness identifying someone as male:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.345}
