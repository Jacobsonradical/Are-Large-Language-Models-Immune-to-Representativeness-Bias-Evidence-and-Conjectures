To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's define:

A as the event that the attacker is male.
B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem, we know P(A), the probability that a random person from the city is male, which is 15%. We also know that P(B|A), the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, is 80%.

However, we don't directly know P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness identifying a male as male and a female as male:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
     = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
      = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
      â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
