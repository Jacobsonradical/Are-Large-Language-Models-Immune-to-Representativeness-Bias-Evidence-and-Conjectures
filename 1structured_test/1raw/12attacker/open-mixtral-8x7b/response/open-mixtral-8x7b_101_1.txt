To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We are interested in finding P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

First, we need to find P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is male, which can be calculated as the ratio of the number of males to the total population, given that 15% of the population is male:
P(A) = 0.15

Next, we need to find P(W|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 1 (100% certainty).

We also need to find P(W|¬A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male, which is the false positive rate, calculated as the product of the error rate of the witness and the prior probability of the attacker being female, given that 85% of the population is female:
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|W) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
P(A|W) ≈ 0.45

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.45.
