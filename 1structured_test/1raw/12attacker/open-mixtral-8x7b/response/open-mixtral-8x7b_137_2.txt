To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is male.
B: A witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs, identifying a female as male 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A):
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + 0.17] â‰ˆ 0.3158

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.3158 or 31.58%.
