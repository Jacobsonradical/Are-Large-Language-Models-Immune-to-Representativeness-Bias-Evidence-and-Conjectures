To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is male (15% or 0.15).
P(W|M) as the probability that a male person would be identified as male by the witness (80% or 0.8).
P(W|F) as the probability that a female person would be identified as male by the witness (20% or 0.2).
P(M|W) as the posterior probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

First, let's compute P(W): the probability that the witness identifies a person as male.
P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can compute P(M|W):
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.345}
