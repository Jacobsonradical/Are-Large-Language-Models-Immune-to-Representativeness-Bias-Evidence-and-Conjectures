To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as male (W).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a random person in the city is male)
- P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as male, which can be calculated as:
  P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
  P(W|not A) = 1 - P(W|A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
  P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person in the city is female)

So, P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Therefore, P(A|W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.35) = 0.12 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.343.
