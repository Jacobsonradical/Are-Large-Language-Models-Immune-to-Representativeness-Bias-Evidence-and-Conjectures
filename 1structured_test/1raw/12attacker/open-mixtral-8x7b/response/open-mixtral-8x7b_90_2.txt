To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is male (which is what we want to find)
P(B) as the probability that a random person in the city is male (given as 15% or 0.15)
P(A' ) as the probability that the attacker is female
P(B|A') as the probability of observing the witness's statement given that the attacker is female

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

First, we need to calculate P(B|A), the probability of observing the witness's statement given that the attacker is male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

Next, we need to calculate P(B|A'), the probability of observing the witness's statement given that the attacker is female. Since the witness errs 20% of the time when judging gender, and 85% of the population is female, this probability is 0.2 * 0.85 ≈ 0.17.

Now, since there are only two possible genders, we have P(A) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.85) / (0.17 + 0.8 * 0.85) ≈ 0.8649

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 86.49%.
