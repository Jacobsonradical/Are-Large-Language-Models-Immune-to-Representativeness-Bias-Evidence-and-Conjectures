To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified him as male. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given data, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male based on city population statistics)

To find P(B), we need to consider the two possible scenarios for the attacker's gender, A and not A (female), and their respective probabilities:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). For P(not A), it's the probability that the attacker is female, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85. For P(B|not A), it's the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time).

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345.
