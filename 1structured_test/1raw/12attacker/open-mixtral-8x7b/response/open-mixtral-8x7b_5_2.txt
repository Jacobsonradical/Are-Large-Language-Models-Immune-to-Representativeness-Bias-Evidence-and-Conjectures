To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given data, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male) and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time when the person was male).

However, we don't directly know P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for each gender: P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Here, P(not A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was female).

So, P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.345}
