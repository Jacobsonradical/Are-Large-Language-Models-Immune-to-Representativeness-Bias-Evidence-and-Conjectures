To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A = Attacker is male
W = Witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)

We also know that the witness correctly identifies a person's gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this means:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (80% chance that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)

However, we don't directly know P(W), the overall probability of the witness identifying a person as male. To find this, we need to consider both the true men and the women that the witness might incorrectly identify as men. The law of total probability states that P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|Ac) * P(Ac), where Ac denotes that the person is not male (i.e., female).

We already know P(W|A) and P(A), so we need to find P(W|Ac) and P(Ac).

P(Ac) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is female)

The witness errs 20% of the time when identifying gender, so P(W|Ac) = 0.2 (20% chance that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).

Now we can find P(W):
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|Ac) * P(Ac)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.345}
