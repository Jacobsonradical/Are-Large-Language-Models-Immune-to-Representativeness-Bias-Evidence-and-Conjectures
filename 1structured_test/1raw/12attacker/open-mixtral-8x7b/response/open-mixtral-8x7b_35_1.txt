To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) = probability that the attacker is male, which is what we want to find
P(F) = probability that the attacker is female, which is 85% (100% - 15%)
P(W|M) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 80% (0.8)
P(W|F) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 20% (0.2)

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

First, we compute the denominator:

(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we compute the numerator:

(0.8 * 0.15) = 0.12

Finally, we divide the numerator by the denominator:

P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
