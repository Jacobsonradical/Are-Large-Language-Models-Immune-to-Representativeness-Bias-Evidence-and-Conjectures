To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is male, so P(A) = 0.15.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the probability that the attacker is male AND the witness correctly identifies him as such, plus the probability that the attacker is not male (female) but the witness incorrectly identifies him as male.

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [P(B|not A) * 0.85]

From statement (a), we know that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.345}.
