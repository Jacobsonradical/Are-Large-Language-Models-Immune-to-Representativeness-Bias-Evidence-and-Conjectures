To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, 80%)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both possibilities for A (male and female) because the event B depends on A.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = (1 - 0.20) * 0.15 + (0.20) * 0.85
     = 0.13 + 0.17
     = 0.30

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = (0.80) * (0.15) / (0.30)
       = 0.40

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided is:

{probability: 0.40}
