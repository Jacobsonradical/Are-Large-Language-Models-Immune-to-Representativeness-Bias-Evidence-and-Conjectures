To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is male and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

From statement b, we know that 15% of the population is male, so P(A) = 0.15

To calculate P(W|A), we need the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, which is the complement of the witness's error rate for males. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying males, they are correct 80% of the time. So, P(W|A) = 0.8

Calculating P(W) is a bit more complex because it involves both male and female populations and the corresponding error rates. We can calculate it as follows:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)

Here, ~A is the event that the attacker is not male, i.e., female, and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

From statement a, the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying females as males. So, P(W|~A) = 0.2

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
