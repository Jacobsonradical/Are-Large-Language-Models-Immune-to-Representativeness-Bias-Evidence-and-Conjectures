To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the two events are A (the attacker being male) and B (the witness identifying the attacker as male). 

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given:
1. P(A): Probability of an attacker being male = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
2. P(B|A): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male = 1 (since if the attacker is male, he will always be identified as male)
3. P(B|A'): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female = 0.2 (20% error rate)
4. P(A'): Probability of an attacker being female = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

However, because we don't know the exact number of attackers, we cannot directly calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. Instead, we can calculate P(B) for each case (attacker being male or female) separately and then weigh them according to their probabilities:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (1*0.15) + (0.2*0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [(1*0.15) / 0.32] â‰ˆ 0.46875

Answer: {probability: 0.46875}
