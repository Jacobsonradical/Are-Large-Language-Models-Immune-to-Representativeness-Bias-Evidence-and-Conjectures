To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events are A (attacker is male) and W (witness identifies the attacker as male).

Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

P(A): Probability of attacker being male = 0.15 (15%)
P(W|A): Probability of witness identifying male attacker as male = 0.8 (80%)
P(W): Probability of witness identifying attacker as male = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
  where A' is the event that the attacker is female, P(A') = 0.85 (85%),
        P(W|A') is the probability of witness identifying a female attacker as male = 0.2 (20%)

Substituting the values:
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%)

Finally, calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41 (41%)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.41.
