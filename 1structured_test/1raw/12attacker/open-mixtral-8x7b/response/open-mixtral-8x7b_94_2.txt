To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male,
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified him as male. According to Bayes' theorem, this is equal to:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male), and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is male and where the attacker is female. Using the law of total probability, we can write:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) and P(A), and we can calculate P(not A) as 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female). What remains is to find P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies a female as male. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
