To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a fundamental theorem in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is male
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given data, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male), and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time).

Now we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the attacker being male and the witness identifying him correctly, and the attacker being female and the witness misidentifying her as male:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
     = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
      = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
      = 0.12 / 0.29
      â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.4138}
