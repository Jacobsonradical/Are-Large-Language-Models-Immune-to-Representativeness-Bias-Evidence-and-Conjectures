To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W). We can express this as P(A|W).

First, let's find the prior probability of the attacker being male (before considering the witness's identification), which we are given as 15% or 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male, which is 80% or 0.8. We also need to find the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female, which is 20% or 0.2.

Finally, we need to find the normalizing constant, which is the sum of the product of the prior probability and the likelihood for all possible values of A. In this case, there are only two possible values: male and female. So, the normalizing constant is P(W) = P(W|A=male) * P(A=male) + P(W|A=female) * P(A=female).

Putting it all together, we get:

P(A=male|W) = P(W|A=male) * P(A=male) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.136)
= 0.096 / 0.232
= 0.414

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.414, or 41.4%.
