To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A and B represent the events that the attacker is male and the witness identified the attacker as male, respectively. Then we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male with 80% probability)
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the city's population is female, so 15% is male)

To find P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is male and the case where the attacker is female:

- P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
- P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Here, A' represents the complementary event of A, i.e., the attacker is female. And P(B|A') is the probability of observing B given that A' is true, which is 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male with 20% probability). Similarly, P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the city's population is female).

Now, we can calculate P(B) as the sum of the probabilities of all possibilities that lead to event B:

- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

- P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
