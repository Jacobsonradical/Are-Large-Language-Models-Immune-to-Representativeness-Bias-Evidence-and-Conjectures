To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the two events are "the attacker is male" and "the witness identifies the attacker as male." We are given information about the witness's accuracy in identifying gender (event A) and the distribution of genders in the city's population (event B). We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.

First, we need to find some additional probabilities:
- P(B), the probability that a random person in the city is male
- P(A), the probability that the witness identifies a random person as male
- P(B|¬A), the probability that a random person is male given that the witness identifies them as female

From event B, we know that 15% of the population is male, so P(B) = 0.15.
To find P(A), we can use the law of total probability:
P(A) = P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|¬B) \* P(¬B)
    = P(A|B) \* 0.15 + P(A|¬B) \* 0.85

We know from event A that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, so:
P(A|B) = 0.8
P(A|¬B) = 0.2

Substituting these values into the equation for P(A), we get:
P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.19 + 0.17 = 0.36

We also need to find P(B|¬A), the probability that a random person is male given that the witness identifies them as female. This is the complement of P(A|¬B), which we know is 0.2, so P(B|¬A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identifies them as male:
P(B|A) = P(A|B) \* P(B) / P(A)
       = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.36
       = 0.03 / 0.09
       = 1 / 3
       = 0.333...

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.33, or 33%.
