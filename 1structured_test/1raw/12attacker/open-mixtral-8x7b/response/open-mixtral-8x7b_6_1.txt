To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness identified the attacker as male (W).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a male as male with 80% probability and a female as male with 20% probability. Since 15% of the population is male, P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(W|not A) = 0.2.

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is male, so P(A) = 0.15.

We need to calculate P(W), the probability of the witness identifying anyone as male. This is the weighted sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying a male and a female as male. So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.85) = 0.2 + 0.17 = 0.37.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8*0.15) / 0.37 â‰ˆ 0.324.

Answer: {probability: 0.324}
