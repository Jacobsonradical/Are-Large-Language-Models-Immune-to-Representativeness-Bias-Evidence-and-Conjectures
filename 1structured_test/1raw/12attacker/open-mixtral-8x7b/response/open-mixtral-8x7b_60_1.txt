To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A = Attacker is male
W = Witness identifies attacker as male

Then Bayes' theorem states: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying anyone as male. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness identifying a male correctly and identifying a female as a male:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.345}
