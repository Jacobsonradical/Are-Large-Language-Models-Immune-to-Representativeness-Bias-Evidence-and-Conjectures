To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial belief (prior probability) based on new evidence (witness testimony).

First, let's calculate the prior probability. Since 15% of the population is male, without any other information, our initial belief would be that there's a 15% chance the attacker is male.

Next, we apply Bayes' theorem. The formula is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is male and B is the event of the witness identifying the attacker as male.

From the problem, we know that P(B|A) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male) is 1 (since the witness identified the attacker as male). And we calculated above that P(A) (the prior probability) is 0.15.

We need to calculate P(B), which is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can occur in two ways: correctly identifying a male attacker or mistakenly identifying a female attacker. 

The probability of correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 (from the problem), and the probability of a male attacker is 0.15 (our prior probability). So, the probability of correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

The probability of mistakenly identifying a female attacker is 0.2 (from the problem), and the probability of a female attacker is 0.85 (from the problem). So, the probability of mistakenly identifying a female attacker is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the posterior probability, which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.517.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.517}.
