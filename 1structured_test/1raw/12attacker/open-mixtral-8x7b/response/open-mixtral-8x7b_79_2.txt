To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is male" and "the witness identified the attacker as male."

Let A represent the event "the attacker is male," and B represent the event "the witness identified the attacker as male."

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is male. We know that 15% of the population is male, so we can use this as our prior probability, P(A) = 0.15.

Now we need to find P(B). To do this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. To find P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male, we can use the complementary probability:

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A)

The witness identifies gender correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, the probability that the witness identifies a female as male is 20%. Therefore, P(not B|not A) = 0.2. Thus, P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now we need to find P(not A), the prior probability that the attacker is not male. Since 85% of the population is female, P(not A) = 0.85.

Now we can find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Now we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8
= 0.15 / 0.8
= 0.1875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.1875}.
