To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events are "the attacker is male" (A) and "the witness identified the attacker as male" (B).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male = 1 (since the attacker is definitely male if the attacker is male)
- P(A): Probability that the attacker is male = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|not A): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)
- P(not A): Probability that the attacker is not male = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.15 / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.46875.
