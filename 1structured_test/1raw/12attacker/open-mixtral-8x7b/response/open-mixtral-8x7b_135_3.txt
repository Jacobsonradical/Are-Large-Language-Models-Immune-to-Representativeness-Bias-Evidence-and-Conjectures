To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the information about the city's population (B) and the witness's identification (C). So, we need to calculate P(A|B&C).

First, let's find P(C|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

Next, let's find P(C|~A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male (female). This is the false positive rate, given as 20% or 0.2.

Now, let's find P(A), the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the city's population. And P(~A) is 85% or 0.85.

Finally, let's find P(B), the probability of the city having such a skewed gender distribution, which is not relevant to our calculation since it doesn't change the probability of A given B&C.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B&C) = P(C|A) * P(A) / [P(C|A) * P(A) + P(C|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B&C) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|B&C) â‰ˆ 0.375 or 37.5%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 37.5%.
