To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(M), and the probability that the attacker is female as P(F). From the information given, P(M) = 0.15 and P(F) = 0.85.

Now, let's consider the witness's statement. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means that the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male, is 0.8, and the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually female, is 0.2.

Let's denote the witness's statement as E. We want to find P(M|E), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(M|E) = P(E|M) \* P(M) / [P(E|M) \* P(M) + P(E|F) \* P(F)]

We know that P(E|M) = 0.8 and P(E|F) = 0.2. Plugging in these values, we get:

P(M|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating this value, we get:

P(M|E) â‰ˆ 0.375

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the population statistics, is approximately 0.375.
