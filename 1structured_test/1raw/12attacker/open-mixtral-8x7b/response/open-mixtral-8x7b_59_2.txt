To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs given new evidence. 

Let's denote:
- M: the event that the attacker is male
- F: the event that the attacker is female
- W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are interested in finding P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the problem, we have:
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(W|M) = 1 (the witness always identifies males as males)
P(W|F) = 0.2 (20% error rate for identifying females as males)

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Calculating this expression will give us:
P(M|W) = (1 * 0.15) / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.2979

Answer: {probability: 0.2979}
