To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness identified the attacker as male (B).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a male as male with 80% probability, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is male, so P(A) = 0.15.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both possibilities - that the attacker is male or female. 

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.345}
