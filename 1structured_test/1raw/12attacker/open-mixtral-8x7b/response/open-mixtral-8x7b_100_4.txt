To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) = Probability that the attacker is male
P(~A) = Probability that the attacker is female
P(W|A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male
P(W|~A) = Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female
P(A) = P(Male) = 0.15 (from statement b)
P(~A) = P(Female) = 0.85 (from statement b)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (from statement a)
P(W|~A) = 0.2 (from statement a)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A))

Substituting the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.2885

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.2885 or 28.85%.
