To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is male and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the given information, we have:
P(W|A) = 1 (since if the attacker is male, the witness will always identify him as male)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% male population)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two possibilities for the attacker: male or female. So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (1*0.15) + (0.2*0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now, we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (1*0.15) / 0.32
â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.46875}
