To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let event A be the attacker being male, and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as male.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, where A' is the event of the attacker being female)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = ?

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

First, calculate P(B|A'):
P(B|A') = 1 - P(B'|A') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Then, calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is approximately 0.345.
