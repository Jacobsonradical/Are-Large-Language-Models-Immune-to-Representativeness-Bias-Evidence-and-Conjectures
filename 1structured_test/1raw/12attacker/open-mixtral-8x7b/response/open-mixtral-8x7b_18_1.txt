To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
1. P(A): Probability of an arbitrary person being male = 0.15
2. P(W|A): Probability of the witness identifying a male as male = 0.8 (20% error rate)
3. P(W|not A): Probability of the witness identifying a female as male = 0.2 (since 20% of the time the witness errs)

However, we are not given P(W), the total probability of the witness identification. We can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

So, P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.343.
