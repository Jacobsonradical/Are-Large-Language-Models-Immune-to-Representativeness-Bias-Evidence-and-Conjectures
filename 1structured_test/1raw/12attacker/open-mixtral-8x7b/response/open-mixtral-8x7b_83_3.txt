To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:
A = The attacker is male
B = A witness identified the attacker as male

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that a male is correctly identified as male by the witness)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a person chosen at random in the city is male)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is male and the case where the attacker is female.
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)

Now, let's compute the answer:

{probability: 0.3793103448275862}
