To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is male and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)

To find P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is male and the case where the attacker is female. Given that the witness makes errors with a probability of 0.2, we have:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

So, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
      = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
      = 0.333...

Answer: {probability: 0.33, explanation: The estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.33, given the witness's identification and the city's population statistics.}
