To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. 

Let's define:
- Event A: The attacker is male
- Event B: A witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified him as male.

From the information given, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(B|Ac) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, where Ac is the event that the attacker is female)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is male and where the attacker is female:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|Ac) * P(Ac)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345.
