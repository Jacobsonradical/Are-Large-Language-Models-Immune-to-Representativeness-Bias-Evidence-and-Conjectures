To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- M: the event that the attacker is male
- F: the event that the attacker is female
- W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are interested in computing P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, we need to find the prior probabilities:
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Next, we need to find the likelihoods:
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.41379310344827587

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41.
