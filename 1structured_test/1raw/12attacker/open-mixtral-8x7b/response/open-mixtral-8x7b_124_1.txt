To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:
- M: The event that the attacker is male.
- F: The event that the attacker is female.
- W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are interested in finding P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

From the given information, we know P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male) and P(W|M) = 1 (because if the attacker is male, the witness will certainly identify him as male).

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two possibilities:
1. The attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies him as male: P(W|M) * P(M) = 1 * 0.15 = 0.15
2. The attacker is female but the witness mistakenly identifies her as male: P(W|F) * P(F) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Thus, P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Finally, we can calculate P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.4688

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is: {probability: 0.4688}
