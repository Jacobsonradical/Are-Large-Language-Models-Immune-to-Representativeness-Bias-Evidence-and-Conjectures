To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(M), and the probability that the attacker is female as P(F). We are given that P(F) = 0.85 and P(M) = 0.15.

The witness identified the attacker as male. We will use the witness's accuracy to update our belief in the attacker's gender. The witness is correct 80% of the time. We can think of this as the probability of observing a "male" report (W) given that the attacker is truly male, P(W|M). Similarly, the probability of observing a "male" report given that the attacker is truly female is P(W|F) = 0.20, as the witness errs 20% of the time.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Now, we can fill in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))

Calculating the above expression gives:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.397

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.397}
