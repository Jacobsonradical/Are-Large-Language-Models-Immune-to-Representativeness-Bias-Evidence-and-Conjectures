To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

P(A) as the probability the attacker is male = 0.15 (from the given information, 15% of the city's population is male).
P(B) as the probability a witness identifies someone as male = 0.8 (given information).
P(A|B) as the probability the attacker is male given the witness identified someone as male.
P(B|A) as the probability a witness identifies a male as male = 0.8 (given information).
P(B|¬A) as the probability a witness identifies a female as male = 0.2 (given information, 1 - P(B|A)).

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(¬A) * P(B|¬A)

0.8 = (0.15) * (0.8) + (0.85) * (0.2)

Now, we can solve for P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(A) * P(B|A)) / P(B)

P(A|B) = ((0.15) * (0.8)) / 0.8

P(A|B) ≈ 0.1875

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.1875}
