To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- M: the event that the attacker is male
- F: the event that the attacker is female
- W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

From the information given, we have:
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We want to find: P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(M|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
