To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male
- F as the event that the attacker is female
- W as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are interested in P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

From the information given, we know:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time)

Substituting these probabilities into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.338

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.338.
