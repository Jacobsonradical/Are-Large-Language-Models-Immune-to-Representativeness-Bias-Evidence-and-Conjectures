To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W).

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:
- P(W|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15%), since 15% of the city's population is male.
- P(W) is the total probability of the witness identification, which can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying male when the attacker is male and identifying male when the attacker is female.

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
