To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is male and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified him as male.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From part (a) of the information, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's gender as male 80% of the time. So, P(W|A) = 0.8.

From part (b) of the information, we know that 15% of the city's population is male. Assuming that the attackers are chosen randomly from this city's population, we have P(A) = 0.15.

To find P(W), we need to consider the cases where the attacker is male and where the attacker is female. That is, P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A).

We have P(W and A) = P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

For P(W and not A), we use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying a person as male. Since 85% of the population is female, this means that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of 85% which equals 0.17.

Thus, P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345 (rounded to three decimal places).

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is:

{probability: 0.345}
