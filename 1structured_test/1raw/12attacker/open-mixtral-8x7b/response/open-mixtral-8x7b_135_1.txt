To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker being male" and "the witness identifying the attacker as male."

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is male"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as male"

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

From the information given, we know:
- P(A), the probability that the attacker is male, is 0.15 (15%) because 15% of the population is male.
- P(not A), the probability that the attacker is female, is 0.85 (85%).
- P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, is 1 (100%) because we assume the witness is correct.
- P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, is 0.2 (20%) because the witness errs 20% of the time.

Now we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.15 / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.4688

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4688 (or 46.88%).
