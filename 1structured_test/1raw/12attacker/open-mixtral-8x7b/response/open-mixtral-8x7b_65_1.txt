To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

From the information provided, we know:
- P(A): Probability of attacker being male = 0.15
- P(not A): Probability of attacker being female = 0.85
- P(W|A): Probability of correct identification given the attacker is male = 1
- P(W|not A): Probability of incorrect identification given the attacker is female = 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem gives:
P(A|W) = (1 * 0.15) / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.68 * 0.85)] = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.572) = 0.15 / 0.722 â‰ˆ 0.2078 or 20.78%

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 20.78%.
