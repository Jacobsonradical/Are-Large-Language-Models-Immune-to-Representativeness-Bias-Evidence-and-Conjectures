To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let A be the event that the attacker is male and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as male 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the attack happened at night and the victim could not see the attacker's gender, we assume that the witness has a 50% chance of guessing correctly. So, P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the male attacker as male) and P(W|not A) = 0.5 (witness incorrectly identifies the female attacker as male).

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the city's population is male. Therefore, P(A) = 0.15.

To calculate P(W), we need to find the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can be calculated as: P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8*0.15) + (0.5*0.85) = 0.12 + 0.425 = 0.545

Now, we can calculate P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8*0.15) / 0.545 â‰ˆ 0.2165

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.2165}.
