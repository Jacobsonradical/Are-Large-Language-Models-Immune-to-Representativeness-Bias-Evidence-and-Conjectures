To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) = probability that a person is male in the city (15%)
P(F) = probability that a person is female in the city (85%)
P(W|M) = probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male (80%)
P(W|F) = probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male (20%)

Now, we want to calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(M|W) = P(W and M) / P(W)

First, we'll find P(W and M):
P(W and M) = P(W|M) * P(M) = (0.8)(0.15)

Next, we'll find P(W):
P(W) = P(W and M) + P(W and F) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)

Finally, we'll calculate P(M|W):
P(M|W) = P(W and M) / P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) / ((0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.3846

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.3846}.
