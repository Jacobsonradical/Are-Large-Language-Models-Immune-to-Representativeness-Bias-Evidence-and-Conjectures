To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote the event that the attacker is male as A and the event that the witness identified the attacker as male as B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male is 80%)

We need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be calculated as follows:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.345}
