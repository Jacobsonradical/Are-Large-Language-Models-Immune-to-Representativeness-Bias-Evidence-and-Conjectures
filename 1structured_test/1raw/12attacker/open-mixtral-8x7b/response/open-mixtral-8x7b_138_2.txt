To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is male" and "the witness identified the attacker as male".

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given that event B has occurred. This is what we want to find.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given that event A has occurred. This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. This is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A. This is the probability that the attacker is male before considering the witness's statement. We don't know this, but we can express it as a proportion of the total population, which is the number of males divided by the total number of people. Given that 15% of the population is male, this is 0.15.
- P(B) is the probability of event B. This is the probability that the witness identifies someone as male. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the person is male and the witness correctly identifies them as male, and the probability that the person is female and the witness incorrectly identifies them as male. This is (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.12 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.343.
