To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker being male" and "the witness identifying the attacker as male."

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is male"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as male"

According to the problem description, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, and 80% of the city's population is female)

We can now compute P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male regardless of the attacker's actual gender:

P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ ¬A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.16 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.136
= 0.256

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.256
≈ 0.46875

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.46875}
