To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that "the attacker is male" and B be the event that "a witness identified the attacker as male". 

From part (a), we have P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male is 80%).
From part (b), we have P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the true males that the witness correctly identifies and the females that the witness mistakenly identifies as males. So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(A) * P(B|A)] + [P(not A) * P(B|not A)]
= (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)
= 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.32

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32
â‰ˆ 0.375

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is:

{probability: 0.375}
