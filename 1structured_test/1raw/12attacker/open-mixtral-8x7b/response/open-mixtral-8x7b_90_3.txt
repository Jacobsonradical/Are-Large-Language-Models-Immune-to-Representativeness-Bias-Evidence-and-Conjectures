To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are "the attacker is male" and "the witness identified the attacker as male".

Let A represent the event "the attacker is male", and B represent the event "the witness identified the attacker as male". 

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is male, which is 15% or 0.15 since 15% of the city's population is male.
- P(B): This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be calculated as the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying the male attacker and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female attacker as male. This is 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*(1-0.15) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.41 â‰ˆ 0.366

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.366 or 36.6%.
