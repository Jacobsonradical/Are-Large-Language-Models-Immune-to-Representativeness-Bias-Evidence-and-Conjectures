To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our initial belief (prior probability) given new evidence (witness testimony).

First, we find the prior probability using the city's population statistics:
P(Attacker is Male) = 0.15 (15% male population)

Next, we need to find the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker, which is given as 80%:
P(Witness identifies Male | Attacker is Male) = 0.8

We also need to find the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male, which is given as 20%:
P(Witness identifies Male | Attacker is Female) = 0.2

Now we use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness testimony:
P(Attacker is Male | Witness identifies Male) = [P(Witness identifies Male | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male)] / P(Witness identifies Male)

We need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying male:
P(Witness identifies Male) = P(Witness identifies Male and Attacker is Male) + P(Witness identifies Male and Attacker is Female)
= [P(Witness identifies Male | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male)] + [P(Witness identifies Male | Attacker is Female) * P(Attacker is Female)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(Attacker is Male | Witness identifies Male) = [P(Witness identifies Male | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male)] / P(Witness identifies Male)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.4138}
