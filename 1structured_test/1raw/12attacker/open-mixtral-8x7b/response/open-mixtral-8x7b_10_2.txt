To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (P(Male)), given the information about the population and the witness. We can express this as:

P(Male | Info) = P(Info | Male) * P(Male) / P(Info)

We know P(Male) from the city's population, which is 15% or 0.15.

To compute P(Info | Male), we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male (event A) given that the attacker is male. This is directly given as 80%, or 0.8.

To compute P(Info), we need to find the total probability of the information, which involves the witness identifying the attacker as male (event A) and identifying the attacker as female (event B).

P(Info) = P(A)*P(Male) + P(B)*P(Female)

From the problem, we know that P(Male) = 0.15 and P(Female) = 0.85. We also know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, we can express P(A) and P(B) as:

P(A) = P(A | Male)*P(Male) + P(A | Female)*P(Female) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.205

P(B) = P(B | Male)*P(Male) + P(B | Female)*P(Female) = 0.2*0.15 + 0.8*0.85 = 0.795

Therefore, P(Info) = 0.205*0.15 + 0.795*0.85 = 0.72825

Now we can calculate P(Male | Info):

P(Male | Info) = P(Info | Male) * P(Male) / P(Info) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.72825 â‰ˆ 0.1578

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the information, is approximately 0.1578 or 15.78%.
