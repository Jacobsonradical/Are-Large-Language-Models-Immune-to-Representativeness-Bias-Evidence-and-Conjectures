To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a way to find the probability of a hypothesis after considering evidence. Bayes' theorem can be written as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that "the attacker is male" and B be the event "the witness identified the attacker as male". We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time) where ~A is the event that "the attacker is not male" or "the attacker is female"

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male regardless of the attacker's gender. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
