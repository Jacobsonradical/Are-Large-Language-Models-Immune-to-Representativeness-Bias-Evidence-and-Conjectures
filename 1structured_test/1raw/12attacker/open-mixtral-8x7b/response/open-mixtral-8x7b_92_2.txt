To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is male (15% or 0.15)
P(F) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is female (85% or 0.85)
P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male (80% or 0.8)
P(W|F) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male (20% or 0.2)
P(M|W) as the posterior probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M)*P(M) + P(W|F)*P(F))

First, we calculate the likelihood of the witness identifying a person as male:
P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(M|W) = (0.8*0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.41}
