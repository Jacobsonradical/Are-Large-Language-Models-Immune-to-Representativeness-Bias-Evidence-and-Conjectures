To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified him as male.

From the problem, we are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
- P(not A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is female, given that 15% of the city's population is male)

Then, Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
