To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after observing new evidence.

Our prior probability (before considering the witness's statement) is the proportion of males in the city, which is 0.15.

The likelihood ratio is the probability of the evidence given the suspect is male divided by the probability of the evidence given the suspect is female. The probability of the evidence given the suspect is male is 1 (since the witness identified the attacker as male), and the probability of the evidence given the suspect is female is the false positive rate, or 0.20.

So, the likelihood ratio is 1 / 0.20 = 5.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability is equal to the prior probability times the likelihood ratio divided by the prior probability times the likelihood ratio plus one minus the prior probability. Substituting in our values gives:

Posterior probability = (0.15 * 5) / ((0.15 * 5) + (1 - 0.15))
Posterior probability = 0.75 / (0.75 + 0.85)
Posterior probability = 0.75 / 1.6

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.46875, explanation: This estimate is based on the proportion of males in the city and the reliability of the witness's gender identification.}
