To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- M: the event that the attacker is male
- F: the event that the attacker is female
- W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

From the information given, we have:
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is female)
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)
P(W|F) = 0.20 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the true gender is female)
P(W|M) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

By Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

We need to calculate P(W), the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can be calculated as:
P(W) = P(W and M) + P(W and F)
= P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)
= (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.345}
