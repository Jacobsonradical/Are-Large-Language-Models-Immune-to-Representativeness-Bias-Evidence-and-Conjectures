To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (event A) given the witness's identification (event B).

First, let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is male, P(B|A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, and P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male (female).

From the given information, P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time), and P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female). Since the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying the gender, P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is estimated to be {probability: 0.36}.
