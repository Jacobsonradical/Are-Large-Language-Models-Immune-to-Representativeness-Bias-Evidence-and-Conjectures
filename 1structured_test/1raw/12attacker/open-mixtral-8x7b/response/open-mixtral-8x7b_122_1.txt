To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) = probability that a random person in the city is male (15% or 0.15)
P(W|M) = probability that the witness identifies a male as male (80% or 0.8)
P(W|F) = probability that the witness identifies a female as male (20% or 0.2)
P(F) = probability that a random person in the city is female (85% or 0.85)
P(attacker is M | witness identifies male) = probability we want to calculate

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is M | witness identifies male) = P(witness identifies male | attacker is M) * P(attacker is M) / P(witness identifies male)

We need to calculate the term P(witness identifies male), which can be calculated as follows:

P(witness identifies male) = P(witness identifies male | attacker is M) * P(attacker is M) + P(witness identifies male | attacker is F) * P(attacker is F)

Now, we can calculate the term P(witness identifies male | attacker is F) as follows:

P(witness identifies male | attacker is F) = 1 - P(witness identifies female | attacker is F) = 1 - P(W|F) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

So,

P(witness identifies male) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) + (P(W|F) * P(F)) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(attacker is M | witness identifies male) = P(witness identifies male | attacker is M) * P(attacker is M) / P(witness identifies male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.15

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 or 15%.
