To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a way to find the probability of a hypothesis after considering evidence. Here, the hypothesis is that the attacker is male, and the evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

First, let's find the prior probability of the attacker being male based on the city's population:
P(male) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's find the probability of the witness identifying a person as male given that the person is actually male, which is 80% or 0.8 for the witness.

Similarly, let's find the probability of the witness identifying a person as male given that the person is actually female, which is 20% or 0.2 for the witness.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(male|witness identifies male) = [P(witness identifies male|male) * P(male)] / P(witness identifies male)

We need to find the denominator P(witness identifies male), which can be calculated as follows:
P(witness identifies male) = P(witness identifies male and male is true) + P(witness identifies male and male is false)
= P(witness identifies male|male) * P(male) + P(witness identifies male|female) * P(female)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(male|witness identifies male) = [P(witness identifies male|male) * P(male)] / P(witness identifies male)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.414

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
