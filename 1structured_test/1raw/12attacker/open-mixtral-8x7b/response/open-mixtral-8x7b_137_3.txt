To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is male, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs in gender identification 20% of the time)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B)

First, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male regardless of whether the attacker is actually male or female:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B)
= P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
