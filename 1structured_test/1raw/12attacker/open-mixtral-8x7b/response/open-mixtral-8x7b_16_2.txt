To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial belief about the attacker's gender (prior probability) based on new evidence (witness testimony).

First, let's calculate the prior probability. This is the probability that a random person in the city is male, which according to the given data is 15%.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratio. This is the probability that a male would be identified as male divided by the probability that a female would be identified as male. Using the provided statistics, this comes out to be 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a male) divided by 0.2 (probability of mistakenly identifying a female as male) which equals 4.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability, or the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony, by multiplying the prior probability by the likelihood ratio. This gives us 0.15 * 4 = 0.6, or 60%.

So, the answer is {probability: 0.6}.
