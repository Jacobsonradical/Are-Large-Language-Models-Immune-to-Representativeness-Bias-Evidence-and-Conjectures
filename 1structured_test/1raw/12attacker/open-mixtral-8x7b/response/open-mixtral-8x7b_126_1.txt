To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability that a person randomly picked from the city is male, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as male, which is 80% or 0.8 when the person is actually male, and 20% or 0.2 when the person is actually female.
P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to calculate P(A|B), which can be done using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.345}
