To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's define:
- Event A: The attacker is male
- Event B: A witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided, we know:
- P(A): The prior probability that a person chosen at random in the city is male, which is 15% or 0.15
- P(B|A): The probability that a male is identified as male by the witness, which is 80% or 0.8
- P(B): The probability that the attacker is identified as male by the witness, regardless of the attacker's actual gender

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is male and where the attacker is female:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
