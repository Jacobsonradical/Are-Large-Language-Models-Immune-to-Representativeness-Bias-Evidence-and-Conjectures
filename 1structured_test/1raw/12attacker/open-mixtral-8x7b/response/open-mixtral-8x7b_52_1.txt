To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A and B represent the events "the attacker is male" and "the witness identified the attacker as male", respectively. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 1 (if the attacker is male, the witness will always identify him as male)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is male and where the attacker is female. Using the law of total probability, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). We are given P(B|A) and P(A), and we can infer P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female). To find P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, we can use the information about the witness's accuracy: P(B|not A) = 0.2 (20% error rate).

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.32

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (1 * 0.15) / 0.32
â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.46875}
