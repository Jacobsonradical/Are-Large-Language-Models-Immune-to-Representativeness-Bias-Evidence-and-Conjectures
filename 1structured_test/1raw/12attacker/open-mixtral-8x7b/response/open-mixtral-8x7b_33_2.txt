To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - attacker is male
A' - attacker is not male (female)
W - witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males as males 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')

We know P(W|A) and P(A), and we can calculate P(W|A') as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as a male, which is 1 - P(W|A') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
We also know P(A'), which is the complement of P(A), so P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get:
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the available information is approximately 0.414.
