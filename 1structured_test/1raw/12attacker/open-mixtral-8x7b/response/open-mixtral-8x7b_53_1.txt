To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male given the information that a witness identified the attacker as male.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is male.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

From the given information, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's gender as male 80% of the time, and identifies a female as male 20% of the time. We also know that the city's population is 85% female and 15% male.

We can calculate P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, as 0.8 (or 80%).

We can calculate P(A), the probability that the attacker is male, as 0.15 (or 15%), since 15% of the city's population is male.

We can calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies a person as male, as follows:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (or 29%)

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (or about 41.4%)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
