To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

From the information given, we know that:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identification, which can be calculated as follows:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)
      = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
      = 0.12 / 0.29
      â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
