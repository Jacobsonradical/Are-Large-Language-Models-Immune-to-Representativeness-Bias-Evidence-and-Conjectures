To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male).

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is male or the attacker is female. So, P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A).

We're given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, so P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness identifies a female as male 20% of the time). And, since 85% of the population is female, P(not A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get:

P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
