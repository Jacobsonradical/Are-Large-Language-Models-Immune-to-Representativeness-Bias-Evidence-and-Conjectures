To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is male (our quantity of interest).
P(B) as the probability that a random person from the city is male, given that 15% of the population is male.
P(A'') as the probability that the witness identifies someone as male, given that the person is actually male.
P(B'') as the probability that the witness identifies someone as male, given that the person is actually female.

We are given:
P(A'') = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(B'') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)

First, we need to find P(A''), P(B), P(B'') and P(B'')|A'), where P(B'')|A') is the probability that the witness identifies someone as male, given that the person is female, which is 1 - P(B'') (since there are only two possibilities: male or female).

P(A'') = 0.8
P(B) = 0.15
P(B'') = 0.2
P(B'')|A') = 1 - P(B'') = 0.8

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Since we don't have information about P(A), let's use the principle of indifference and assign it a uniform distribution, i.e., P(A) = P(A') = 0.5 (assuming no prior knowledge about the attacker's gender).

P(B|A) represents the probability of the witness identifying a male as male, given that the person is male, which is P(A'') = 0.8.

Now we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.15
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.667 or 66.7%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 66.7%.
