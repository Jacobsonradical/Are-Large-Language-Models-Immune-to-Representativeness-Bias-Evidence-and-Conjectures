To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (P(Male)) given the information that a witness identified the attacker as male (P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is male)).

First, let's define our terms:
- P(Male) is the probability that a random attacker in the city is male, which we know from statement (a) is 0.15.
- P(Female) is the probability that a random attacker in the city is female, which we know from statement (a) is 0.85.
- P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is male) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker, which we know from statement (b) is 0.8.
- P(Witness identifies male | Attacker is female) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male, which we know from statement (b) is 0.2.

We want to find P(Attacker is male | Witness identifies male).

Bayes' theorem states:

P(Male | Witness identifies male) = P(Witness identifies male | Male) \* P(Male) / P(Witness identifies male)

We can calculate P(Witness identifies male) using the law of total probability:

P(Witness identifies male) = P(Witness identifies male | Male) \* P(Male) + P(Witness identifies male | Female) \* P(Female)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(Male | Witness identifies male):

P(Male | Witness identifies male) = P(Witness identifies male | Male) \* P(Male) / P(Witness identifies male)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.321

So, based on the information provided, we estimate that there is a 32.1% chance that the attacker is male.
