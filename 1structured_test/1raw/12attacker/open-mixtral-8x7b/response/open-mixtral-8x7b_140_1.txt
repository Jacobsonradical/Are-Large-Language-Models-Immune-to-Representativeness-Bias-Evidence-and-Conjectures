To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is male and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that when the witness is correct, they identify the correct gender 80% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, P(B|A) = 0.8.

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is male. Therefore, P(A) = 0.15.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is actually male and the case where the attacker is female, but the witness incorrectly identifies them as male. For the first case, the probability is P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. For the second case, the probability of the witness identifying someone as male when they are not is 20% (from statement (a)), and the probability that the attacker is female is 85% (from statement (b)). Therefore, the probability for the second case is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Since these are mutually exclusive events, P(B) is the sum of these probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345.

However, there is one more consideration. Statement (a) doesn't explicitly state that the witness identifies males more often than females. It only states that the witness is correct 80% of the time. If the witness is equally likely to be correct for both males and females, then the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male would be the same as the prior probability, which is 15%.

Taking both possibilities into account, a conservative estimate would be to use the lower value, which is P(A) = 0.15, since that is the minimum probability that the attacker is male given the observed data.

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
