To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A and B be the events that the attacker is male and that the witness identified the attacker as male, respectively. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, we need to find P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male (i.e., female). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

We also need to find P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is male. Since 15% of the population is male, P(A) = 0.15.

Finally, we need to find P(not A), the prior probability that the attacker is not male. Since 85% of the population is female, P(not A) = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17)
= 0.36

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.36}.
