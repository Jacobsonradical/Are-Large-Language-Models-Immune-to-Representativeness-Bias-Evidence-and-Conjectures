To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is male" and "the witness identified the attacker as male."

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is male (which is 0.15 based on the city's population).
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male (which is 0.8, as stated in the problem).
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male (which we want to calculate).
- P(¬A) as the probability that the attacker is female (which is 0.85 based on the city's population).
- P(¬B|¬A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female (which is 0.2, as stated in the problem).

We can calculate P(B) as follows:
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Using the values above, we get:
P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is 0.29.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.29}
