To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability that a person randomly selected from the city is male, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
P(B) as the prior probability of being identified as male by the witness, which is given as 80% or 0.8 for a randomly selected male. For a randomly selected female, the probability is 20% or 0.2.
P(A') as the prior probability that a person randomly selected from the city is female, which is 85% or 0.85.
P(B|A') as the probability of being identified as male by the witness for a randomly selected female, which is 20% or 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(B), the probability of being identified as male by the witness, regardless of whether the person is male or female:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A') = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability, P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male, given that they were identified as male by the witness:

P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345 or 34.5%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.345}
