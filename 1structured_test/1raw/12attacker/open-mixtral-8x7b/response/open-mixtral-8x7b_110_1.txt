To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial belief (prior probability) based on evidence (witness report).

The prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% (0.15) since 15% of the city's population is male. 

The witness accurately identifies gender 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means that when observing a man, there's an 80% chance the witness will say "male," and when observing a woman, there's a 20% chance the witness will say "male."

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event "the attacker is male," and B be the event "the witness identified the attacker as male."
