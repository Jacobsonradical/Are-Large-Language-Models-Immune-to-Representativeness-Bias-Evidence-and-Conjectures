To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Pr(A): probability that the attacker is male
- Pr(W|A): probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male (which is 1 since the witness identified the attacker as male)
- Pr(W|not A): probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male (which is the error rate of the witness, 20%)
- Pr(A'): probability that the attacker is not male (which is 1 - Pr(A))
- Pr(not A): probability that the attacker is female (which is 85% based on the city's population)

According to Bayes' theorem,

Pr(A|W) = (Pr(W|A) \* Pr(A)) / (Pr(W|A) \* Pr(A) + Pr(W|not A) \* Pr(not A))

Substituting the values, we have:

Pr(A|W) = (1 \* Pr(A)) / ((1 \* Pr(A)) + (0.2 \* 0.85))

To find Pr(A), we need to decide what prior probability we want to use. Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, a reasonable prior probability might be that the attacker is male and female with equal probability, i.e., Pr(A) = 0.5.

Substituting this value, we get:

Pr(A|W) = (1 \* 0.5) / ((1 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.85)) = 0.5476

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.5476}
