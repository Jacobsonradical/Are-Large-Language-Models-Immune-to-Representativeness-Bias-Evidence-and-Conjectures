To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is male and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a male as male with a probability of 0.8 and misidentifies a male as female with a probability of 0.2. Since the population is approximately divided into halves, we can say that the probability of a random person being male is 0.5 (P(A)=0.5).

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is male, so the probability of randomly selecting a male is 0.15 (P(A)) and the probability of randomly selecting a female is 0.85 (P(not A)). 

Given that the witness identified the person as male, the probability that the person is actually male is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= [0.8 * 0.5] / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5]
= 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)
= 0.8 / 1
= 0.8

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's accuracy is the same for both genders. To take into account the different accuracy for females, we would need more information about the witness's ability to judge a person's gender when they are female.

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.8. {probability: 0.8}
