To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is male (15% or 0.15).
P(F) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is female (85% or 0.85).
P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies a male as male (80% or 0.8).
P(W|F) as the probability that the witness identifies a female as male (20% or 0.2).
P(M|W) as the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem,

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Substituting the values,

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) = 0.413793103 (rounded to 11 decimal places)

Hence, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.413793103}
