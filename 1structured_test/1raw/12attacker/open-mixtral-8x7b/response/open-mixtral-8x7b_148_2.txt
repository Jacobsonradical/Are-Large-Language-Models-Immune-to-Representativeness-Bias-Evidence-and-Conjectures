To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as p(M), and the probability that the attacker is female as p(F). From the information given, p(M) + p(F) = 1.

From part (b), we know that 15% of the population is male, so p(M) = 0.15. Since p(F) = 1 - p(M), we have p(F) = 0.85.

Now, let's define two events:

* E1: The witness identifies the attacker as male.
* E2: The attacker is male.

Bayes' theorem states that:

p(E2|E1) = p(E1|E2) \* p(E2) / p(E1)

First, we need to calculate p(E1|E2), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, we have p(E1|E2) = 0.8.

Next, we need to calculate p(E1), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can happen in two ways:

* The attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies him as male (p(E1|E2) \* p(E2)).
* The attacker is female and the witness incorrectly identifies her as male (p(E1|F) \* p(F)).

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we have p(E1|F) = 0.2.

Putting it all together, we get:

p(E1) = p(E1|E2) \* p(E2) + p(E1|F) \* p(F) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

p(E2|E1) = p(E1|E2) \* p(E2) / p(E1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.345}
