To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (P(Male)), given the information about the city's population (P(City Population)) and the witness's identification (P(Witness|Male)).

First, let's denote P(Male) as p, P(City Population|Male) as f, and P(Witness|Male) as w. We want to find p, but Bayes' theorem tells us:

p = P(Male|Witness) = P(Witness|Male) * P(Male) / P(Witness)

We know P(City Population|Male) = f = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is male).
We know P(Witness|Male) = w = 0.80 (80% chance the witness correctly identifies a male as male).
We want to find P(Witness), which is given by:

P(Witness) = P(Witness|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness|Female) * P(Female)

We know P(Female) = 1 - P(Male) = 1 - f = 0.85 (85% of the city's population is female).
We also know that P(Witness|Female) = 1 - P(Witness|Male) = 0.20 (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).

Now, let's calculate P(Witness):

P(Witness) = w * f + (1 - w) * (1 - f)
P(Witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(Witness) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(Witness) = 0.29

Finally, let's calculate P(Male|Witness):

P(Male|Witness) = p = w * f / P(Witness)
p = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
p â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is approximately 0.345.
