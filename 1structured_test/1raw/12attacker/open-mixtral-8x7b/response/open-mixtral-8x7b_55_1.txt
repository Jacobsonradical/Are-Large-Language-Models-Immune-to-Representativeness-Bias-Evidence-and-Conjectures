To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as p(M), and the probability that the attacker is female as p(F). Since we have only two possibilities, p(F) = 1 - p(M).

According to the information provided, the witness identified the attacker as male, and the probability of this occurring is given by:
