To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is male" and "the witness identified the attacker as male."

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of A given B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

Let A be the event "the attacker is male" and B be the event "the witness identified the attacker as male."

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We can find P(B) using the law of total probability, which states that P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Substituting this back into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.
