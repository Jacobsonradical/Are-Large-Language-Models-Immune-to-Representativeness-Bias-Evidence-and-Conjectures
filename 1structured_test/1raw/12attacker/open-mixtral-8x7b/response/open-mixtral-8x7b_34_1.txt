To reason through this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W). 

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying a person as male, regardless of whether the person is actually male or female. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male, plus the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male.

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.345}
