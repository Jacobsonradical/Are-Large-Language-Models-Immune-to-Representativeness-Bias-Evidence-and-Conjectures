To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs about a hypothesis given some evidence.

First, let's denote:
- H: The attacker is male
- ~H: The attacker is female
- E: A witness identified the attacker as male

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate:
P(H|E) = P(E and H) / P(E)
= P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
â‰ˆ 0.2818

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the evidence, is approximately 0.2818 or 28.18%.
