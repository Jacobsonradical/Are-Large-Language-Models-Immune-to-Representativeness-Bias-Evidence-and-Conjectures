To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male
- F as the event that the attacker is female
- W as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are interested in finding P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement.

First, let's find the initial probabilities:
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Next, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying a male when the attacker is actually male, and identifying a female when the attacker is actually female:
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(¬W|M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female 20% of the time)

P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
P(¬W|F) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a female as female 80% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(M|W):
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
≈ 0.333

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.333}.
