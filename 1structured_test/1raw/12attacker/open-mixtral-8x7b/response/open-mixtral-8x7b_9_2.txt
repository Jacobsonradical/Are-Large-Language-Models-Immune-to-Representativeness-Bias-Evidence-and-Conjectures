To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

First, let's calculate the prior probability P(Male) that a random person from the city is male. According to the information given, 15% of the population is male. So, P(Male) = 0.15.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of the evidence (the witness identifying the attacker as male) under the assumption that the attacker is indeed male, P(Witness|Male), and under the assumption that the attacker is female, P(Witness|Female).

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male is 80%, so P(Witness|Male) = 0.8. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male is 20%, so P(Witness|Female) = 0.2 (since 100% - 80% error rate).

Finally, we need to apply Bayes' theorem:

P(Male|Witness) = [P(Witness|Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Witness|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness|Female) * P(Female)]

Substituting the values:

P(Male|Witness) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us approximately 0.2245 or 22.45% as the estimated probability that the attacker is male.
