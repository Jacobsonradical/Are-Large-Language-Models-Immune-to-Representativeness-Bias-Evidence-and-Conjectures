To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let event A be the attacker being male and event B be the witness identifying the attacker as male. We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified him as male.

From the question, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is female)

Applying Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
â‰ˆ 0.3165

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.3165 or 31.65%.
