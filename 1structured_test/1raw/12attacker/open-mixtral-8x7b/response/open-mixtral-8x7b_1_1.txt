To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first define our prior probability, likelihoods, and normalizing constant.

Prior probability (P(Male)) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
Likelihood (P(Witness said male | Attacker is male)) = 1 (since the witness identified the attacker as male)
Likelihood (P(Witness said male | Attacker is female)) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying males)

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

Posterior probability (P(Attacker is male | Witness said male)) = (P(Witness said male | Attacker is male) * Prior probability) / Normalizing constant

The normalizing constant is calculated as follows:
P(Witness said male | Attacker is male) * Prior probability + P(Witness said male | Attacker is female) * (1 - Prior probability)

Now let's calculate the posterior probability:

Posterior probability = (1 * 0.15) / (1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.4545

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.4545}
