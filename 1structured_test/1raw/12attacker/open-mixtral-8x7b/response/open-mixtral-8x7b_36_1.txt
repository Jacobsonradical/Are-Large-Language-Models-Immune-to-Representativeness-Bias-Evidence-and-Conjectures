To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the problem statement, we know P(A), the probability of an attacker being male in the city:
P(A) = 0.15

We also know that the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time:
P(B|A) =
