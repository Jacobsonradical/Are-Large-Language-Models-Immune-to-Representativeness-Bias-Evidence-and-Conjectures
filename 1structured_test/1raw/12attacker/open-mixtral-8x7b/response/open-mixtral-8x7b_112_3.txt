To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A and B be the events that the attacker is male and the witness identified the attacker as male, respectively. Then, Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider the probabilities of the witness identifying a male as male and a female as male:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identified the attacker as male, is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
