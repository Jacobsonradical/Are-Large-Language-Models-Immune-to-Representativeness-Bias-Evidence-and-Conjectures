To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A and B be the events that the attacker is male and the witness identified the attacker as male, respectively. Then, Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 1 (if the attacker is male, the witness will always identify him as male)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of cases when the person is female)

Now we need to calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This is the sum of the probabilities that the attacker is male and identified as male, and the probability that the attacker is female but identified as male:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.46875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.46875}
