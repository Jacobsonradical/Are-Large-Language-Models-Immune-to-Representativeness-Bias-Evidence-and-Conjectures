To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that "the attacker is male" and B be the event that "a witness identified the attacker as male."

From part (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's gender as male 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(not B|A) = 0.2.
