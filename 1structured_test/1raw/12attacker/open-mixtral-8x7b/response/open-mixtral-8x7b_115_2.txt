To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the hypotheses as follows:

H1: The attacker is male
H2: The attacker is female

We are given two pieces of evidence:

E1: A witness identified the attacker as male
E2: The city population is 85% female and 15% male

We are interested in calculating P(H1|E1 & E2), the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification and the city's population statistics.

First, we need to calculate some probabilities assuming H1 and H2 are equally likely, i.e., P(H1) = P(H2) = 0.5.

P(E1|H1) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified male)
P(E1|H2) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identified female as male)

Now, we need to calculate the probability of the attacker being male (H1) based on the city's population statistics:

P(H1 & E2) = P(H1) * P(E2|H1) = 0.5 * 0.15 = 0.075

Similarly, the probability of the attacker being female (H2) based on the city's population statistics is:

P(H2 & E2) = P(H2) * P(E2|H2) = 0.5 * 0.85 = 0.425

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of H1:

P(H1|E1 & E2) = [P(E1|H1) * P(H1 & E2)] / [P(E1|H1) * P(H1 & E2) + P(E1|H2) * P(H2 & E2)]
= (0.8 * 0.075) / ((0.8 * 0.075) + (0.2 * 0.425))
= 0.06 / (0.06 + 0.085)
= 0.06 / 0.145
â‰ˆ 0.414

Now, let's strictly answer the question in the requested format:

{probability: 0.414}
