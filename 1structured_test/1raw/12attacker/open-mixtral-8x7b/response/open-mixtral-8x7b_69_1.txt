To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event of the witness identifying the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From (a), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
From (b), P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider all possibilities that could lead to the observation B (the witness identifying the attacker as male). This includes both the true positive rate (the attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies him as such) and the false positive rate (the attacker is female but the witness mistakenly identifies her as male).

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.41}
