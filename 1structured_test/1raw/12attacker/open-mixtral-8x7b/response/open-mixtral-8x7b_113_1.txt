To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is male, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified him as male.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A). Since 15% of the population is male, the prior probability is:

P(A) = 0.15
