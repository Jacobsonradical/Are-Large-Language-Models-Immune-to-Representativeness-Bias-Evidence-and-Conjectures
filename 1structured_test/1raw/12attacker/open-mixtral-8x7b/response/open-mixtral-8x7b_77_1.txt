To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we can use it to find the probability that the attacker is male, given the information about the city's population and the witness's accuracy.

Let's define the following terms:
- P(M) is the probability that a random person in the city is male, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(F) is the probability that a random person in the city is female, which is 85% or 0.85.
- P(W|M) is the probability that the witness identifies a male as male, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(W|F) is the probability that the witness identifies a female as male, which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male. We can calculate it as follows:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

After calculating, we get:

P(M|W) = 0.36 or 36%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 36%.
