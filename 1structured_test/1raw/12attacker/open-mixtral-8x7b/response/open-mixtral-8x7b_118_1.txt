To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time. So, P(W|A) = 0.8.

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is male. So, P(A) = 0.15.

To calculate P(W), we need to consider two scenarios: the attacker is male and the attacker is female. 

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and not A)
= P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.345}.
