To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male based on the city's population)

To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities - that the attacker is male and that the attacker is female. So:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
      = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
      â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
