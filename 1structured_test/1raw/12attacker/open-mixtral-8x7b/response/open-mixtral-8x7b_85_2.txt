To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A and B be the events that the attacker is male and the witness identified the attacker as male, respectively. We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 1 (if the attacker is male, the witness will correctly identify him as male 100% of the time)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the correct and incorrect identifications by the witness. This involves the law of total probability, which states that P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.32

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (1 * 0.15) / 0.32
â‰ˆ 0.46875

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.46875}
