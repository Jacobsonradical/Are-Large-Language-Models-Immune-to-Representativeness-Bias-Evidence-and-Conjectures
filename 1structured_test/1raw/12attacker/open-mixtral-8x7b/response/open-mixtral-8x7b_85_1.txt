To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the two events are A (the attacker being male) and B (the witness identifying the attacker as male). 

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% male population)
P(B|A) = 1 (since if the attacker is male and the witness says so, then the witness is correct)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male regardless of the attacker's gender. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability of a male attacker and the probability of a female attacker, each identified as male by the witness:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
         = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
         = 1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
         = 0.15 + 0.17
         = 0.32

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
           = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32
           = 0.15 / 0.32
           = 0.46875

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the evidence is approximately 0.46875 or 46.875%.
