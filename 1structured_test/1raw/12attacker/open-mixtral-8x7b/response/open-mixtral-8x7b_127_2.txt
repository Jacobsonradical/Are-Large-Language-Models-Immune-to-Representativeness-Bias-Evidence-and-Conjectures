To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is male" and "the witness identified the attacker as male."

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker is male"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as male"

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
1. P(B|A): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. This is the accuracy of the witness, which is 80% or 0.8.
2. P(A): the prior probability that the attacker is male. This is what we want to find, but since the problem doesn't provide it directly, we can use the fact that 15% of the population is male to calculate it.
3. P(B): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This is what we want to find, but since the problem doesn't provide it directly, we can calculate it using the law of total probability.

To calculate P(A), the probability that the attacker is male, we can use the fact that 15% of the population is male:
P(A) = 0.15

To calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. To calculate P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male, we can use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time:
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

To calculate P(not A), the probability that the attacker is not male, we can use the fact that 85% of the population is female:
P(not A) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.84

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male, using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.84 = 0.136

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.136}
