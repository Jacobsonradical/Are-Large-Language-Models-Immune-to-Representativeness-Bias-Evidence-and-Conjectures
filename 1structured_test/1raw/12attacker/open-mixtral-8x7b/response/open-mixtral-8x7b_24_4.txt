To reason through this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A = Attacker is male
W = Witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the problem, we know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(W|A) = 1 (if the attacker is male, the witness will correctly identify him as male 100% of the time)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (20% chance the witness will mistakenly identify a female as male)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
= 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
= 0.15 / 0.32
≈ 0.46875

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.46875}
