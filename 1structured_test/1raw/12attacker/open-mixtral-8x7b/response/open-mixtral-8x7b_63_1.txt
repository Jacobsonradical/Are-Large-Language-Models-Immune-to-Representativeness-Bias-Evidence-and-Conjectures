To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) = probability the attacker is male
P(~A) = probability the attacker is female
P(W|A) = probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male
P(W|~A) = probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female
P(A) = P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(~A) = P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time when the person is male)
P(W|~A) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time when the person is female)

Now, let's apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A))

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.2817 (28.17%)

{probability: 0.2817}
