To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male,
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

According to the given information:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (the witness erroneously identified the attacker's gender 20% of the time, and since 50% of the population is female, the probability that the witness identifies a woman as a man is 0.2 * 0.5)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.085)
       = 0.12 / 0.205
       ≈ 0.585

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.585.
