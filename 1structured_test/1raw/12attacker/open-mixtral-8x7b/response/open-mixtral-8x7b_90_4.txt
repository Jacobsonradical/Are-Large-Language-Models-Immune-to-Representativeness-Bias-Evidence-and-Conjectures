To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a person is male in the city)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female as male)
P(not A) = 0.85 (probability that a person is female in the city)

We want: P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.4138}
