To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem statement, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male) and P(B|A) = 1 (if the attacker is male, the witness will always identify him as male).

To find P(B), we need to consider two cases: when the attacker is male (A) and when the attacker is female (A'). We have already found P(B|A) = 1, and we need to find P(B|A'). The witness errs 20% of the time when identifying the gender, so P(B|A') = 0.2.

Now, we need to find P(A'), the probability that the attacker is female. Since the population is 85% female, P(A') = 0.85.

Finally, we need to find P(B), which is the sum of probabilities of B when A and A' are true:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A') = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 1 * 0.15 / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.46875}
