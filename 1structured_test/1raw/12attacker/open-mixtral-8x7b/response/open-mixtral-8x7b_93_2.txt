To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given that a witness identified the attacker as male (B).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a male as male with 80% probability (P(B|A) = 0.8) and incorrectly identifies a female as male with 20% probability (P(B|not A) = 0.2).

From statement (b), we know that the prior probability of a person being male is 15% (P(A) = 0.15) and female is 85% (P(not A) = 0.85).

To find P(B), we need to calculate the total probability of a witness identifying someone as male. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of a male actually being male (true positive) and a female being incorrectly identified as male (false positive):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
