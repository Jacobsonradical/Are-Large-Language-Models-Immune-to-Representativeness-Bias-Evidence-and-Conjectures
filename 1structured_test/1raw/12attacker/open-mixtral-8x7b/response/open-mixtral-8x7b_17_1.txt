To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We know from the question:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is male and where the attacker is female:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, based on the given information, there's approximately a 41.38% chance that the attacker is male.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
