To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We are interested in calculating P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified him as male.

From the given information, we have:
1. P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is 0.8.
2. P(B|not A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 0.2.
3. P(not A): The probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85 (from the fact that 85% of the population is female).

Then, Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression gives us approximately 0.375 or 37.5%.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.375}
