To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) = probability that a random person in the city is male (15%)
P(F) = probability that a random person in the city is female (85%)
P(W|M) = probability that the witness identifies a male as male (80%)
P(W|F) = probability that the witness identifies a female as male (20%)

We want to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male, denoted as P(M|W).

Bayes' theorem states that P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)).

First, let's find P(W|M) * P(M) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12.

Next, let's find P(W|F) * P(F) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(M|W) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.4138 or 41.38% as a percentage.

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.4138}
