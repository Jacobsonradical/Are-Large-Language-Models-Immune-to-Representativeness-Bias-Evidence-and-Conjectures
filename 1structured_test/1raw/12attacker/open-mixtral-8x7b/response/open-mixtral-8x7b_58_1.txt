To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

From the information provided, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.413793103 (approximately)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.41}
