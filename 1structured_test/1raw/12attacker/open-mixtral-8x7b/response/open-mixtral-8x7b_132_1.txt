To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's gender as male 80% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.

From (b), we know that 15% of the population is male. So, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of identifying a male attacker (which we know is 0.8) and the probabilities of identifying a female attacker as male. The latter is the complement of the probability of correctly identifying a female, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. Since 85% of the population is female, this event has a probability of 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Therefore, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
        = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85
        = 0.12 + 0.142
        = 0.262

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.262
       = 0.12 / 0.262
       â‰ˆ 0.4572

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4572.
