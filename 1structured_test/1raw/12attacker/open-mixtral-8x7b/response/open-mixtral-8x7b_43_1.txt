To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is male and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know that:
- P(W|A) = 1 (since if the attacker is male, the witness will always identify him as male)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both the possibility that the attacker is male and the possibility that the attacker is female:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= 1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)
= 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 1 * 0.15 / 0.32
= 0.46875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.46875}
