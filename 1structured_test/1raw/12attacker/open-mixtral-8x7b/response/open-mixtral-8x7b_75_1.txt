To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that "the attacker is male" and B be the event that "a witness identified the attacker as male." We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

From the given information:
P(B|A) is the probability that a witness correctly identifies a male as male, which is 0.8 (80%).
P(A) is the probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (15%), since 15% of the city's population is male.
P(B|not A) is the probability that a witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 0.2 (20%).
P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not male, which is 0.85 (85%).

We need to find P(B), the probability of a witness identifying someone as male, regardless of whether the person is actually male or female. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(A) * P(B|A) + P(not A) * P(B|not A)
= (0.15) * (0.8) + (0.85) * (0.2)
= 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.32

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32
= 0.12 / 0.32
= 0.375

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.375}
