To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote the event that the attacker is male as A and the evidence as E (witness identifying the attacker as male).

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(E|not A) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 (the error rate when the witness identifies females as males)

We want to find P(not A), the probability that the attacker is female, which is 1 - P(A). 

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

We are interested in P(A|E), the probability that the attacker is male given the evidence. However, we don't have P(E), the probability of the evidence. But we can calculate the ratio of P(A|E) to P(not A|E).

This ratio is:
P(A|E) / P(not A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / [P(E|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|E) / P(not A|E) = (1 * 0.15) / (0.20 * 0.85)

Calculating this, we find:
P(A|E) / P(not A|E) ≈ 0.9412 / 0.3400 ≈ 2.768

Since this is a ratio, we can't directly get a probability from it. However, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is male by taking the ratio as a likelihood and dividing it by 1 plus the likelihood. This is a common technique when dealing with ratios of probabilities.

So, we calculate:
P(attacker is male) = 2.768 / (1 + 2.768) ≈ 0.7345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.7345.
