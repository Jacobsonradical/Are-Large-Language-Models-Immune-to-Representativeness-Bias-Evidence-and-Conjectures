To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male regardless of the attacker's gender. This can be calculated as follows:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
where A' is the event that the attacker is female and P(A') = 0.85

We also need P(W|A'), the probability of the witness identifying a female as male. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(W|A') = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get:

P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
