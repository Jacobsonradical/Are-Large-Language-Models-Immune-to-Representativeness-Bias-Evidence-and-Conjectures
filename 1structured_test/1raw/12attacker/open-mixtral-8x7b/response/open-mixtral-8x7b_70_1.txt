To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, the events are A (attacker is male) and B (witness identified the attacker as male).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given:
P(A), the probability that a person in the city is male: 0.15
P(B|A), the probability that a male would be identified as male: 0.8 (the witness's accuracy when the true gender is male)
P(B|A'), the probability that a female would be identified as male: 0.2 (the witness's error rate when the true gender is female)
P(A'), the probability that a person in the city is female: 0.85

However, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying a random person as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that they were identified as male by the witness:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
      = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
      = 0.12 / 0.29
      â‰ˆ 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.4138}
