To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. 

First, let's denote:
- M: event that the attacker is male
- F: event that the attacker is female
- W: event that the witness identified the attacker as male

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the city's population is female)
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is male)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male is 80%)
P(W|F) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male is 20%)

We want to find: P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Substituting the values:

P(M|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) = 0.413793103 (rounded to 11 decimal places)

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.413793103}
