To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker is male
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

We have two pieces of information that can help us find these probabilities:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male with 80% probability)
2. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)

However, we also need to know the probability of identifying a female as male, P(B|A'), where A' is the complementary event of A (the attacker being female). Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time and identifies a female as male in those cases, we have:

P(B|A') = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2

Now, to find P(A'), the probability that the attacker is female, we use the given information that 85% of the population is female:

P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now we can compute P(B), the probability of identifying the attacker as male regardless of the attacker's gender:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.16
P(B) = 0.28

Finally, we can compute P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.28
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.42857
