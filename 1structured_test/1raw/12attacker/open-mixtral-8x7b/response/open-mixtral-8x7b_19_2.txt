To reason through this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:
- P(A): The prior probability that a person in the city is male is 15% or 0.15.
- P(W|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male is 80% or 0.8.
- P(W): The probability of the witness's identification. This can be calculated as the sum of the products of the probabilities of each gender times the probability of identifying them correctly (or incorrectly). In mathematical terms, this is P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A'). Here, A' represents not A (or female), which has a probability of 0.85 based on the information provided, and P(W|A') is the probability of correctly identifying a female as female (which is also 0.8 based on the information provided).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85))

Calculating this gives us:
P(A|W) = 0.1053 or 10.53%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.1053}.
