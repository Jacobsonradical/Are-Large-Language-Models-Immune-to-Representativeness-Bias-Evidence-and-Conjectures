To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the information about the witness identification (B).

First, let's calculate P(B|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

Next, let's calculate P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male (female). This is given as 20% or 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases).

Now, we need to calculate P(A), the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the population statistics. And P(not A), the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 85% or 0.85.

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
