To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs after observing evidence.

First, let's denote:
- P(Male) as the probability that the attacker is male, which we want to estimate.
- P(Female) as the probability that the attacker is female, this is 1 - P(Male).
- P(Witness|Male) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male. This is 80% or 0.8.
- P(Witness|Female) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female. This is 20% or 0.2.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(Male|Witness) = [ P(Witness|Male) * P(Male) ] / [ P(Witness|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness|Female) * P(Female) ]

Given that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male:

P(Male) = 0.15
P(Female) = 0.85

So,

P(Male|Witness) = [ 0.8 * 0.15 ] / [ (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) ]
P(Male|Witness) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(Male|Witness) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(Male|Witness) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.4138}.
