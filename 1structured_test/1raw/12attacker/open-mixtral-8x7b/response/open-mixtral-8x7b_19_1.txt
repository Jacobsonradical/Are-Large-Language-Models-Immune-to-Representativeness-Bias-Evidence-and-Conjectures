To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.
We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified him as male.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time, and 50% of the population is female)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.085)
= 0.12 / 0.205
â‰ˆ 0.585

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.585.
