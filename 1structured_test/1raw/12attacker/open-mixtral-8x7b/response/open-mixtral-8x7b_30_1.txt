To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. 

Let's start with the initial belief, or prior probability, that the attacker is male (p(H)) based on the city's population:
p(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of the evidence (E) given that the attacker is male (p(E|H)) and given that the attacker is female (p(E|~H)). The evidence is the witness identification. According to the problem, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, this means that either the attacker is male and the witness was correct, or the attacker is female and the witness erred. Therefore,

p(E|H) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker as male)
p(E|~H) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male)

Now, we can calculate Bayes' theorem:

p(H|E) = [p(E|H) * p(H)] / [p(E|H) * p(H) + p(E|~H) * p(~H)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.413793103

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the evidence, is approximately 0.41.
