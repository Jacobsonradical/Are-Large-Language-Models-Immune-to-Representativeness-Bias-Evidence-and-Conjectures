To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is male
B: The witness identified the attacker as male

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% male population)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying anyone as male. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
