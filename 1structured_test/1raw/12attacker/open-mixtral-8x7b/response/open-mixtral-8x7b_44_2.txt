To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) = probability that a random person in the city is male (15%)
P(F) = probability that a random person in the city is female (85%)
P(W|M) = probability that the witness identifies a male as male (80%)
P(W|F) = probability that the witness identifies a female as male (20%, since there's a 20% chance they'll erroneously identify a female as male)

Now, we want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' theorem,

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Plug in the values:
P(M|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85))

Calculating the above expression, we get:
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.378

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.378}
