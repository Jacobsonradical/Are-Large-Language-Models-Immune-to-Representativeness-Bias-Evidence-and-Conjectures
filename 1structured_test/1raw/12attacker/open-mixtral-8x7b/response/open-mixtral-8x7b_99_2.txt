To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the attacker is male
- B: a witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

From the information, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (witness errs in identifying gender 20% of the time, and 50% of the population is female)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)]
≈ 0.5652

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.5652}
