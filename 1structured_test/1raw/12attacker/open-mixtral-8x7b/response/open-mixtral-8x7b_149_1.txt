To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:

- Event A: The attacker is male.
- Event B: A witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
P(A), the probability of an arbitrary person in the city being male, which is 0.15.
P(not A), the probability of an arbitrary person in the city being female, which is 0.85.
P(B|A), the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male as male, which is 0.8.
P(B|not A), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male, which is 0.2.

What we want to find is P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.413793103

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
