To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness's identification (W).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

From the problem, we know:
- P(A): 15% or 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is male)
- P(W|A): 80% or 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(not A): 85% or 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is female)
- P(W|not A): 20% or 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|W) = 0.413793103 (approximately)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41.
