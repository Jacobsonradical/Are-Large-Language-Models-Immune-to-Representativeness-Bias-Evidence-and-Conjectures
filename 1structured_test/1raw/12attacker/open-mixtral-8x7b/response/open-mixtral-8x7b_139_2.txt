To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the event that the attacker is male
- B: the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the problem, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

To find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.345}
