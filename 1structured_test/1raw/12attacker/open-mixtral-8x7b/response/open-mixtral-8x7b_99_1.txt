To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, let's find P(A), the probability that the attacker is male according to the city's population. This is given as 15% or 0.15.

Next, let's find P(B|A), the probability that a male would be identified as male by the witness. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

However, we also need to find P(B|not A), the probability that a female would be identified as male by the witness. This is given as 20% or 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies someone as male, regardless of their actual gender, using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male, using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.345.
