To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- A: the attacker is male
- B: a witness identified the attacker as male

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male.

First, let's calculate P(A), the prior probability that a random attacker in the city is male:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15

Next, we need to calculate P(B|A), the probability that a male attacker would be identified as male by the witness:
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8

We also need to calculate P(B|not A), the probability that a female attacker would be identified as male by the witness. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time and identifies a female as male, we have:
P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2

Finally, we need to calculate P(B), the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as male regardless of the attacker's gender:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(not A) * P(B|not A)
P(B) = (0.15) * (0.8) + (0.85) * (0.2)
P(B) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the posterior probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.32)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.375

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.375}
