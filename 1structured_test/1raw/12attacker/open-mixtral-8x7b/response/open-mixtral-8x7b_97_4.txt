To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) = Probability that a random person in the city is male (15% or 0.15)
P(F) = Probability that a random person in the city is female (85% or 0.85)
P(W|M) = Probability that a witness identifies a male as male (80% or 0.8)
P(W|F) = Probability that a witness identifies a female as male (20% or 0.2)
P(M|W) = Probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identification

We want to find P(M|W):

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Now, let's compute the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.2818

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.2818 or 28.18%.
