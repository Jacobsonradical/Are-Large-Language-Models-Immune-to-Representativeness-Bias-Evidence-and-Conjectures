To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(M) as the prior probability that a person is male in the city, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(F) as the prior probability that a person is female in the city, which is 85% or 0.85.

P(W|M) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(W|F) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 20% or 0.2.

P(M|W) as the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values, we have:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

After calculating, we get:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.33

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.33}.
