To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are the attacker being male (A) and the witness identifying the attacker as male (B). We are interested in finding the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified him as such, P(A|B).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We know:
P(A): Probability of an arbitrary attacker being male = 0.15 (15%)
P(not A): Probability of an arbitrary attacker being female = 0.85 (85%)

Given the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A):
P(B|A) = Probability of witness identifying male attacker as male = 0.8

Given the witness errs 20% when the person is female, P(B|not A):
P(B|not A) = Probability of witness identifying female attacker as male = 0.2

Now we can calculate:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
