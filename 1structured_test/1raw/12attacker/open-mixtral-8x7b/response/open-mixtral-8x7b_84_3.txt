To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male (A) given the witness identified the attacker as male (W).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the given information, we have:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a person is male in the city)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider the two possible scenarios: the attacker is male or female. We can use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
where A' represents the event that the attacker is female, and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now, we need to calculate P(W|A'). Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying a female as male:
P(W|A') = 0.2

So, P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.35) = 0.0933 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.2667

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.2667, or approximately 26.67%}.
