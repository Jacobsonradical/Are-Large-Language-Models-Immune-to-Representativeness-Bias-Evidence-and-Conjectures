To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is male and W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. Then, we want to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male.

We have the following probabilities:
- P(A): the prior probability that the attacker is male; since 15% of the population is male, we have P(A) = 0.15
- P(W|A): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male; since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we have P(W|A) = 0.8
- P(W|¬A): the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is not male; since the witness errs 20% of the time, we have P(W|¬A) = 0.2
- P(¬A): the prior probability that the attacker is not male; since 85% of the population is female, we have P(¬A) = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
≈ 0.333

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.333}
