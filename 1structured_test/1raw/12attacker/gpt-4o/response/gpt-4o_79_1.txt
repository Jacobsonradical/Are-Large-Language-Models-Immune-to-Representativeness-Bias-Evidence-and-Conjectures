To solve this problem, we'll apply Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( M \): The event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \): The event that the attacker is female.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is male.
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is female.
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female.

We need to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Calculating \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(M|W) \):
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is about 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:

{ "probability": 0.4138 }
