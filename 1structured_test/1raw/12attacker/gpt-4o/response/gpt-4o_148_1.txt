To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:

- \( P(A \mid B) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.
- \( P(B \mid A) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male.
- \( P(A) \) is the priori probability that the attacker is male (based on population statistics).
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of a witness identifying the attacker as male regardless of the actual gender.

Let's break this down:

1. **P(A)**: The probability that the attacker is male based on the city's population statistics.
   \[ P(A) = 0.15 \]

2. **P(B \mid A)**: The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is male.
   \[ P(B \mid A) = 0.80 \]

3. **P(B \mid \neg A)**: The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given the attacker is female.
   \[ P(B \mid \neg A) = 0.20 \]
   where \( \neg A \) denotes that the attacker is female.

4. **P(\neg A)**: The probability that the attacker is female based on the city's population statistics.
   \[ P(\neg A) = 0.85 \]

Now, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B \mid A) P(A) + P(B \mid \neg A) P(\neg A) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately \(0.414\).
