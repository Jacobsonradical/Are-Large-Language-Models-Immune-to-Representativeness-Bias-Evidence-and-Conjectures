To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let:
- \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male.
- \( W \) be the event that the attacker is female.
- \( E \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find \( P(M | E) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(M | E) = \frac{P(E | M) \times P(M)}{P(E)} \]

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (probability that a random person in the city is male)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \) (probability that a random person in the city is female)
- \( P(E | M) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- \( P(E | W) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

First, we need to calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

\[ P(E) = P(E | M) \times P(M) + P(E | W) \times P(W) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(M | E) \).

\[ P(M | E) = \frac{P(E | M) \times P(M)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(M | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

Thus, the answer is:
