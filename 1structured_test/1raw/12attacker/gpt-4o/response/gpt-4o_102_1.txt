We can use Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identification and the prior distribution of genders in the city.

Let:
- \(M\) be the event that the attacker is male.
- \(W_M\) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
- \(P(M) = 0.15\), the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \(P(\neg M) = 0.85\), the prior probability that the attacker is female.
- \(P(W_M | M) = 0.80\), the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male.
- \(P(W_M | \neg M) = 0.20\), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.

We need to find \(P(M | W_M)\), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M | W_M) = \frac{P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)}
\]

First, we need to find \(P(W_M)\), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

\[
P(W_M) = P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_M | \neg M) \cdot P(\neg M)
\]
\[
P(W_M) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85
\]
\[
P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41.

\[
\{probability: 0.41\}
\]
