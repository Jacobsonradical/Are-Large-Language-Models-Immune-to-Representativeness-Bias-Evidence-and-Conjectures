To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( P(M) \) be the prior probability that a randomly selected person is male.
- \( P(F) \) be the prior probability that a randomly selected person is female.
- \( P(W | M) \) be the probability that the witness says the attacker is male given that the attacker is indeed male.
- \( P(W | F) \) be the probability that the witness says the attacker is male given that the attacker is actually female.
- \( P(M | W) \) be the posterior probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male, which is what we want to find out.

From the given data:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \)

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(W) \), the overall probability that the witness says the attacker is male. We do this using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can update our belief using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414.
