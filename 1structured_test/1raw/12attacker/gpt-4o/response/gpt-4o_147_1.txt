To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W_{male} \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
- \( P(W_{male} | M) = 0.8 \) (Witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_{male} | F) = 0.2 \) (Witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We are interested in \( P(M | W_{male}) \), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(M | W_{male}) = \frac{P(W_{male} | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_{male})} \]

Where \( P(W_{male}) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(W_{male}) = P(W_{male} | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_{male} | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitute the given probabilities:

\[ P(W_{male}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_{male}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_{male}) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute \( P(W_{male}) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W_{male}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_{male}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_{male}) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

\[ \{probability: 0.414\} \]
