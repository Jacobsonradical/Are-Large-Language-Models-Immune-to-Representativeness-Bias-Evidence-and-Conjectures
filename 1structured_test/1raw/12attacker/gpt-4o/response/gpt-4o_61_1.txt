To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
- \( P(M) \), the prior probability that the attacker is male, is 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(F) \), the prior probability that the attacker is female, is 0.85 (85%).
- \( P(W \mid M) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, is 0.80 (80%).
- \( P(W \mid F) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, is 0.20 (20%).

We want to find \( P(M \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.4138.

So the final answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
