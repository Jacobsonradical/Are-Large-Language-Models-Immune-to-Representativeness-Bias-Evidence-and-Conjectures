To estimate the probability that the attacker is male based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that any random person in the city is male.
- \( P(A) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies any given attacker as male.

Given the information provided:
- A witness identifies the attacker as male (\( A \)).
- The probability that a witness correctly identifies a male attacker as male is \( P(A|B) = 0.8 \).
- The prior probability of a person being male in the city is \( P(B) = 0.15 \).

We also need \( P(A) \), the probability that the witness identifies any given person as male. This can be calculated as:

\[ P(A) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B) + P(A|\neg B) \cdot P(\neg B) \]

Where:
- \( P(A|\neg B) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(\neg B) \) is the prior probability of a person in the city being female, which is \( 0.85 \).

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(A) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(A) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(A) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|A) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification under the conditions described, is approximately 0.414.
