To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

We have:
- \( P(W) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies gender)
- \( P(E) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies gender)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability that a random person is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability that a random person is female)

We want to calculate \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Here:
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies a male correctly, which is 0.80.
- \( P(M) \) is 0.15.

To get \( P(W) \), the overall probability that the witness says the attacker is male, we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W|F) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 0.20.
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \).

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.414}
