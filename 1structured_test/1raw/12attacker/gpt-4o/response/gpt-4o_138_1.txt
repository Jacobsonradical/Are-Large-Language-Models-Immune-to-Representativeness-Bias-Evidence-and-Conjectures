To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem relates the conditional probabilities of events based on prior knowledge and new information.

Let:
- \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \) be the event that the attacker is female.
- \( W_m \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M \mid W_m) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(M \mid W_m) = \frac{P(W_m \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)} \]

First, let's break down each term:

1. \( P(M) \) and \( P(F) \) are the prior probabilities based on the population distribution:
\[ P(M) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(F) = 0.85 \]

2. \( P(W_m \mid M) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male:
\[ P(W_m \mid M) = 0.80 \]

3. \( P(W_m \mid F) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female:
\[ P(W_m \mid F) = 0.20 \]

4. \( P(W_m) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_m) = P(W_m \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_m \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W_m) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.29 \]

Now, plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M \mid W_m) = \frac{P(W_m \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_m) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_m) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_m) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
