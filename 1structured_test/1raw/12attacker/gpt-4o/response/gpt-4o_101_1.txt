To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is male.
- \( B \): The witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is male, given 15% of the population is male).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is female, \( \neg A \)).
- \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker).
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male).

We need to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as male.

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414.
