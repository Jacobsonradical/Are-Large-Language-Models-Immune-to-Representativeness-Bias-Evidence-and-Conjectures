To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the following events:
- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

We have:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is female)
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male)
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female)

To compute \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
