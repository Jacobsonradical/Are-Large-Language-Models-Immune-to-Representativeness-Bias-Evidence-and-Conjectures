To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- \( P(\text{Male}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \)
- The witness has an accuracy rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

We need to compute the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, let's define:
- \( T_M \) = Witness testifies that the person is male
- \( M \) = The person is actually male
- \( F \) = The person is actually female

We need to find \( P(M|T_M) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|T_M) = \frac{P(T_M|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(T_M)} \]

Where:
\[ P(T_M) = P(T_M|M) \cdot P(M) + P(T_M|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Given the accuracy rates:
\[ P(T_M|M) = 0.80 \]
\[ P(T_M|F) = 0.20 \]

Now we substitute these values:
\[ P(T_M) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(T_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(T_M) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(M|T_M) \):
\[ P(M|T_M) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|T_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|T_M) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

Thus, the answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
