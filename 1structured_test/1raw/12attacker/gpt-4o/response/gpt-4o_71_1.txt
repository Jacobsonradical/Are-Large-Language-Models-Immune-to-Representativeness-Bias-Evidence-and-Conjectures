To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \) as the event that the attacker is female.
- \( W_M \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_M|M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifying a male)
- \( P(W_M|F) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

We want to find \( P(M|W_M) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M|W_M) = \frac{P(W_M|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]

Where \( P(W_M) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_M) = P(W_M|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_M|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Let's calculate \( P(W_M) \):

\[ P(W_M) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_M) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(M|W_M) \):

\[ P(M|W_M) = \frac{P(W_M|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]
\[ P(M|W_M) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W_M) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately \( 0.4138 \).

So, the final answer is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
