To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( M \): The event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \): The event that the attacker is female.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to calculate \( P(M \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

From the information given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is male based on the population statistics).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is female based on the population statistics).
- \( P(W \mid M) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male).
- \( P(W \mid F) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(M \mid W) \):

\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:

\[
P(W) = P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W \mid F) \cdot P(F)
\]

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(M \mid W) \):

\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(M \mid W) \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
