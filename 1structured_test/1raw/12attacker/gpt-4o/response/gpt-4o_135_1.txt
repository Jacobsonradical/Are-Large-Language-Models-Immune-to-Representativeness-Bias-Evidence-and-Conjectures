To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information we have, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(M) \) as the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) \) as the prior probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W|M) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(W|F) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female.
- \( P(M|W) \) as the posterior probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Given:

- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female).
- \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|F) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

To find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F)
\]

Now, let's plug in the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can find \( P(M|W) \):

\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

\[
{probability: 0.414}
\]
