To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The relevant probabilities we need to consider are:

- \( P(M) \): The prior probability that an attacker is male.
- \( P(F) \): The prior probability that an attacker is female.
- \( P(W | M) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(W | F) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female.
- \( P(W) \): The overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identification is approximately 0.4138.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]
