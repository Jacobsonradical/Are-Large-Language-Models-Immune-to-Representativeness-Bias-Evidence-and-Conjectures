To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male and \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. According to the problem, this is 80%, or 0.8.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male. According to the population statistics, this is 15%, or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

To find \( P(W) \), we need to consider both scenarios: the attacker is male and the attacker is female.

- The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female (\( P(W|F) \)) is the error rate, which is 20%, or 0.2.
- The probability that the attacker is female (\( P(F) \)) is 85%, or 0.85.

Thus,
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately \(0.4138\).
