To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process to solve the problem:

1. **Define the probabilities:**
   - \( P(M) \): Probability that an attacker is male = 0.15
   - \( P(F) \): Probability that an attacker is female = 0.85
   - \( P(W|M) \): Probability that a witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male = 0.80
   - \( P(W|F) \): Probability that a witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female = 0.20

2. **Calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies a male:**
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.29
   \]

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)}
   \]
   \[
   P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(M|W) \approx 0.4138
   \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
