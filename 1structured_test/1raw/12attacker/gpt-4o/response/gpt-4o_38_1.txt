To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \) as the event that the attacker is female.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (probability that a random person in the city is male).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (probability that a random person in the city is female).
- \( P(W \mid M) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male).
- \( P(W \mid F) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).

We want to find \( P(M \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) P(M)}{P(W)} 
\]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:

\[ 
P(W) = P(W \mid M) P(M) + P(W \mid F) P(F) 
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[ 
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) 
     = 0.12 + 0.17 
     = 0.29 
\]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} 
            = \frac{0.12}{0.29} 
            \approx 0.4138 
\]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
