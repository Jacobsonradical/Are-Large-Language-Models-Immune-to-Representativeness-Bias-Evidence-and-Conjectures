To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here are the details:

- Let \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male.
- Let \( W_M \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We know:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (prior probability an attacker is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (prior probability an attacker is female)
- \( P(W_M | M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies a male attacker)
- \( P(W_M | F) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male)

We need to find \( P(M | W_M) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(M | W_M) = \frac{P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(W_M) \):

\[
P(W_M) = P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_M | F) \cdot P(F)
\]

Substitute the given probabilities:

\[
P(W_M) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately:

\[
{probability: 0.414}
\]
