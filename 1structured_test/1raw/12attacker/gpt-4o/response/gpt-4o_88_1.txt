To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the demographics of the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as male.

From the information provided:
- The probability of selecting a male in the city population, \( P(M) \), is 0.15.
- The probability of selecting a female in the city population, \( P(F) \), is 0.85.
- The probability that the witness identifies a male correctly, \( P(W|M) \), is 0.80.
- The probability that the witness identifies a female as male (error), \( P(W|F) \), is 0.20.

We need to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the person as male. This can be calculated as:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we can update Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the demographics is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
