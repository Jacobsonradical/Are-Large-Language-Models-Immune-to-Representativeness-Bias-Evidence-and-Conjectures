To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \(M\): The attacker is male.
- \(F\): The attacker is female.
- \(W\): The witness identified the attacker as male.

We aim to find \(P(M|W)\), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

We need to calculate each component:

1. **Prior probability of the attacker being male, \(P(M)\)**:
\[ P(M) = 0.15 \] 

2. **Prior probability of the attacker being female, \(P(F)\)**:
\[ P(F) = 0.85 \] 

3. **Likelihood of the witness identifying a male if the attacker is male, \(P(W|M)\)**:
\[ P(W|M) = 0.80 \] 

4. **Likelihood of the witness identifying a male if the attacker is female, \(P(W|F)\)**:
\[ P(W|F) = 0.20 \] 

Next, we calculate \(P(W)\), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:
\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]
