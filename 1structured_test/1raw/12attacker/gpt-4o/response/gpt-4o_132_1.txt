To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification under the conditions described, we can use Bayes' Theorem. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(Male|W) = \frac{P(W|Male) \cdot P(Male)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(Male|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.
- \( P(W|Male) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male.
- \( P(Male) \) is the prior probability that any given person in the population is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the problem statement:
- \( P(W|Male) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male).
- \( P(Female|Male) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female, but we need it for consistency in calculations later).
- \( P(Male) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that any person in the city is male).

To find \( P(W) \), we need to consider both possibilities (the attacker is male or female):
\[ P(W) = P(W|Male) \cdot P(Male) + P(W|Female) \cdot P(Female) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|Female) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).
- \( P(Female) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that any person in the city is female).

Substituting the values we have:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(Male|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(Male|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(Male|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male is approximately 0.4138.

Hence, the answer is: 
\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
