To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that the attacker is male is 15%.
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that the attacker is female is 85%.
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male is 80%.
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male is 20%.

We want to find the posterior probability \( P(M|W) \) that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as male, calculated as follows:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(M|W) \):

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
