To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probability of an event to prior probabilities and likelihoods. Let's denote:

- \( P(M) \) as the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) \) as the prior probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W|M) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(W|F) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female.
- \( P(M|W) \) as the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Based on the information given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \)

We need to find \( P(M|W) \), using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F)} \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]

Calculating the numerator:
\[ 0.80 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \]

Calculating the denominator:
\[ 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, calculating the final probability:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414.
