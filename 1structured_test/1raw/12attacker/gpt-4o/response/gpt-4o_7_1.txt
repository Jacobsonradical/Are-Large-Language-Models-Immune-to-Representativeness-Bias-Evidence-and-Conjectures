To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following:

- \( P(M) \): Probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) \): Probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W|M) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given he is male.
- \( P(W|F) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given she is female.
- \( P(W) \): Overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \)

We need to calculate \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, we find \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
