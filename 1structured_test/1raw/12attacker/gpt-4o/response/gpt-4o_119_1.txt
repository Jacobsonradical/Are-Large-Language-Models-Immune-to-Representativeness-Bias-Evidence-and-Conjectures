To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as such, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

The given information can be translated into conditional probabilities as follows:
- \( P(Witness_says_male | Male) = 0.8 \) 
- \( P(Witness_says_male | Female) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(Male) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(Female) = 0.85 \)

We are looking to find \( P(Male | Witness_says_male) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(Male | Witness_says_male) = \frac{P(Witness_says_male | Male) \times P(Male)}{P(Witness_says_male)} 
\]

To find \( P(Witness_says_male) \), we can use the law of total probability:
\[ 
P(Witness_says_male) = P(Witness_says_male | Male) \times P(Male) + P(Witness_says_male | Female) \times P(Female)
\]
\[ 
= (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) 
\]
\[ 
= 0.12 + 0.17 
\]
\[ 
= 0.29
\]

Now, substituting the values back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(Male | Witness_says_male) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} 
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[ 
\approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is: 
{
  probability: 0.4138
}
