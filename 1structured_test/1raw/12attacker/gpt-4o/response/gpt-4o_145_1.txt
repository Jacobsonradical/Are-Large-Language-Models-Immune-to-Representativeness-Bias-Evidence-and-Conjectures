To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(M) \): The probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) \): The probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W|M) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W|F) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information provided:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
- \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \) (Witness correctly identifies gender as male 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.2 \) (Witness incorrectly identifies gender as male 20% of the time)

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's actual gender. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414.
