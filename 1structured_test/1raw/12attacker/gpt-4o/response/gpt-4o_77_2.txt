To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This process requires us to calculate \( P(\text{male} \mid \text{identified as male}) \).

Given:
- \( P(\text{male}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\text{female}) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(\text{identified as male} \mid \text{male}) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\text{identified as male} \mid \text{female}) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(\text{male} \mid \text{identified as male}) \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{male} \mid \text{identified as male}) = \frac{P(\text{identified as male} \mid \text{male}) \cdot P(\text{male})}{P(\text{identified as male})} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(\text{identified as male}) \):
\[ P(\text{identified as male}) = P(\text{identified as male} \mid \text{male}) \cdot P(\text{male}) + P(\text{identified as male} \mid \text{female}) \cdot P(\text{female}) \]
\[ P(\text{identified as male}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{identified as male}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{identified as male}) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(\text{male} \mid \text{identified as male}) \):
\[ P(\text{male} \mid \text{identified as male}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{male} \mid \text{identified as male}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{male} \mid \text{identified as male}) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
