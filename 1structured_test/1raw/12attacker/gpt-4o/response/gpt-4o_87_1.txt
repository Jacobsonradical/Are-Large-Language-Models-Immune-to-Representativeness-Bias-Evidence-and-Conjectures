To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the information:

- The witness identifies an attacker as male.
- The witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying gender.
- The population of the city is 85% female and 15% male.

We define the following events:
- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male (80% or 0.80).
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that an attacker is male in the city (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

To find \( P(W) \), we consider two scenarios:
1. The attacker is male.
2. The attacker is female.

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|F) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female (20% or 0.20, because the witness is wrong 20% of the time).
- \( P(F) \) is the prior probability that an attacker is female in the city (85% or 0.85).

Now we calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can plug \( P(W) \), \( P(W|M) \), and \( P(M) \) back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
