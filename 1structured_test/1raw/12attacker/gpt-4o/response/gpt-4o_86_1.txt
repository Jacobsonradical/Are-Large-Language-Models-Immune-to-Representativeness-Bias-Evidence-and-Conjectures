To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Probability that a person chosen at random in the city is male (\( P(M) \)) = 0.15
   - Probability that a person chosen at random in the city is female (\( P(F) \)) = 0.85

2. **Conditional Probabilities:**
   - Probability that the witness correctly identifies a male given that the person is male (\( P(W = \text{male} | M) \)) = 0.8
   - Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male given that the person is female (\( P(W = \text{male} | F) \)) = 0.2

3. **Using Bayes' Theorem:**
   - We need to find \( P(M | W = \text{male}) \):
     \[
     P(M | W = \text{male}) = \frac{P(W = \text{male} | M) P(M)}{P(W = \text{male})}
     \]

4. **Finding \( P(W = \text{male}) \):**
   - This is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:
     \[
     P(W = \text{male}) = P(W = \text{male} | M) P(M) + P(W = \text{male} | F) P(F)
     \]
     \[
     P(W = \text{male}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
     \]
     \[
     P(W = \text{male}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
     \]

5. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
     \[
     P(M | W = \text{male}) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29}
     \]
     \[
     P(M | W = \text{male}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
     \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately \( 0.4138 \).
