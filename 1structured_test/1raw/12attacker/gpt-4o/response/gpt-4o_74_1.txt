To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how the calculation is structured:

- Let \( M \) represent the event that the attacker is male.
- Let \( F \) represent the event that the attacker is female.
- Let \( W \) represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We are given:
- The probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identification of the attacker as male: \( P(M|W) \).
- Probability of the attacker being male: \( P(M) = 0.15 \).
- Probability of the attacker being female: \( P(F) = 0.85 \).
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male: \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \).
- Probability that the witness misidentifies a female as male: \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(M|W) \):

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately \( 0.414 \).
