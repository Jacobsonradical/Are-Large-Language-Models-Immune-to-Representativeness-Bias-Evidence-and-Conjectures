To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define the terms:

- \( M \): the attacker is male
- \( F \): the attacker is female
- \( W_{\text{correct}} \): the witness correctly identifies the gender
- \( W_{\text{incorrect}} \): the witness incorrectly identifies the gender

We want to compute \( P(M \mid W_{\text{identified as male}}) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   \[ P(M) = 0.15 \]
   \[ P(F) = 0.85 \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   \[ P(W_{\text{identified as male}} \mid M) = 0.80 \, (\text{since the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time}) \]
   \[ P(W_{\text{identified as male}} \mid F) = 0.20 \, (\text{since the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time}) \]

3. **Total probability** of the evidence (witness identifying the attacker as male):
   \[ P(W_{\text{identified as male}}) = P(W_{\text{identified as male}} \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_{\text{identified as male}} \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]
   \[ P(W_{\text{identified as male}}) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
   \[ P(W_{\text{identified as male}}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
   \[ P(W_{\text{identified as male}}) = 0.29 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[ P(M \mid W_{\text{identified as male}}) = \frac{P(W_{\text{identified as male}} \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_{\text{identified as male}})} \]
   \[ P(M \mid W_{\text{identified as male}}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(M \mid W_{\text{identified as male}}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(M \mid W_{\text{identified as male}}) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately \( 0.414 \).
