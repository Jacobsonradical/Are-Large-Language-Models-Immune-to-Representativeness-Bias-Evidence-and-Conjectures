To determine the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( P(\text{Male}) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that a random person in the city is male.
- \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that a random person in the city is female.
- \( P(E|\text{Male}) = 0.8 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male.
- \( P(E|\text{Female}) = 0.2 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male (since they have an 80% accuracy rate, they make mistakes 20% of the time).

We are interested in \( P(\text{Male}|E) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(\text{Male}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Male}) \cdot P(\text{Male})}{P(E)}
\]

First, we need to calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as male. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|\text{Male}) \cdot P(\text{Male}) + P(E|\text{Female}) \cdot P(\text{Female})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(\text{Male}|E) = \frac{P(E|\text{Male}) \cdot P(\text{Male})}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

\{probability: 0.4138\}
