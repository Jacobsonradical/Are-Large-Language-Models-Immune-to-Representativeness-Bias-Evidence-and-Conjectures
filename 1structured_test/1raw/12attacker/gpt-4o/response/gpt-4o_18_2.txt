To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the given information about the city's population, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate of an event based on new evidence.

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that any randomly selected person in the city is male.
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that any randomly selected person in the city is female.
- The witness's accuracy rates: \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male) and \( P(W|F) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a female as female).
- The error rates: \( P(W|M') = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female) and \( P(W|F') = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).

We want to determine \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F') \cdot P(F)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W|F') = 0.2 \)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately \( 0.4138 \).
