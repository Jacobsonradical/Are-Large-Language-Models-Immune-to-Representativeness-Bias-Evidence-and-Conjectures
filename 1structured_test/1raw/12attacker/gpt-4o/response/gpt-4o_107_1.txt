This problem requires applying Bayes' Theorem to find the probability that the attacker is male given that a witness identified the attacker as male. Here's the process to find the solution:

1. Define the relevant probabilities:
   - \( P(M) \): Probability that the attacker is male.
   - \( P(F) \): Probability that the attacker is female.
   - \( P(W|M) \): Probability that the witness says the attacker is male given the attacker is indeed male.
   - \( P(W|F) \): Probability that the witness says the attacker is male given the attacker is actually female.
   - \( P(W) \): Probability that the witness says the attacker is male.

2. From the problem:
   - \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
   - \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
   - \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies male attackers 80% of the time)
   - \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies female attackers as male 20% of the time)

3. Bayes' Theorem formula:
   \[
   P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)}
   \]

4. Compute \( P(W) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.29
   \]

5. Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(M|W) \approx 0.4138
   \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
