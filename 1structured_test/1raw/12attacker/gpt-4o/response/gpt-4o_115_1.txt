To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the evidence provided, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen person is male.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male if the attacker is indeed male.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability that the witness identifies someone as male.

Given the information:

1. \( P(\text{Male}) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
2. \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
3. \( P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Male}) = 0.80 \)
4. \( P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Female}) = 0.20 \)

First, we need to calculate \( P(\text{Witness says Male}) \). This can be determined using the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Male})P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Female})P(\text{Female}) \]

Plug in the values:

\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Male}) P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Witness says Male})} \]

\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately \( 0.414 \).
