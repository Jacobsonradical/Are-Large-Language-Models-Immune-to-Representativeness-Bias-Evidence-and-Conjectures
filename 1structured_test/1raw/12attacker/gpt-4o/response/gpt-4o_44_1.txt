To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the demographic information of the city's population, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

The given information can be formalized as follows:

- \( P(M) = 0.15 \): Prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \): Prior probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(\text{witness says male} \mid M) = 0.80 \): Probability the witness correctly identifies a male attacker.
- \( P(\text{witness says male} \mid F) = 0.20 \): Probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M \mid \text{witness says male}) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M \mid \text{witness says male}) = \frac{P(\text{witness says male} \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(\text{witness says male})} \]

Where \( P(\text{witness says male}) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{witness says male}) = P(\text{witness says male} \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(\text{witness says male} \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]

So:

\[ P(\text{witness says male}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{witness says male}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{witness says male}) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute this back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M \mid \text{witness says male}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid \text{witness says male}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid \text{witness says male}) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
