To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's identification of the attacker as male.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(M) \) = Probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) \) = Probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W_m | M) \) = Probability that the witness says the attacker is male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W_m | F) \) = Probability that the witness says the attacker is male given that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W_m) \) = Overall probability that the witness says the attacker is male.

From the information given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is female)
- \( P(W_m | M) = 0.80 \) (80% accuracy when the person is male)
- \( P(W_m | F) = 0.20 \) (20% error rate when the person is female)

We want to find \( P(M | W_m) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W_m) \), the total probability that the witness says the attacker is male. This can be done using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_m) = P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_m | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(W_m) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(M | W_m) \):

\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_m) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414.
