To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W : \text{The witness identifies the attacker as male.} \)

From the given information:

- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a random person is male).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a random person is female).
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time).
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time).

We want to find \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitute in the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substitute \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
