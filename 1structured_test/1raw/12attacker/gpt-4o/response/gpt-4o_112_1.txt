We can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city. 

The steps are:

1. Define the events:
   - \(M\): The attacker is male.
   - \(F\): The attacker is female.
   - \(W\): The witness identified the attacker as male.

2. The information:
   - \(P(M) = 0.15\) (Prior probability that the attacker is male).
   - \(P(F) = 0.85\) (Prior probability that the attacker is female).
   - \(P(W|M) = 0.8\) (Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is male).
   - \(P(W|F) = 0.2\) (Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is female).

3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where \(P(W)\) can be found using the total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.414}
