This problem can be approached using Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is male given the witnessâ€™s identification.

Let \( M \) represent the event that the attacker is male, and \( F \) represent the event that the attacker is female.

Given:
1. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8, i.e., \( P(\text{witness says male} \mid M) = 0.8 \).
2. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a male (when it is actually a female) is 0.2, i.e., \( P(\text{witness says male} \mid F) = 0.2 \).
3. The prior probabilities from the population distribution are \( P(M) = 0.15 \) and \( P(F) = 0.85 \).

We need to compute \( P(M \mid \text{witness says male}) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(M \mid \text{witness says male}) = \frac{P(\text{witness says male} \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(\text{witness says male})}
\]

First, we calculate \( P(\text{witness says male}) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(\text{witness says male}) = P(\text{witness says male} \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(\text{witness says male} \mid F) \cdot P(F)
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
P(\text{witness says male}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(M \mid \text{witness says male}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \}
\]
