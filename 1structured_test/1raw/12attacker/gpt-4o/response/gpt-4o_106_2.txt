To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We'll denote:

- \(P(M)\): Probability that the attacker is male
- \(P(F)\): Probability that the attacker is female
- \(P(W|M)\): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male
- \(P(W|F)\): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female
- \(P(W)\): Overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We have:
- \(P(M) = 0.15\)
- \(P(F) = 0.85\)
- \(P(W|M) = 0.80\)
- \(P(W|F) = 0.20\)

We need to compute \(P(M|W)\), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to compute \(P(W)\), the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting in the given probabilities:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can compute \(P(M|W)\):

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
