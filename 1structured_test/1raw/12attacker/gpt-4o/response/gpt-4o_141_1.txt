Let's define the following:
- \( P(M) \) = Probability that the attacker is male
- \( P(F) \) = Probability that the attacker is female
- \( P(W|M) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male
- \( P(W|F) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female
- \( P(W) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \)

We need to calculate \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitute the given probabilities:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(M|W) \):

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.
