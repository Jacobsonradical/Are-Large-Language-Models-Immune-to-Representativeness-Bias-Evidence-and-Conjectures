To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - \( P(\text{Male}) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
   - \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

2. **Likelihood** (the witness's accuracy):
   - \( P(\text{Identifies Male} | \text{Male}) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(\text{Identifies Male} | \text{Female}) = 0.20 \)

3. **Posterior Probability** (what we want to find):
   - \( P(\text{Male} | \text{Identified as Male}) \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Identified as Male}) = \frac{P(\text{Identifies Male} | \text{Male}) \cdot P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Identifies Male})} \]

First, find \( P(\text{Identifies Male}) \):

\[ P(\text{Identifies Male}) = P(\text{Identifies Male} | \text{Male}) \cdot P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Identifies Male} | \text{Female}) \cdot P(\text{Female}) \]

\[ P(\text{Identifies Male}) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) \]

\[ P(\text{Identifies Male}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now use this to find the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Identified as Male}) = \frac{0.80 * 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Identified as Male}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately:

{probability: 0.41}
