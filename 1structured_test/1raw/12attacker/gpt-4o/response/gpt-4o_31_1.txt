To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the relevant notation and the steps to calculate it:

- Let \( P(M) \) be the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- Let \( P(F) \) be the prior probability that the attacker is female.
- Let \( P(W | M) \) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- Let \( P(W | F) \) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female.
- Let \( P(W) \) be the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Given data:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(M | W) \):
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.414 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
