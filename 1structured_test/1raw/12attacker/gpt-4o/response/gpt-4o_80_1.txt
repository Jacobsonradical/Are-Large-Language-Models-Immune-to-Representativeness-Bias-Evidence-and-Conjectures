To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as male.

From the information provided:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is female)
- \( P(W | M) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male)
- \( P(W | F) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, since the witness errs 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we want to find \( P(M | W) \):

\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \):

\[
P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F)
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can find \( P(M | W) \):

\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
