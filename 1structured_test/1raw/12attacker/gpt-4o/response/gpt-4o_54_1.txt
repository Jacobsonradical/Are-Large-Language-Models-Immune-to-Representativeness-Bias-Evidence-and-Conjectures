To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( M \): the attacker is male.
- \( F \): the attacker is female.
- \( W_M \): the witness identifies the attacker as male.
- \( W_F \): the witness identifies the attacker as female.

We need to find \( P(M | W_M) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]

First, let's determine each component of this formula:

1. **Prior probability of the attacker being male, \( P(M) \):**
   \[ P(M) = 0.15 \]

2. **Prior probability of the attacker being female, \( P(F) \):**
   \[ P(F) = 0.85 \]

3. **Conditional probability that the witness identifies a male as male, \( P(W_M | M) \):**
   \[ P(W_M | M) = 0.80 \]

4. **Conditional probability that the witness identifies a female as male, \( P(W_M | F) \):**
   \[ P(W_M | F) = 0.20 \]

Next, we need to calculate \( P(W_M) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:

\[ P(W_M) = P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_M | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(W_M) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(M | W_M) \):

\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_M) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41.

Thus, the answer is:
{probability: 0.41}
