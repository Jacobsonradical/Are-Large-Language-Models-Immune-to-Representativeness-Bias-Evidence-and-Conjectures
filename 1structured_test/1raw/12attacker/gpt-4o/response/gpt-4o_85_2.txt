To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the evidence, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \(M\): The attacker is male.
- \(F\): The attacker is female.
- \(W_M\): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

The given probabilities are:

1. \(P(M) = 0.15\) (The probability that any given person in the city is male).
2. \(P(F) = 0.85\) (The probability that any given person in the city is female).
3. \(P(W_M \mid M) = 0.80\) (The probability that a male is correctly identified as male by the witness).
4. \(P(W_M \mid F) = 0.20\) (The probability that a female is incorrectly identified as male by the witness).

We need to find \(P(M \mid W_M)\), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{P(W_M \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]

First, we need to find \(P(W_M)\), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_M) = P(W_M \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_M \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W_M) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \(P(M \mid W_M)\):

\[ P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_M) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
