To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the following events:
- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W_m \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.
- \( W_f \): The witness identifies the attacker as female.

We need to find \( P(M|W_m) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(M|W_m) = \frac{P(W_m|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W_m|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that a random person from the population is male.
- \( P(W_m) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information provided:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
- \( P(W_m|M) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_f|M) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies males as females 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_m|F) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_f|F) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies females 80% of the time)

To find \( P(W_m) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_m) = P(W_m|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_m|F) \cdot P(F) \]

So:
\[ P(W_m) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W_m) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W_m) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W_m) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
