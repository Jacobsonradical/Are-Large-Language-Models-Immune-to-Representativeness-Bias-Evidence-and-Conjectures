To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(M | W) \), where \( M \) is the event that the attacker is male, and \( W \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a random person in the city is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a random person in the city is female)
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness identified the attacker as male given the attacker is male)
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness identified the attacker as male given the attacker is female)

We seek \( P(M | W) \), which can be found using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
