To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male or female) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's define the following events:
- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W_m \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \): Prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \): Prior probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W_m | M) = 0.80 \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker.
- \( P(W_m | F) = 0.20 \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male.

We want to find \( P(M | W_m) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)} \]

To find \( P(W_m) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_m) = P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_m | F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W_m) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(M | W_m) \):
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_m) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
