To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W_{\text{male}} \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.
- \( W_{\text{female}} \): The witness identifies the attacker as female.

We are given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_{\text{male}} | M) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W_{\text{female}} | M) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(W_{\text{female}} | F) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W_{\text{male}} | F) = 0.2 \)

We want to find \( P(M | W_{\text{male}}) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W_{\text{male}}) = \frac{P(W_{\text{male}} | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_{\text{male}})} \]

To calculate \( P(W_{\text{male}}) \):

\[ P(W_{\text{male}}) = P(W_{\text{male}} | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_{\text{male}} | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ P(W_{\text{male}}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_{\text{male}}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_{\text{male}}) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W_{\text{male}}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_{\text{male}}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_{\text{male}}) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414.
