To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the given information, we have the following probabilities:

- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (probability that any randomly selected person is male).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (probability that any randomly selected person is female).
- \( P(W \mid M) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male).
- \( P(W \mid F) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).

We need to find \( P(M \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can substitute back into Bayes' theorem to find \( P(M \mid W) \):

\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
