To solve this, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

Let's define the events:
- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the given information:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a male)
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

We are looking for \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
