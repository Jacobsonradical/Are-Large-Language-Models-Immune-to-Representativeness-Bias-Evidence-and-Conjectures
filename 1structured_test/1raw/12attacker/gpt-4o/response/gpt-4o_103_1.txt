To determine the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( M \) denote the event that the attacker is male and \( F \) denote the event that the attacker is female. Let \( W_m \) denote the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to calculate \( P(M | W_m) \).

First, we note the following probabilities provided in the problem:

1. \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (the probability that a randomly selected person in the city is male).
2. \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (the probability that a randomly selected person in the city is female).
3. \( P(W_m | M) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male).
4. \( P(W_m | F) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can write:
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)} \]

To find \( P(W_m) \):
\[ P(W_m) = P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_m | F) \cdot P(F) \]
Substitute the known values:
\[ P(W_m) = (0.80) \cdot (0.15) + (0.20) \cdot (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(M | W_m) \):
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{(0.80) \cdot (0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately:
