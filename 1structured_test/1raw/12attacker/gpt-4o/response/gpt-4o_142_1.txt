To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Specifically, we need to calculate \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

First, let's identify each component:

1. \( P(W|M) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male, is 0.8 (80%).
2. \( P(M) \), the probability that any given person in the city is male, is 0.15 (15%).
3. \( P(F) \), the probability that any given person in the city is female, is 0.85 (85%).

Now, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This includes both the cases when the attacker is actually male and when the attacker is actually female. Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|F) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female, which is 0.2 (20%) because the witness errs in 20% of cases.

So,

\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore,
