To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Define the terms:**
   - \( P(M) \): Probability that the attacker is male.
   - \( P(W|M) \): Probability that the witness says the attacker is male given that the attacker is indeed male.
   - \( P(W|F) \): Probability that the witness says the attacker is male given that the attacker is female.
   - \( P(F) \): Probability that the attacker is female.
   - \( P(W) \): The overall probability that the witness says the attacker is male.

2. **Given data:**
   - \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (80% correct identification if male)
   - \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (20% incorrect identification if female, which is 1 - 80%)
   - \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
   - \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

3. **Calculate \( P(W) \):**
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.29
   \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(M|W) \):**
   \[
   P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)}
   \]
   \[
   P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(M|W) \approx 0.414
   \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population distribution is:

\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.414} \}
\]
