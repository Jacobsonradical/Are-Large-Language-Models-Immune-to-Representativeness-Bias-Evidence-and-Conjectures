To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( M \): The event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \): The event that the attacker is female.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:

- \( P(W \mid M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information provided:

- \( P(W \mid M) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- \( P(W \mid F) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

Now we need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(M \mid W) \):

\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

\{probability: 0.4138\}
