To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we identify and calculate the required probabilities:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(M) \): The prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 15% or 0.15.
   - \( P(F) \): The prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 85% or 0.85.

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(W | M) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 80% or 0.8.
   - \( P(W | F) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 20% or 0.2.

3. **Marginal Probability** \( P(W) \) (the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male):
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(M | W) \):

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is {probability: 0.4138}.
