To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's break down the information:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - Probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is male, \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
   - Probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is female, \( P(F) = 0.85 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male, \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \)
   - Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \)

We need to find the posterior probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) * P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to compute the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{(0.80 * 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.41 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41.

So, the final answer is:

{probability: 0.41}
