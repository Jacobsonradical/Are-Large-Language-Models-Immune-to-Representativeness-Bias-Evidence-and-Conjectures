To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population gender distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information given:
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male 20% of the time).
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female).

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

Here is the answer in the required format:
