To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update our beliefs in light of new evidence. Let's denote the following events:

- \(M\): Attacker is male.
- \(F\): Attacker is female.
- \(W\): Witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to find \(P(M|W)\), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \(P(M|W)\) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.
- \(P(W|M)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \(P(M)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \(P(W)\) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

First, let's find the necessary components:

1. \(P(M)\): The prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 15% or 0.15.
2. \(P(W|M)\): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male, which is 80% or 0.8.
3. \(P(W|F)\): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female, which is the error rate, 20%, or 0.2.
4. \(P(F)\): The prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 85% or 0.85.

Next, we calculate \(P(W)\) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \(P(M|W)\):
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
