To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male if they are indeed male (which is 80% or 0.80).
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that any given person in the city is male (which is 15% or 0.15).
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as male.

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|F) \) is the probability that the witness misidentified a female as a male (which is 20% or 0.20, because the witness makes a mistake 20% of the time).
- \( P(F) \) is the prior probability that any given person in the city is female (which is 85% or 0.85).

Let's compute these probabilities step by step:

1. Calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

2. Use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(M|W) \):
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
