To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break down the information given and apply the theorem step-by-step.

### Notations:
- \( P(M) \): Probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) \): Probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(WM|M) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male.
- \( P(WM|F) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.
- \( P(M|WM) \): Posterior probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

### Given Values:
1. \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
2. \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
3. \( P(WM|M) = 0.80 \)
4. \( P(WM|F) = 0.20 \)

### Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|WM) = \frac{P(WM|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(WM)} \]

Where \( P(WM) \) (total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(WM) = P(WM|M) \cdot P(M) + P(WM|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitute the given values:
\[ P(WM) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(WM) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(WM) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|WM) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|WM) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|WM) \approx 0.414 \]

### Conclusion:
{probability: 0.414}
