To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( M \) denote that the attacker is male, and \( W \) denote that the attacker is female. Let \( E \) denote the event where the witness identifies the attacker as male. We are looking for \( P(M | E) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, we define the known probabilities:

- \( P(M) \): The prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \): The prior probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(E | M) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male.
- \( P(E | W) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.

These probabilities are:

- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E | M) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E | W) = 0.20 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M | E) = \frac{P(E | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(E)}
\]

To find \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, we use:

\[
P(E) = P(E | M) \cdot P(M) + P(E | W) \cdot P(W)
\]

Substituting the known probabilities:

\[
P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.29
\]

Now, we can find \( P(M | E) \):

\[
P(M | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(M | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(M | E) \approx 0.414
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately:

\[
{probability: 0.414}
\]
