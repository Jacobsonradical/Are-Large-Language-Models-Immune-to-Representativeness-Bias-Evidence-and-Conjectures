To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update probabilities based on new evidence. The theorem is stated as:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F)} \]

where:
- \( P(M | W) \) is the probability the attacker is male given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W | M) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies a male as male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being male.
- \( P(F) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being female.
- \( P(W | F) \) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female as a male.

From the information given:

- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female).
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time).
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a female as a male 20% of the time).

First, we organize the information to plug into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(W | M) \cdot P(M) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \]
\[ P(W | F) \cdot P(F) = 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.17 \]

Now, compute the denominator:

\[ P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.414} \]
