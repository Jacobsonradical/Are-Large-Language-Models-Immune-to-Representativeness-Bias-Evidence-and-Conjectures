To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here are the notations we'll use:

- \( P(M) \): Probability that the attacker is male (prior probability).
- \( P(F) \): Probability that the attacker is female (prior probability).
- \( P(W|M) \): Probability that the witness identified the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W|F) \): Probability that the witness identified the attacker as male given that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W) \): Probability that the witness identified the attacker as male (overall).

From the information provided:

- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female).
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (Witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (Witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time).

Now, we need to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(M|W) \):

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
