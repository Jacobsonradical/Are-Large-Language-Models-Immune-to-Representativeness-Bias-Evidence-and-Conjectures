To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs with new evidence. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W_m \): The witness identified the attacker as male.

Given:

- \( P(W_m | M) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_m | F) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)

We need to find \( P(M | W_m) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)} \]

To find \( P(W_m) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_m) = P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_m | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Plugging in the given values:

\[ P(W_m) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_m) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.
