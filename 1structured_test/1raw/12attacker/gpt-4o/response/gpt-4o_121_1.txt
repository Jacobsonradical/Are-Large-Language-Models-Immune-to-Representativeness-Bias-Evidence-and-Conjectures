To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We need to calculate \( P(M|W) \): the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, we summarize the given probabilities:

1. The prior probabilities:
   - \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
   - \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

2. The witness's accuracy rate:
   - \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time)
   - \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male 20% of the time, because the witness has an 80% accuracy rate at identifying gender)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F)}
\]

Substitute in the known values:

\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85}
\]

Calculate the numerator:

\[
0.80 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12
\]

Calculate the denominator:

\[
0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

So,

\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\text{{probability: }} 0.4138
\]

Therefore, in the requested format, the answer is:

\[
\{ \text{{probability: }} 0.4138 \}
\]
