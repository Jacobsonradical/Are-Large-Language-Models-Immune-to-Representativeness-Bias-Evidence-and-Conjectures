To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define the Events:**
   - \( M \): The event that the attacker is male.
   - \( F \): The event that the attacker is female.
   - \( W_M \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

2. **Known Probabilities:**
   - \( P(M) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen person in the city is male.
   - \( P(F) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that any randomly chosen person in the city is female.
   - \( P(W_M \mid M) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male.
   - \( P(W_M \mid F) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.

3. **Calculate \( P(W_M) \) (Total Probability):**

\[ P(W_M) = P(W_M \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_M \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W_M) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.29 \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

\[ P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{P(W_M \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_M) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the city's population distribution, is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
