To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates conditional probabilities and can be written as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being male.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male overall.

From the given information:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time).
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time).
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (probability that any randomly chosen person in the city is male).
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (probability that any randomly chosen person in the city is female).

To compute \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can substitute these values back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:
\{probability: 0.4138\}
