To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information from the witness and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where,
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a random person from the population is male.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the problem:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is male).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (since the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (since the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is female).

We first calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately:

{probability: 0.41}
