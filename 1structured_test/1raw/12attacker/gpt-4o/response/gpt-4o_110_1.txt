To determine the probability that the attacker is male given the information from the witness and the population distribution, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following:

- M: The event that the attacker is male.
- F: The event that the attacker is female.
- \( W_m \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.
- \( P(M) \): The prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) \): The prior probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W_m | M) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W_m | F) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female.

From the information provided:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_m | M) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_m | F) = 0.20 \)

We need to find \( P(M | W_m) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(M | W_m) = \frac{P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)}
\]

Where \( P(W_m) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W_m) = P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_m | F) \cdot P(F)
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
P(W_m) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Using this in Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(M | W_m) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
