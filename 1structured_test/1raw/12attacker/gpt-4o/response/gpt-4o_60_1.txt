To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identification and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( M \): The event that the attacker is male.
- \( W_M \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find \( P(M \mid W_M) \): the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{P(W_M \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W_M \mid M) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker, which is 0.80 (or 80%).
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (or 15%).
- \( P(W_M) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Let's compute \( P(W_M) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_M) = P(W_M \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_M \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]

Where:
- \( P(W_M \mid F) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male, which is 0.20 (or 20% because the witness errs 20% of the time).
- \( P(F) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85 (or 85%).

Putting these values together:
\[ P(W_M) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(M \mid W_M) \):
\[ P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_M) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41.
