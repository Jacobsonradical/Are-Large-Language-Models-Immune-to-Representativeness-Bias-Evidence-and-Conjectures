To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. Define the events:
   - \( M \): The attacker is male.
   - \( F \): The attacker is female.
   - \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

2. Given probabilities:
   - \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (Probability that the attacker is male, based on population statistics)
   - \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (Probability that the attacker is female, based on population statistics)
   - \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies a male)
   - \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

3. Use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(M | W) \):
   \[
   P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F)}
   \]

4. Substitute the values into the equation:
   \[
   P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85}
   \]

5. Calculate the denominator:
   \[
   0.80 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12
   \]
   \[
   0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.17
   \]
   \[
   0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

6. Calculate the final probability:
   \[
   P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately \( 0.4138 \).
