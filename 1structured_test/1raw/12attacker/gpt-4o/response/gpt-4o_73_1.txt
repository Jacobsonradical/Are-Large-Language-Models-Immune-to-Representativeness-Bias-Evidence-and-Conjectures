To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayesâ€™ theorem helps us update the probability estimate for an event based on new information. 

Let's define the events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

The relevant probabilities are:

- \( P(M) \): The prior probability that the attacker is male = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male).
- \( P(F) \): The prior probability that the attacker is female = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female).
- \( P(W|M) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, this is 0.80.
- \( P(W|F) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this is 0.20.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) (the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitution gives:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Then, we find \( P(M|W) \):

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.414}
