To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( M \) as the event "the attacker is male."
- \( F \) as the event "the attacker is female."
- \( W \) as the event "the witness identified the attacker as male."

We need to compute \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, we compute the prior probabilities:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

Next, we consider the likelihoods:
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(M | W) \) is given by:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting in our values:

\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(M | W) \):

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.

\text{{probability}}: 0.4138
