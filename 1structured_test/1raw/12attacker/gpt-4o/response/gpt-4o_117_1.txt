To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's define our events:
- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the given information, we have the following probabilities:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- The probability the witness correctly identifies a male as male: \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \)
- The probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male: \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \)

We need to find \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(M | W) \):

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is about 0.4138.
