To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \) as the event that the attacker is female.
- \( W_m \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the given information:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability the attacker is male).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability the attacker is female).
- The witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time: \( P(W_m \mid M) = 0.80 \).
- The witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time: \( P(W_m \mid F) = 0.20 \).

We need to find \( P(M \mid W_m) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(M \mid W_m) = \frac{P(W_m \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W_m) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be computed by considering both cases where the attacker is male and female:

\[ P(W_m) = P(W_m \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_m \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]

Plugging the values:

\[ P(W_m) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.29 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M \mid W_m) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_m) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_m) \approx 0.41 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately \( \mathbf{0.41} \).

So, the answer in the required format is:

{probability: 0.41}
