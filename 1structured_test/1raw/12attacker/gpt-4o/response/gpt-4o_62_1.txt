To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( M \): The event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \): The event that the attacker is female.
- \( W_M \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We are given:

- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population in the city is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population in the city is female)
- \( P(W_M | M) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male if the attacker is indeed male)
- \( P(W_M | F) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male if the attacker is actually female)

We need to find \( P(M | W_M) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]

To find \( P(W_M) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_M) = P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_M | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ P(W_M) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(M | W_M) \):

\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_M) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.414 \} \]
