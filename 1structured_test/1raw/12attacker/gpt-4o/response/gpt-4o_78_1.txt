To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote the following events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to calculate \( P(M \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified them as male.

First, we identify the required probabilities:

1. \( P(M) \): The prior probability that the attacker is male. From the given information, \( P(M) = 0.15 \).
2. \( P(F) \): The prior probability that the attacker is female. From the given information, \( P(F) = 0.85 \).
3. \( P(W \mid M) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male. From the given information about the witness's accuracy, \( P(W \mid M) = 0.80 \).
4. \( P(W \mid F) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female. Given the witness makes an error 20% of the time, \( P(W \mid F) = 0.20 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) P(M)}{P(W)}
\]
where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We can calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W \mid M) P(M) + P(W \mid F) P(F)
\]

Substituting in the known values:
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we calculate \( P(M \mid W) \):
\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.41.

\[
\boxed{\{probability: 0.41\}}
\]
