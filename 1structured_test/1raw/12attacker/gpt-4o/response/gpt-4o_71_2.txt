To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identification and the demographic distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps broken down:

1. Let \( M \) represent the event that the attacker is male.
2. Let \( W \) represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (Probability that any random person in the city is male)
- \( P(\neg M) = 0.85 \) (Probability that any random person in the city is female)
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- \( P(W | \neg M) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

We want to find \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | \neg M) \cdot P(\neg M) \]

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(M | W) \):

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
