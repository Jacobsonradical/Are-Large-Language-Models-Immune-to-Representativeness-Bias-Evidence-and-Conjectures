To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can use the given information:

Let:
- \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male.
- \( W \) be the event that the attacker is female.
- \( E \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M|E) \): the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|E) = \frac{P(E|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male: \( 0.15 \) (15% of the population).
- \( P(E|M) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker as male: \( 0.8 \) (80% correctness rate).
- \( P(E|W) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male: \( 0.2 \) (20% error rate).
- \( P(W) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is female: \( 0.85 \) (85% of the population).

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|M) \cdot P(M) + P(E|W) \cdot P(W) \]

Now, substituting the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(M|E) \):

\[ P(M|E) = \frac{P(E|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(M|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: \; 0.4138 \} \]
