To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \) as the event that the attacker is female.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, let's compute each of these probabilities:

1. \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (given in the problem, the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time).
2. \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male).
3. \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female).
4. \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, if the attacker is female, the witness identifies as male 20% of the time).

Now, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as male:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately \( 0.4138 \).

Hence, the answer is:
