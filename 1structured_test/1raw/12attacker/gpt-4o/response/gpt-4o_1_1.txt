To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can structure the problem:

1. Let \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male.
2. Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W | M) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We have:
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time if the attacker is male)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

To find \( P(W) \), we need to consider both cases where the witness says the attacker is male:
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Where \( P(W | F) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female:
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time if the attacker is female)

Putting it all together:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
