To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define the Events:**
   - \( M \): The attacker is male.
   - \( F \): The attacker is female.
   - \( W_{M} \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \( P(M) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that the attacker is male.
   - \( P(F) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that the attacker is female.
   - \( P(W_{M} | M) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male.
   - \( P(W_{M} | F) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male.

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   - Bayes' Theorem states: 
     \[
     P(M | W_{M}) = \frac{P(W_{M} | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_{M})}
     \]
   - We need to find \( P(W_{M}) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as male:
     \[
     P(W_{M}) = P(W_{M} | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_{M} | F) \cdot P(F)
     \]
     \[
     P(W_{M}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
     \]

4. **Calculate the Posterior Probability:**
   \[
   P(M | W_{M}) = \frac{P(W_{M} | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_{M})} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately:

{ probability: 0.4138 }
