To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our probability estimates based on new evidence.

Let's denote the following events:
- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W_m \): The witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M | W_m) \), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)} \]

We break down the components:

1. \( P(M) \): Prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 15% or 0.15.
2. \( P(F) \): Prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 85% or 0.85.
3. \( P(W_m | M) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male, which is 80% or 0.8.
4. \( P(W_m | F) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female, which is 20% or 0.2.

Next, we need to calculate \( P(W_m) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_m) = P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_m | F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W_m) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.29 \]

Now using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)} \]
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_m) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W_m) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
