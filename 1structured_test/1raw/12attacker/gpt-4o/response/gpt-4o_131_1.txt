To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population gender distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(M) \): Probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) \): Probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W|M) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W|F) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information provided:
- P(M) = 0.15
- P(F) = 0.85
- P(W|M) = 0.8
- P(W|F) = 0.2

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

We need to compute \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately 0.4138.

So,

\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
