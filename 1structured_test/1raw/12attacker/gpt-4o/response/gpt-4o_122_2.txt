To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male (based on the population statistics).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male.

First, let's define the given values:
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time).
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability that the attacker is male).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (The prior probability that the attacker is female).

Now, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
