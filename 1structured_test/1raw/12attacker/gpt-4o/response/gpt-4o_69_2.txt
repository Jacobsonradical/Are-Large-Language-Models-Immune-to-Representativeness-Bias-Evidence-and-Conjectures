To determine the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown of how to apply it to this problem:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(\text{Male}) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Given that the attacker is male, the probability that the witness identifies them as male: \( P(\text{Identified as Male} | \text{Male}) = 0.80 \)
   - Given that the attacker is female, the probability that the witness identifies them as male: \( P(\text{Identified as Male} | \text{Female}) = 0.20 \)

3. **Posterior probability:**
   - We want to find \( P(\text{Male} | \text{Identified as Male}) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(\text{Male} | \text{Identified as Male}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified as Male} | \text{Male}) \cdot P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Identified as Male})}
\]

First, calculate \( P(\text{Identified as Male}) \):
\[
P(\text{Identified as Male}) = P(\text{Identified as Male} | \text{Male}) \cdot P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Identified as Male} | \text{Female}) \cdot P(\text{Female})
\]
\[
P(\text{Identified as Male}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(\text{Male} | \text{Identified as Male}) \):
\[
P(\text{Male} | \text{Identified as Male}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

Simplify this:
\[
P(\text{Male} | \text{Identified as Male}) \approx 0.4138
\]

Hence, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
