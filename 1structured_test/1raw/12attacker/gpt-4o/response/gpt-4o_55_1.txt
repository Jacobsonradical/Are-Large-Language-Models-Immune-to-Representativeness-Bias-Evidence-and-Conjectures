To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the relevant events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W_m \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information provided:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_m | M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies male)
- \( P(W_m | F) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies female as male)

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(M | W_m) \):

\[
P(M | W_m) = \frac{P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)}
\]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W_m) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male:

\[
P(W_m) = P(W_m | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_m | F) \cdot P(F)
\]

\[
P(W_m) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W_m) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we can calculate \( P(M | W_m) \):

\[
P(M | W_m) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(M | W_m) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \}
\]
