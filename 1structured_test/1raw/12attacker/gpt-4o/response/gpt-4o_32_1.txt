To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identification and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Identified Male}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified Male} | \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Identified Male})} \]

We need to calculate:
1. \( P(\text{Identified Male} | \text{Male}) \): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male.
2. \( P(\text{Male}) \): the prior probability that a randomly chosen person is male.
3. \( P(\text{Identified Male}) \): the total probability that the witness would identify someone as male.

Given data:
- The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
- \( P(\text{Identified Male} | \text{Male}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{Identified Male} | \text{Female}) = 0.2 \) (since the error rate is 20%)
- The city population is 85% female and 15% male.
- \( P(\text{Male}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \)

Now, we calculate \( P(\text{Identified Male}) \):
\[ P(\text{Identified Male}) = P(\text{Identified Male} | \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Identified Male} | \text{Female}) \times P(\text{Female}) \]
\[ P(\text{Identified Male}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Identified Male}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Identified Male}) = 0.29 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Identified Male}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Identified Male}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Identified Male}) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
