To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population statistics, we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|W) \): Probability the attacker is male given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|M) \): Probability the witness identifies a male given the attacker is male (80% or 0.80).
- \( P(M) \): Probability a random person is male (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(W) \): Total probability the witness identifies the attacker as male.

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), which is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can happen if the attacker is either male or female:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|F) \): Probability the witness identifies a female as male (error rate, so 20% or 0.20).
- \( P(F) \): Probability a random person is female (85% or 0.85).

Now, plug in the numbers:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Next, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately 0.4138.

Here is the result in the requested format:
\[ {probability: 0.4138} \]
