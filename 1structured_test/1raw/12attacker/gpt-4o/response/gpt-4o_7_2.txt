We can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population proportions. 

Let's denote:
- \( M \): The event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \): The event that the attacker is female.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the given information:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- The witness's accuracy is 80%, so:
  - \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (since they err 20% of the time)

We want to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as male. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(M|W) \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
