To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following terms:
- \( P(M) \): The prior probability that any given person is male. According to the population distribution, \( P(M) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(F) \): The prior probability that any given person is female. So, \( P(F) = 0.85 \).
- \( P(W|M) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male. This is 80%, so \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(W|F) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male. This is 20%, so \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \).

We want to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitute the values we know:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(M|W) \):

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414.
