To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. 

We are given:
- The prior probabilities: \( P(\text{Male}) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \).
- The witness's accuracy: \( P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Male}) = 0.80 \) and \( P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Female}) = 0.20 \).

We want to find the posterior probability \( P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Male}) \cdot P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Witness says Male})} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(\text{Witness says Male}) \):
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Male}) \cdot P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Female}) \cdot P(\text{Female}) \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute this back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.41 \} \]

(Note: The slight rounding difference in the detailed calculation and final presentation is standard in estimations. Both 0.4138 and 0.41 are close representations.)
