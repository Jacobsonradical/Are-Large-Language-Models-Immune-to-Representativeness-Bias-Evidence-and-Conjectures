To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

We define the following events:
- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
1. \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
2. \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
3. If the attacker is male, the witness correctly identifies the gender \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) and erred in \( 0.20 \).
4. If the attacker is female, the witness incorrectly identifies the gender \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (and correctly identifies \( 0.80 \)).

We need to find \( P(M | W) \), which can be computed using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F)
\]

Plugging in the given values:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W) = (0.12) + (0.17)
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now, we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(M | W) \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
