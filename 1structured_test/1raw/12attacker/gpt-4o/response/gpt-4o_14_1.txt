To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can compute it step-by-step:

1. Define the events:
   - Let \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male.
   - Let \( F \) be the event that the attacker is female.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

2. Given probabilities:
   - \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
   - \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)
   - The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male: \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \)
   - The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male: \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \)

3. Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \times P(M)}{P(W)}
   \]

4. Calculate \( P(W) \):
   \[
   P(W) = P(W | M) \times P(M) + P(W | F) \times P(F)
   \]
   Substitute the values:
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

5. Now, compute \( P(M | W) \):
   \[
   P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
