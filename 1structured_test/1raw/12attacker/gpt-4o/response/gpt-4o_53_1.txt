To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as additional evidence is presented.

We need to find \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Let's denote the following:
- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \) as the event that the attacker is female.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that a person from the city is male).
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that a person from the city is female).
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker).
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F)} \]

First, we calculate the denominator:
\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
