We can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male based on the information provided.

Let's define:
- \( P(M) \) = Probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) \) = Probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W|M) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male.
- \( P(W|F) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female.
- \( P(W) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the information given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is female)
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We need to calculate \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can plug \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
