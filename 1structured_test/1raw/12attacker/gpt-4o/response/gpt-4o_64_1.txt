To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population's gender distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W_m \): The witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find \( P(M|W_m) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(M|W_m) = \frac{P(W_m|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)}
\]

First, let's define each probability:

1. \( P(M) \): The prior probability that a random person in the city is male. Given by the population distribution:
   \[
   P(M) = 0.15
   \]

2. \( P(F) \): The prior probability that a random person in the city is female:
   \[
   P(F) = 0.85
   \]

3. \( P(W_m|M) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male (sensitivity):
   \[
   P(W_m|M) = 0.80
   \]

4. \( P(W_m|F) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male (false positive rate):
   \[
   P(W_m|F) = 0.20
   \]

Now, we need to find \( P(W_m) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, regardless of the actual gender of the attacker. This is given by the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(W_m) = P(W_m|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_m|F) \cdot P(F)
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
P(W_m) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W_m) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(M|W_m) \):

\[
P(M|W_m) = \frac{P(W_m|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(M|W_m) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.414 \}
\]
