To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how:

1. **Define the Known Probabilities:**
   - P(M) = Probability that a random person is male = 0.15
   - P(F) = Probability that a random person is female = 0.85
   - P(E|M) = Probability that the witness identifies a male correctly = 0.80
   - P(E|F) = Probability that the witness identifies a female incorrectly as male (false positive) = 0.20

2. **Calculate the Probability that the Witness Identifies the Attacker as Male:**
   - P(E) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male
   
   P(E) can be found by considering both scenarios where the witness might say the attacker is male:
   - Scenario 1: The attacker is actually male, and the witness correctly identifies him = P(M) * P(E|M)
   - Scenario 2: The attacker is actually female, and the witness incorrectly identifies her as male = P(F) * P(E|F)
   
   So:
   \[
   P(E) = P(M) \times P(E|M) + P(F) \times P(E|F)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.15 \times 0.80) + (0.85 \times 0.20) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   Bayes' Theorem states:
   \[
   P(M|E) = \frac{P(E|M) \times P(M)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   P(M|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.

Hence, the answer in the required format is:

```json
{probability: 0.4138}
