To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the demographic information, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- \( P(M) \) as the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15.
- \( P(F) \) as the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85.
- \( P(W|M) \) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is male given that the attacker is actually male, which is 0.80.
- \( P(W|F) \) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is male given that the attacker is actually female, which is 0.20.

We want to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Calculating \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(M|W) \):
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414.
