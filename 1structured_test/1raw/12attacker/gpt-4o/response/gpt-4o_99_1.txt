To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \) as the event that the attacker is female.
- \( W_m \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We approximate the probability using the following information:

1. \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (Base rate or prior probability that the attacker is male, given 15% of the population is male).
2. \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (Base rate that the attacker is female, given 85% of the population is female).
3. \( P(W_m \mid M) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male).
4. \( P(W_m \mid F) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male).

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(M \mid W_m) = \frac{P(W_m \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_m)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W_m) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_m) = P(W_m \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_m \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W_m) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_m) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M \mid W_m) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_m) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_m) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]
