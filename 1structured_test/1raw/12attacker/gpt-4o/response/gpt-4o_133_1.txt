To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

We have:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (the probability the attacker is male based on the city population)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (the probability the attacker is female based on the city population)
- \( P(W | M) = 0.8 \) (the probability the witness correctly identifies a male attacker as male)
- \( P(W | F) = 0.2 \) (the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male)

Next, we need \( P(W) \), the overall probability that the witness identified the attacker as male. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
