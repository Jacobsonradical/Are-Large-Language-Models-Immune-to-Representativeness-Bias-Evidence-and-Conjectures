To estimate the probability that the attacker is male based on the given information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

First, we need the individual probabilities:
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (prior probability of a male attacker, given the population distribution)

Next, we determine \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Where:
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (prior probability of a female attacker, given the population distribution)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Substitute the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
