To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, we will use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|M) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen person is male.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

To calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies a male, we use:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|F) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male.
- \( P(F) \) is the prior probability that any randomly chosen person is female.

Given the information:
- The witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time: \( P(W|M) = 0.8 \)
- The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time: \( P(W|F) = 0.2 \)
- The prior probability that a person is male: \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- The prior probability that a person is female: \( P(F) = 0.85 \)

Now, calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(M|W) \):

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately 0.4138.
