To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. 

First, let's define the events:
- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W_M \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.
- \( P(M) \): Prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) \): Prior probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W_M \mid M) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is male.
- \( P(W_M \mid F) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given the attacker is female.

Given data:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_M \mid M) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_M \mid F) = 0.20 \)

Now, we want to find \( P(M \mid W_M) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{P(W_M \mid M) P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]

To find \( P(W_M) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_M) = P(W_M \mid M) P(M) + P(W_M \mid F) P(F) \]

Calculate \( P(W_M) \):
\[ P(W_M) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W_M) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.41}
