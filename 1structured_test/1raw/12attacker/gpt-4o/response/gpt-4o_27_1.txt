To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population gender distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is male.
- \( B \) is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We need to find:
\[ P(\text{Male}|\text{Identified Male}) \]

Given:
- \( P(\text{Male}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(\text{Identified Male}|\text{Male}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{Identified Male}|\text{Female}) = 0.2 \)

First, we calculate \( P(\text{Identified Male}) \):

\[ P(\text{Identified Male}) = P(\text{Identified Male}|\text{Male})P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Identified Male}|\text{Female})P(\text{Female}) \]

\[ P(\text{Identified Male}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]

\[ P(\text{Identified Male}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(\text{Identified Male}) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{Male}|\text{Identified Male}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified Male}|\text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Identified Male})} \]

\[ P(\text{Male}|\text{Identified Male}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(\text{Male}|\text{Identified Male}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(\text{Male}|\text{Identified Male}) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
