To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W_M \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.
- \( W_F \): The witness identifies the attacker as female.

From the problem, we are given:

- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_M | M) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_M | F) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(M | W_M) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[
P(M | W_M) = \frac{P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)}
\]

To find \( P(W_M) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(W_M) = P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_M | F) \cdot P(F)
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
P(W_M) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we can calculate \( P(M | W_M) \):

\[
P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is roughly 0.4138.

\[
\{probability: 0.4138\}
\]
