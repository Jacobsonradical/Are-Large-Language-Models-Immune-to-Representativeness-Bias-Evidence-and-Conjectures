To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(M) \) = Probability that the attacker is male
- \( P(F) \) = Probability that the attacker is female
- \( P(W|M) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male
- \( P(W|F) \) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female
- \( P(M|W) \) = Probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identifies the attacker as male

From the information given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, we use:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(M|W) \):

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.41 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41.
