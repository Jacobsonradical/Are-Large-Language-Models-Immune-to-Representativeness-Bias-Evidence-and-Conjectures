To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll define the following events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

First, let's determine the prior probabilities:
- \( P(M) \): The probability that a person in the city is male is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(F) \): The probability that a person in the city is female is 85% or 0.85.

Next, we'll use the witness's accuracy to find the likelihoods:
- \( P(W|M) \): The probability that the witness identifies a male as male is 80% or 0.80.
- \( P(W|F) \): The probability that the witness identifies a female as male is 20% or 0.20.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)}
\]

where
\[
P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F)
\]

Now, we can calculate \( P(W) \):
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting these into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
