To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identification and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Let's denote:

- \(M\): the event that the attacker is male.
- \(F\): the event that the attacker is female.
- \(W\): the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are looking for \(P(M|W)\), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M)P(M)}{P(W)} \]

We break this down as follows:

- \( P(M) \): the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- \( P(F) \): the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85 (85% of the population).

The probabilities \( P(W|M) \) and \( P(W|F) \) represent the reliability of the witness:

- \( P(W|M) = \) the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|F) = \) the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female, which is 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time).

To apply Bayes' Theorem, we also need \(P(W)\), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be found using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|M)P(M) + P(W|F)P(F) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can compute \(P(M|W)\):

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M)P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population statistics, is approximately 0.4138.
