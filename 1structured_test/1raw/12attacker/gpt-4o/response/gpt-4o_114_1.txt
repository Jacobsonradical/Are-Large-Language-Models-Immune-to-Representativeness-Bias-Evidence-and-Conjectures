To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update the probability estimate based on new evidence. Let's define the events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is female)
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

We want to find the posterior probability \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

By Bayes' Theorem,
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, which can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting the given probabilities:
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can substitute \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the probability estimate is:

{probability: 0.414}
