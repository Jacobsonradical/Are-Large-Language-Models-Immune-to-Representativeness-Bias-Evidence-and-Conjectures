To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let \( M \) be the event that the attacker is male, and \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to calculate \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|M) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(M) \): Probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W) \): Overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

First, let's identify each component:

1. \( P(W|M) \):
   The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male is 80%, so:
   \[ P(W|M) = 0.8 \]

2. \( P(M) \):
   The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is male is 15%, so:
   \[ P(M) = 0.15 \]

3. \( P(W) \):
   The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
   Where \( F \) is the event that the attacker is female, \( P(F) = 0.85 \), and \( P(W|F) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 20%:
   \[ P(W|F) = 0.2 \]
   
   Therefore:
   \[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4138.
