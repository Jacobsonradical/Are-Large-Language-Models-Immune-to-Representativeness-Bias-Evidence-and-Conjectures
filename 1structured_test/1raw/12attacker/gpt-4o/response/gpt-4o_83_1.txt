To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the city demographics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following:

- \( P(M) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is male \( = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is female \( = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_M|M) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male \( = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_F|M) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a male as female \( = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_M|F) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male \( = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_F|F) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a female as female \( = 0.80 \)

We need to find \( P(M|W_M) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W_M) = \frac{P(W_M|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_M) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.
\[ P(W_M) = P(W_M|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_M|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W_M) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_M) = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(M|W_M) \).
\[ P(M|W_M) = \frac{P(W_M|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)} \]
\[ P(M|W_M) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W_M) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W_M) \approx 0.414 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
\[ \{probability: 0.414\} \]
