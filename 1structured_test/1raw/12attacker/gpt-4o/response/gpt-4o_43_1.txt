To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior belief about an event based on new evidence.

First, let's define the relevant terms:

- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- \( P(F) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W \mid M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male.
- \( P(W \mid F) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

From the problem data:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W \mid M) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W \mid F) = 0.2 \)

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(M \mid W) \), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]

So,

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can plug \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
