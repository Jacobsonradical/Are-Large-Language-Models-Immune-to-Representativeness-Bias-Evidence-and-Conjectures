To find the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (prior probability the attacker is male based on city demographics)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (prior probability the attacker is female based on city demographics)
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

We want to calculate \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness says the attacker is male. This can be done by considering both scenarios (attacker actually male or actually female):

\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]

So,

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(M|W) \):

\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.41 \} \]
