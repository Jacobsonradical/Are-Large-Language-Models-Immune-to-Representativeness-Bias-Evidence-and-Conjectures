To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identification and population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(M \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- \( P(W \mid M) \) is the probability that the witness identifies a male attacker as male.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male regardless of the witness's identification.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We have the following data:
- \( P(W \mid M) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies male as male)
- \( P(W \mid F) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies female as male)
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is female)

Now, we need to determine \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as male. This can be done using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid M) \cdot P(M) + P(W \mid F) \cdot P(F) \]

Plugging in the values we have:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately:

\[ \{ probability: 0.414 \} \]
