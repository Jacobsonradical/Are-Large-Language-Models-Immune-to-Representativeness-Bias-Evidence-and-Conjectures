To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \) as the event that the attacker is female.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that attacker is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that attacker is female)
- \( P(W | M) = 0.80 \) (probability that witness identifies male correctly)
- \( P(W | F) = 0.20 \) (probability that witness identifies female incorrectly)

We need to find \( P(M | W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{P(W | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Substituting the given probabilities:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M | W) â‰ˆ 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.414.
