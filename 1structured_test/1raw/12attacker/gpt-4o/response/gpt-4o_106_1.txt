To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. We are given:

- The prior probability of the attacker being male, \( P(M) \), which is 15% or 0.15.
- The prior probability of the attacker being female, \( P(F) \), which is 85% or 0.85.
- The witness's reliability in identifying males and females, where they correctly identify gender 80% of the time.

We need to find \( P(M \mid E) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is male given the witness identified the attacker as male (\(E\)).

Bayes' Theorem is:
\[ P(M \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid M) P(M)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male. This can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid M)P(M) + P(E \mid F)P(F) \]

Given:
- \( P(E \mid M) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, is 0.80.
- \( P(E \mid F) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female (error), is 0.20.

Now we can substitute in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M \mid E) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M \mid E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately:
\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.41 \} \]
