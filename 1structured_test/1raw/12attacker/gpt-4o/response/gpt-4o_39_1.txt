To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:

- \( M \) as the event that the attacker is male.
- \( F \) as the event that the attacker is female.
- \( W_M \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We need to find \( P(M | W_M) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(M | W_M) = \frac{P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W_M)}
\]

Where:

- \( P(W_M | M) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is the same as the proportion of males in the population, 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W_M) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

To find \( P(W_M) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(W_M) = P(W_M | M) \cdot P(M) + P(W_M | F) \cdot P(F)
\]

Where:

- \( P(W_M | F) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male, 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(F) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is female, which is the same as the proportion of females in the population, 85% or 0.85.

Substituting these into the equation for \( P(W_M) \):

\[
P(W_M) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W_M) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(M | W_M) \):

\[
P(M | W_M) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witnessâ€™s identification, is approximately \( 0.4138 \).

\[
\{ \text{probability:} \ 0.4138 \}
\]
