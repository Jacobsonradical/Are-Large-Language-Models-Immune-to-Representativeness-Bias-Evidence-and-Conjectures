To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being male) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's define the events:
- \( M \): The attacker is male.
- \( F \): The attacker is female.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as male.

Given:
- \( P(M) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is male)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is female)
- \( P(W|M) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

We want to find \( P(M|W) \), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male:
\[ P(W) = P(W|M) \cdot P(M) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{P(W|M) \cdot P(M)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

\[ \text{{probability}}: 0.4138 \]
