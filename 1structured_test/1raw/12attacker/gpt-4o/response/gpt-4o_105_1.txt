To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the demographic information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(M|E) = \frac{P(E|M)P(M)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(M|E) \) is the probability that the attacker is male given the evidence (the witness's identification).
- \( P(E|M) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker.
- \( P(M) \) is the prior probability of any person in the population being male.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence (the identification being male).

### Given data:
1. **Witness accuracy**:
   - Probability of correctly identifying a male: \( P(E|M) = 0.8 \)
   - Probability of incorrectly identifying a male when it's actually female: \( P(E|F) = 0.2 \)

2. **Demographics**:
   - Probability of a person being male: \( P(M) = 0.15 \)
   - Probability of a person being female: \( P(F) = 0.85 \)

### Calculation:

#### Step 1: Calculate \( P(E) \)
\[ P(E) = P(E|M)P(M) + P(E|F)P(F) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

#### Step 2: Calculate \( P(M|E) \)
\[ P(M|E) = \frac{P(E|M)P(M)}{P(E)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(M|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(M|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(M|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:
\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]
