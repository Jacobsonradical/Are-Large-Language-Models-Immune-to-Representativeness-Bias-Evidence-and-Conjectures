To determine the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Hereâ€™s the formula:

\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male})}{P(\text{Witness says Male})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Male}) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- \( P(\text{Male}) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that a randomly selected person from the population is male)
- \( P(\text{Witness says Male}) \) is the total probability that the witness says the attacker is male, which we need to calculate using the law of total probability.

First, we calculate \( P(\text{Witness says Male}) \):
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Male}) \times P(\text{Male}) + P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Female}) \times P(\text{Female}) \]

Given that:
- \( P(\text{Witness says Male} | \text{Female}) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
- \( P(\text{Female}) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that a randomly selected person from the population is female)

We now calculate:
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says Male}) = 0.29 \]

Now we apply these values to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Male} | \text{Witness says Male}) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately:

{probability: 0.41}
