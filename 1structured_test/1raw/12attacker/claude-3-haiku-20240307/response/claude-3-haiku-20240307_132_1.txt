To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

Given the information provided:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the male population in the city is 15%)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.42

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.2857}
