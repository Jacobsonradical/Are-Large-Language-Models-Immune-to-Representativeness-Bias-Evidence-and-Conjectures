To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time when the person is male)
- P(B|~A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identified gender 20% of the time when the person is female)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
