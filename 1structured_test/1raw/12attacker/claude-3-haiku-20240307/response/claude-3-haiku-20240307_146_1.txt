To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's gender given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is male in the population)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is female in the population)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.5263

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.5263}
