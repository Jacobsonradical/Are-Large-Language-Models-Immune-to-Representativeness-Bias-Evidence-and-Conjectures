To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's gender given the witness's identification and the population statistics.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
        = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
        = 0.12 + 0.17
        = 0.29

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.413

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.413}
