Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the information given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the population is 85% female)
  - P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.32

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.375

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.375}
