To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population is female and 15% is male (a priori probabilities).
- A witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the a priori probability that the attacker is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the a priori probability that the attacker is female)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.4138 or approximately 41.38%.
