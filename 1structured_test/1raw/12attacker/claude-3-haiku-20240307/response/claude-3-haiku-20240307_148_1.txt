To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the event (attacker is male) and the evidence (witness identification).

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
- The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is male.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
P(A) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is male)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
