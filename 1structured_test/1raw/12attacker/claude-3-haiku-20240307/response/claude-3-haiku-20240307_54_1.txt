To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following probabilities:

P(M) = Probability that the attacker is male
P(F) = Probability that the attacker is female
P(W|M) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male
P(W|F) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male

Given the information provided:
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(M|W) = 0.48 / (0.48 + 0.17)
P(M|W) = 0.48 / 0.65
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.74

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.74}
