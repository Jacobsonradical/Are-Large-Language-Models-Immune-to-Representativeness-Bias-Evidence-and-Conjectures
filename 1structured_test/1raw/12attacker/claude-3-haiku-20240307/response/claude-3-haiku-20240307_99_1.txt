To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the population is 85% female)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4444 or 44.44%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4444}
