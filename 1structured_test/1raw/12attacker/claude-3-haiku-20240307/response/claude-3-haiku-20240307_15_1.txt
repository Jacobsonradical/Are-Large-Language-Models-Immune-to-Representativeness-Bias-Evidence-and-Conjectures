To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
- A witness identified the attacker as male, and the court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's gender under similar conditions. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- M: the attacker is male
- F: the attacker is female
- W: the witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Where:
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male 80% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male 20% of the time)
- P(F) = 0.85 (the population is 85% female)

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.414}
