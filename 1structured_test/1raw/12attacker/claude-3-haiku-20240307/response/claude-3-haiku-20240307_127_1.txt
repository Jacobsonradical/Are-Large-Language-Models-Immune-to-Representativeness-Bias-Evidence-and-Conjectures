To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's gender given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

Given the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the percentage of males in the population)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4615}
