To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.22

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.22 = 0.545

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.545}
