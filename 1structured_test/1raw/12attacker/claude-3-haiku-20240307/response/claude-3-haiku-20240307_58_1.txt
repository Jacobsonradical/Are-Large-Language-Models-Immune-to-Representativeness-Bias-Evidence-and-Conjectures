To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker as male

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where P(B) can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.27

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.27 = 0.4444

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4444}
