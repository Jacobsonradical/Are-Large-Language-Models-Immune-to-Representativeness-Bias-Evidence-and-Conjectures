Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of males in the population)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of females in the population)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
