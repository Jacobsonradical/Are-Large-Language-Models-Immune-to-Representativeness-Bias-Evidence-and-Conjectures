To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. (P(A) = 0.15)
- A witness identified the attacker as male. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. (P(B|A) = 0.8)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
