To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is male as "M" and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male as "W".

Given information:
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male 20% of the time, where F represents the event that the attacker is female)
- P(M) = 0.15 (the probability that a person in the city is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (the probability that a person in the city is female)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.4706

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4706}
