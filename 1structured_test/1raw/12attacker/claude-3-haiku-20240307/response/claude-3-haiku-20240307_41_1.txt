To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male (a).
- A witness identified the attacker as male (b).
- The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases (b).

Let's define the following events:
- M: The attacker is male.
- F: The attacker is female.
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Substituting the given values:
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
P(W|M) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male 80% of the time)
P(W|F) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male 20% of the time)

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(M|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.414}
