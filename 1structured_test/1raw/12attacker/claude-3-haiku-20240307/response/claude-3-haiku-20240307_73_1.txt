To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as male.
- The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified them as male:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is female)

Plugging in the values:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.42
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.2857}
