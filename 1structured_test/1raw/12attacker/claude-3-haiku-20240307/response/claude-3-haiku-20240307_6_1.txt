To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's gender given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- M: the attacker is male
- F: the attacker is female
- W: the witness identifies the attacker as male

Given the information provided:
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male as male 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (the population is 85% female)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(M|W) = 0.45 / (0.45 + 0.17)
P(M|W) = 0.45 / 0.62
P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.73

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.73}
