To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification, to the prior probability of the attacker being male and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male is 15% based on the population)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male 20% of the time)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker being female is 85% based on the population)

Plugging in the values:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.42

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.2857}
