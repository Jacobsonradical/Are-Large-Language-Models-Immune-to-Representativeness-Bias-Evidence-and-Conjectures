To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as male.
- The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.
- 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
         = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
