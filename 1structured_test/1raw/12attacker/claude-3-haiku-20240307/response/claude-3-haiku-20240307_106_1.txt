To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's gender and the witness's identification.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
- The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male. This is given as 80%.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 15% (from the given information).
- P(B) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.42

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is:

{probability: 0.2857}
