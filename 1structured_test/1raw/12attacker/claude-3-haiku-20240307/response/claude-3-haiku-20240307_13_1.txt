Given the information provided:
a) A witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time, and erred in 20% of the cases.
b) The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
       = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29

Plugging these values into the formula:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
