To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following probabilities:
- P(A) = Probability that the attacker is male
- P(B) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male

Given information:
- 85% of the population is female, and 15% is male.
- The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male. This is 80%, as stated in the problem.
- P(A) = Probability that the attacker is male. This is 15%, as stated in the problem.
- P(B) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases:
1. The attacker is male, and the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male: P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
2. The attacker is female, and the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male: P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Plugging the values into Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
