To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which combines the prior probability and the likelihood of the evidence.

Given information:
- A witness identified the attacker as male, and the witness's ability to correctly identify gender is 80% (true positive rate).
- The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's define the following events:
- M: the attacker is male
- F: the attacker is female

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification:

P(M|witness) = (P(witness|M) * P(M)) / (P(witness|M) * P(M) + P(witness|F) * P(F))

Where:
- P(witness|M) = 0.8 (the true positive rate)
- P(M) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male)
- P(witness|F) = 0.2 (the false positive rate, which is 1 - the true positive rate)
- P(F) = 0.85 (the prior probability of the attacker being female)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(M|witness) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4615}
