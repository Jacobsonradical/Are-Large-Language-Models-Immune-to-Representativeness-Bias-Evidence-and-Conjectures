To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's gender given the witness's identification.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male attacker 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
       = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.4138}
