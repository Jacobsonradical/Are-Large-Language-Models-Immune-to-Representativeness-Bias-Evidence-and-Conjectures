To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker is male
- B: the witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male, based on the population distribution)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is female)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.42

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.2857}
