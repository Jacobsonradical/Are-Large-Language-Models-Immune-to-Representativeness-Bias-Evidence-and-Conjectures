Given the information provided:

a) A witness identified the attacker as male. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's gender under similar conditions, and the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
b) The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(male | witness identified as male) = (P(witness identified as male | male) * P(male)) / P(witness identified as male)

Where:
- P(witness identified as male | male) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying males)
- P(male) = 0.15 (the proportion of males in the population)
- P(witness identified as male) = (P(witness identified as male | male) * P(male)) + (P(witness identified as male | female) * P(female))
  - P(witness identified as male | female) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate in identifying females as males)
  - P(female) = 0.85 (the proportion of females in the population)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(witness identified as male) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.41

P(male | witness identified as male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.41 = 0.29

{probability: 0.29}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 or 29%.
