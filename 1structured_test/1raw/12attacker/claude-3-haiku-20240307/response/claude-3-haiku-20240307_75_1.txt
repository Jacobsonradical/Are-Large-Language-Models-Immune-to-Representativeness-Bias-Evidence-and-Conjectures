To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker is male
- B: the witness identified the attacker as male

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male, as 15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker as male)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
