To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
- A witness identified the attacker as male.
- The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|A') * P(A'))
  - P(B|A') = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male)
  - P(A') = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is female)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.4138.
