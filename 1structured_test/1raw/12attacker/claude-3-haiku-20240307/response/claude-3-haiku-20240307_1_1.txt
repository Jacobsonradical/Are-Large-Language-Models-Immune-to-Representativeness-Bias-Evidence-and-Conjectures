To calculate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male. This is 0.8 (80% correct identification).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (15% of the population is male).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.34

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.34 = 0.35

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.35}
