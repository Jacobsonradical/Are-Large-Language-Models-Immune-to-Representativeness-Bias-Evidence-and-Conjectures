Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

We are interested in the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male. This is 80% (0.8) based on the information provided.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 15% (0.15) based on the given population statistics.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.38

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem equation, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.316

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.316}
