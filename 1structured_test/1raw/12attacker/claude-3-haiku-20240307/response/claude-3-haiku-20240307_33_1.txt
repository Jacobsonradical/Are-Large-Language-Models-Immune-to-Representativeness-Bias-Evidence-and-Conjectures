To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of males in the population)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male as male)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.6 / (0.6 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.6 / 0.77
P(A|B) = 0.7792

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.7792}
