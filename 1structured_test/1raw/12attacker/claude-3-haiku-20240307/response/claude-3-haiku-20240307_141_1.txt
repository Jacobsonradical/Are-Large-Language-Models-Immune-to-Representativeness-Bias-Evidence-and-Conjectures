To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker is male
- B: the witness identified the attacker as male

Given the information provided, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.46

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.46 = 0.26

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.26}
