To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's gender and the witness's identification.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
- A witness identified the attacker as male.
- The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male)
  - P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.32

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.375

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.375}
