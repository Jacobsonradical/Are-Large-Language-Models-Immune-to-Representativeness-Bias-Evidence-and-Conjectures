To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A = the attacker is male
- B = the witness identified the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the gender as male 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identified the gender as male 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Calculating the probabilities:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
