To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
- A witness identified the attacker as male.
- The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the events:
- A: the attacker is male
- B: the witness identifies the attacker as male

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male)
P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of males in the population)
P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
