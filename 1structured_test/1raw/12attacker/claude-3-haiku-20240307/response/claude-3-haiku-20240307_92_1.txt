To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

Given the information provided:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male, given the population distribution)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.47

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.47.
