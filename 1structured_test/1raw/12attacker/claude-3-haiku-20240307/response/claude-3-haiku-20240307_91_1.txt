To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the attacker is male
- B: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male)

Applying Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4706

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4706.
