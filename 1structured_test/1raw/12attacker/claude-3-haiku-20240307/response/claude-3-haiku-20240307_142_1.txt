To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is male.
B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

Given the information provided:
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is male)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.6 / (0.6 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.78

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.78}
