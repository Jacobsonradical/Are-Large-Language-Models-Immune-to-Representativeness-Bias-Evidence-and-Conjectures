To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's gender given the witness's identification.

Given information:
- A witness identified the attacker as male.
- The witness correctly identified gender in 80% of cases and erred in 20% of cases.
- The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time).
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (the population is 15% male).
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as male, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.35

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.3429

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.3429}
