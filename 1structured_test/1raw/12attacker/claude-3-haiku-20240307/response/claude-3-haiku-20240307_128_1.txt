To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Given:
- A witness identified the attacker as male.
- The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is male.
- P(B) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

Plugging in the values:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.37 (the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male)

Calculating P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.37 = 0.324

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.324}
