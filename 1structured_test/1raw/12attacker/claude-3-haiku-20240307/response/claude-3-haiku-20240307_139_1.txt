To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is male.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of males in the population is 15%)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male 20% of the time)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of females in the population is 85%)
  - P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.38

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.3158

{probability: 0.3158}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.3158 or approximately 31.58%.
