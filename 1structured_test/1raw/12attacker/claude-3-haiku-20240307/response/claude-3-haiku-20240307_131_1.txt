To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male.
- A witness identified the attacker as male, and the court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's gender under similar conditions, where the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as male

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability of the attacker being male)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.38 (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.315

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.315}
