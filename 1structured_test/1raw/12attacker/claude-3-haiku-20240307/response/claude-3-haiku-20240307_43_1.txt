To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender.

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time for male attackers)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases for female attackers)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population is 15% male)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the population is 85% female)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4545 or 45.45%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4545}
