Given the information provided:

a) A witness identified the attacker as male, and the court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's gender under similar conditions. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
b) The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(male | witness identified male) = (P(witness identifies male | male) * P(male)) / P(witness identifies male)

Where:
- P(witness identifies male | male) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(male) = 0.15 (the proportion of males in the population)
- P(witness identifies male) = (P(witness identifies male | male) * P(male)) + (P(witness identifies male | female) * P(female))
  - P(witness identifies male | female) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
  - P(female) = 0.85 (the proportion of females in the population)
  - P(witness identifies male) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.34

Plugging in the values:
P(male | witness identified male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.34 = 0.3529

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.3529}
