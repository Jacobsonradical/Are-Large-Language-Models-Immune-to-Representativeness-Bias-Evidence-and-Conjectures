To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of males in the population)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.4615.

The answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.4615}
