To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male
- B: The witness identified the attacker as male

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the gender as male 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identified the gender as male 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.4138}
