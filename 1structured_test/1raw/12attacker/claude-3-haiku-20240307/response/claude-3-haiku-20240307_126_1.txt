To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's gender and the witness's observation.

Given information:
- A witness correctly identified the attacker's gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The population in the city is 85% female and 15% male.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is male.
- B: The witness correctly identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the population in the city is 15% male)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as male 20% of the time)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the population in the city is 85% female)
  - P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.429

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is:

{probability: 0.429}
