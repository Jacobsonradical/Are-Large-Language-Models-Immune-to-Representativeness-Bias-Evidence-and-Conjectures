To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We are given:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(W|not M) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M))

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
