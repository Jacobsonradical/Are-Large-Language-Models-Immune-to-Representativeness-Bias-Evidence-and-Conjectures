To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We need to calculate P(M|W), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the given information:
- P(M) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being male)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a male)
- P(W|not M) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) × P(M)) / (P(W|M) × P(M) + P(W|not M) × P(not M))

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
