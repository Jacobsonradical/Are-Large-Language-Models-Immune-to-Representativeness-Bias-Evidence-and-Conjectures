To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We need to calculate P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / P(W)

Given:
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (the probability of being male in the city's population)
- P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)
  - P(W|not M) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time)
  - P(not M) = 0.85 (the probability of being female in the city's population)

Calculate P(W):
P(W) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(M|W):
P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
