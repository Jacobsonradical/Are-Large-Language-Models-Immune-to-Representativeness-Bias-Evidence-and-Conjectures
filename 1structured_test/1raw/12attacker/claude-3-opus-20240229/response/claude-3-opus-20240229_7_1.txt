To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

We need to calculate P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(M|W) = (P(W|M) × P(M)) / P(W)

Given:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(W|not M) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time)

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|M) × P(M) + P(W|not M) × P(not M)
     = 0.80 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(M|W):
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) × P(M)) / P(W)
       = (0.80 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
