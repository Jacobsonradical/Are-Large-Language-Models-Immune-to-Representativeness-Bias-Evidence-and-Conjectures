To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- M: the attacker is male
- W: the witness identified the attacker as male

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(M) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person in the city is male)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male)
- P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * (1 - P(M)))

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
