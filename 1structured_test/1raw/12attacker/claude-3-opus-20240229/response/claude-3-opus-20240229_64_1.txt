To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

Given:
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
- P(W|not M) = 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(not M) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M))

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
