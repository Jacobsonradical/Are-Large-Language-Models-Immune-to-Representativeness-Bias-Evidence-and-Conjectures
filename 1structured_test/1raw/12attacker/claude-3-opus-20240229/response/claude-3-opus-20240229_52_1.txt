To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

M: The attacker is male
W: The witness identified the attacker as male

Given:
P(M) = 0.15 (the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is male)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker)
P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
       = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city, is approximately 0.4138.
