To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

Given:
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(W|not M) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (the probability of being male in the city's population)

We want to calculate P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
       = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
       = 0.12 / 0.29
