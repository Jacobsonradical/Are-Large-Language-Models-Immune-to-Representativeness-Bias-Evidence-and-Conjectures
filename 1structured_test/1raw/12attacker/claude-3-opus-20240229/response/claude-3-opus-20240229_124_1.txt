To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- P(M): The probability that the attacker is male
- P(F): The probability that the attacker is female
- P(W|M): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male
- P(W|F): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female

Given:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore,

{probability: 0.4138}
