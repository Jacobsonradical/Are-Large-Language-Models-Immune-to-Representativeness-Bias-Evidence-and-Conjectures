To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

M: The attacker is male
W: The witness identified the attacker as male

From the given information:
P(M) = 0.15 (probability of being male in the city)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a male)
P(W|not M) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M))

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
