To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(W) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We know:
- P(M) = 0.15 (given in information b)
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (probability of witness correctly identifying a male, given in information a)
- P(W|not M) = 0.20 (probability of witness incorrectly identifying a female as male, given in information a)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
       = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
       = 0.12 / 0.29
