To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

Given:
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(W|not M) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (the probability of a randomly selected person being male is 15%)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M))

P(not M) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the gender distribution in the city, is approximately 0.4138.
