To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male, and P(W|M) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male.

From the information given:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time, i.e., identifying a female as male)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) × P(M)) / (P(W|M) × P(M) + P(W|F) × P(F))

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the population data, is approximately 0.4138.
