To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

Given:
- P(W|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability of a person being male in the city is 15%)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
