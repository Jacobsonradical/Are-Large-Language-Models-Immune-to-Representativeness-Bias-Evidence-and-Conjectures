To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- M: The attacker is male
- W: The witness identified the attacker as male

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

From the given information:
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the city population is male)
- P(W|not M) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
- P(not M) = 0.85 (85% of the city population is female)

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
       = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
       = 0.12 / 0.29
