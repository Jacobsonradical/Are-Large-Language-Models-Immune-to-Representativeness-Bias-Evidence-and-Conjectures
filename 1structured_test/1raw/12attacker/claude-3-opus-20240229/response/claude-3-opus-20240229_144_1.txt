To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- P(M): The probability that the attacker is male
- P(W): The probability that the attacker is female
- P(I|M): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male
- P(I|F): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female

From the given information:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)
- P(I|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
- P(I|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|I) = (P(I|M) * P(M)) / (P(I|M) * P(M) + P(I|F) * P(W))

Plugging in the values:

P(M|I) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
