To estimate the probability that the attacker is male given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is male as M, and the event that the witness identified the attacker as male as W.

We need to calculate P(M|W), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Given:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W|M) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
- P(W|not M) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M))

P(not M) = 1 - P(M) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
