To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- P(M) = probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) = probability that the attacker is female
- P(W|M) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male
- P(W|F) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, given that the attacker is female

From the given information:
- P(M) = 0.15
- P(F) = 0.85
- P(W|M) = 0.80
- P(W|F) = 0.20

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = (P(W|M) * P(M)) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
