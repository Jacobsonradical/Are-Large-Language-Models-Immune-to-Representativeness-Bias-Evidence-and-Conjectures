{probability: 0.5167, given the information, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 51.67%}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time.
2. We also know that 85% of the population in the city is female, while 15% is male.
3. Let's assume that the attacker was chosen randomly from the population. In this case, the initial probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.
4. Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can update our probability using Bayes' theorem.
5. The updated probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / [(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)] = 0.5167.
6. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 51.67%.
