Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male.

First, we calculate the prior probability of the attacker being male, given that 85% of the city's population is female and 15% is male. So, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.

Next, we calculate the likelihood that the witness would identify the attacker as male if the attacker is indeed male. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the likelihood is 0.8.

Then, we calculate the likelihood that the witness would identify the attacker as male if the attacker is actually female. Given that the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases, the likelihood is 0.2.

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:

P(Male|Witness) = [P(Witness|Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Witness|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness|Female) * P(Female)]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(Male|Witness) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.47

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.47.
