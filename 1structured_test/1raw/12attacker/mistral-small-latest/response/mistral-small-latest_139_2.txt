{probability: 0.68, The probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.68, or 68%.}

Here's the reasoning:
1. First, let's consider the base rate of males in the city, which is 15%.
2. The witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying gender. So, if the attacker is male, there is an 80% chance the witness will correctly identify them as male.
3. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male and the witness correctly identifying them as male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%.
4. If the attacker is female, there is a 20% chance the witness will incorrectly identify them as male. Given the base rate of females is 85%, the probability of a female attacker being misidentified as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17, or 17%.
5. Adding these two probabilities, the overall probability that the attacker is male (either correctly identified or misidentified) is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.68, or approximately 68%.
