{probability: 0.66,

This is a Bayesian probability problem. Let's break it down:

1. Prior probability (P(M)) of the attacker being male is 0.15 based on the city's population.
2. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male (P(W|M)) is 0.8.
3. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male (P(W|F)) is 0.1 (since the witness is equally likely to make mistakes for males and females).
4. We want to find the posterior probability P(M|W) (the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male).
5. Using Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)].
6. Plugging in the values, we get P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.66.
