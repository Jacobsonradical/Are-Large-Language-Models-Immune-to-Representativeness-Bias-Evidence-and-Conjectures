{probability: 0.6462, explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem. Let M be the event that the attacker is male and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We are looking for P(M|W), which by Bayes' theorem is P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W).

From the information given, P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time). P(M) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female).

To find P(W), we need to consider both correct and incorrect identifications: P(W) = P(W|M)*P(M) + P(W|not M)*P(not M) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.22.

So, P(M|W) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.22 = 0.6462.}
