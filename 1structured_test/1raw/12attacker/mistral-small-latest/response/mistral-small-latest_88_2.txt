{probability: 0.78, The probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.78 or 78%.}

Here's the reasoning:
1. First, we need to find the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male given that the person is indeed male. This is calculated as the witness's accuracy rate of 80%, which is 0.8.
2. Next, we need to consider the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 15% or 0.15, given the population distribution in the city.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. This is calculated as (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.78.
4. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.78 or 78%.
