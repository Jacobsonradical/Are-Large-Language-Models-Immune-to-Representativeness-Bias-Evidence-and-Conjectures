{probability: 0.62, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population). The probability of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The probability of the witness identifying a female as male is 0.1 (20% error rate * 0.5 probability of the attacker being female). So, the posterior probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.1)) = 0.62.}
