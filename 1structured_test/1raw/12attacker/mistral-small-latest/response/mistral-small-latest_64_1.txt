{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, the base rate for a random person being male is 0.15. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate for identifying males under those conditions, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness can also misidentify a female attacker as male. Since 85% of the population is female, and the witness has a 20% error rate for females, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (incorrect identification) = 0.72.}
