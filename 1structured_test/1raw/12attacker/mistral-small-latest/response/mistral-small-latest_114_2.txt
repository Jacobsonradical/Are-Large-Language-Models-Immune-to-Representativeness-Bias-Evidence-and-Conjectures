Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let M represent the event that the attacker is male, and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

From the information in "a", P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time).

From the information in "b", P(M) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female, so 15% is male).

To find P(W), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is male or the attacker is female.

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)

Since 85% of the population is female, P(not M) = 0.85.

From the information in "a", if the attacker is female, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as male with a probability of 0.2 (the witness's error rate). So, P(W|not M) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get:

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, substituting into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41.
