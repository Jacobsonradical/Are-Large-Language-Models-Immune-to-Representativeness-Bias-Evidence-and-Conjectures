{probability: 0.84 or 84%, rounded to the nearest whole number for clarity}

Explanation:
1. We start with the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 15% (given information "a").
2. Then, we consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender, which is 80% for male individuals (given information "b").
3. To find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male, we can use Bayes' theorem:
   P(male|witness says male) = [P(witness says male|male) * P(male)] / P(witness says male)
4. P(witness says male) = P(witness says male|male) * P(male) + P(witness says male|female) * P(female)
   P(witness says male|female) is the error rate when the person is actually female, which is 20% since half of the witness's errors are identifying females as males.
5. So, P(witness says male) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
6. Now we can calculate P(male|witness says male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.84 or 84%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 84%.
