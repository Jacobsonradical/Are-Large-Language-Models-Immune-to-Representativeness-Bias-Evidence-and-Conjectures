{probability: 0.69, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is male given the population distribution is 0.15. The likelihood that the witness would identify the attacker as male given that they are indeed male is 0.8. The likelihood that the witness would identify the attacker as male given that they are female is 0.2. So, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as such is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.69.}
