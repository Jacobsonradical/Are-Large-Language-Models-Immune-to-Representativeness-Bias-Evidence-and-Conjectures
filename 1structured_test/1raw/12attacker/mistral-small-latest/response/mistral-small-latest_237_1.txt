{probability: 0.659, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is approximately 0.659. This is calculated by multiplying the base rate of males (0.15) by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male (0.8), and dividing by the sum of the products of the base rate and the corresponding probabilities of the witness being correct (0.15*0.8) + (0.85*0.2).}
