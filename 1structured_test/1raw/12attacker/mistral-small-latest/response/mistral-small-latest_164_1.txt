{probability: 0.89, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The probability of the witness reporting a male given that the attacker is male is thus 0.15*0.8 = 0.12. The probability of the witness reporting a male given that the attacker is female is 0.85*0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.89.}
