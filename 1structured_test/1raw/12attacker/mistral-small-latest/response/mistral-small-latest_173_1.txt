{probability: 0.64, explanation: The probability that the attacker is male can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. First, calculate the prior probability of the attacker being male (15% of the population, or 0.15). Then, consider the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker given that the attacker is indeed male (80% or 0.8). Finally, multiply these two probabilities to get the posterior probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we must also account for the possibility that the witness misidentified a female attacker. The probability of this happening is the probability of a female attacker (0.85) multiplied by the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male (20% or 0.2). This gives us 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together and dividing by the total probability of any witness observation (0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29), we get our final estimate: 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.64.}
