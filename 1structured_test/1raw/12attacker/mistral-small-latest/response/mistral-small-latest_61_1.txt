{probability: 0.66, explanation: Given the witness's accuracy and the population distribution, the probability can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The witness's accuracy in identifying males is 0.8 (80%). The prior probability of a male attacker is 0.15 (15% of the population). So, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.66.}
