{probability: 0.753}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. So if the attacker was actually male, the witness has an 80% chance of reporting it correctly.
2. Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the base rate for the attacker being male is 0.15.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's report, is calculated as follows: P(male|report) = P(report|male) * P(male) / P(report)
4. P(report) is the probability of the witness reporting that the attacker is male, regardless of the actual gender. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker and incorrectly identifying a female attacker: P(report) = P(report|male) * P(male) + P(report|female) * P(female) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22
5. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(male|report) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.753
