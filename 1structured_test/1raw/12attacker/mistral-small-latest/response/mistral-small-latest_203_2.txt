{probability: 0.87, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification. The prior probability (P(M)) that the attacker is male is 0.15, based on the population distribution in the city. The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker (P(W|M)) is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male (P(W|F)) is 0.1 (since half of the errors are identifying females as males). The probability that the attacker is female given the witness's identification (P(F|W)) can also be calculated. Finally, we can find the posterior probability P(M|W) = P(M) * P(W|M) / (P(M) * P(W|M) + P(F) * P(W|F)) = 0.87.}
