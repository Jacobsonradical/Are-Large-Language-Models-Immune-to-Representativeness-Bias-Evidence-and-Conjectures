{probability: 0.88,

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This is our prior probability.
2. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time under similar conditions. So, if the attacker was indeed male, there's an 80% chance the witness would correctly identify them as such.
3. We can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem: P(Male|Witness says male) = [P(Witness says male|Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says male)
4. P(Witness says male) = P(Witness says male|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness says male|Female) * P(Female)
5. Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time, P(Witness says male|Female) = 0.20
6. Substituting the values, P(Male|Witness says male) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85] = 0.88

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.88.
