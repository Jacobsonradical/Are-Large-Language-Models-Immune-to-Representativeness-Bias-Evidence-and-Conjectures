{probability: 0.92, The base rate of males in the city is 15% or 0.15. Given the witness's accuracy rate of 80% or 0.80, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17. However, the witness did identify the attacker as male, so we only consider the two possible scenarios where the attacker is male. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.92 or 92%.}
