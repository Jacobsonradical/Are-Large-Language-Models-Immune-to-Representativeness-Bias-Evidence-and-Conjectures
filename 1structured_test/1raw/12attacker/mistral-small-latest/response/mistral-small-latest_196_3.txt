{probability: 0.64,

Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. We first need to find the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male given that the actual person is male. This is 0.8 (80%). Then we multiply this by the probability that the attacker is male, given the population distribution. This is 0.15 (15%). So, the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identified him as such is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. This is the numerator of our probability. The denominator is the sum of the probabilities that the witness correctly identifies a male and incorrectly identifies a female as a male. The probability of the latter is 0.85 (85% of the population is female) times 0.2 (20% error rate for the witness). So, the denominator is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified him as such, is 0.12 / 0.29 = approximately 0.64.}
