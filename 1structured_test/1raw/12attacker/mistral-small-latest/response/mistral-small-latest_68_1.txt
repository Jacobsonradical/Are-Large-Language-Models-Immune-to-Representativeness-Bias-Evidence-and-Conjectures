{probability: 0.74, The probability that the attacker is male, given the information provided, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male, given that 85% of the population is female, is 0.15. The likelihood that a male attacker would be identified as male by the witness is 0.8. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.74.}
