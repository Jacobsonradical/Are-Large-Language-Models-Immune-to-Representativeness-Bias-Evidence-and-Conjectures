{probability: 0.88, explanation: This is a Bayes' theorem problem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood that the witness would identify a male as male is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The probability that the witness would identify a female as male is 0.1 (20% error rate * 0.5, since the witness is equally likely to make this error for either gender). So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.1) = 0.88.}
