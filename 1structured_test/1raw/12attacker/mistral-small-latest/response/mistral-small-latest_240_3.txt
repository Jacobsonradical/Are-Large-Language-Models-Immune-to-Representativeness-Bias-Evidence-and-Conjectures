{probability: 0.88, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, and the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, we can calculate the estimated probability that the attacker is male as follows.

First, let's find the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male attacker: 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12.
Next, let's find the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a female attacker as male: 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

The total probability of the witness identifying a male attacker is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

However, we are given that the witness identified the attacker as male. This means we need to calculate the conditional probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified them as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find this probability: P(male|witness says male) = P(witness says male|male) * P(male) / P(witness says male)

Plugging in the values, we get: (0.12 / 0.29) * 0.15 = 0.88.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.88.}
