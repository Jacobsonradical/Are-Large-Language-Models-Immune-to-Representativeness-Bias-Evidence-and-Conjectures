{probability: 0.94,

Explanation:

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement.

1. Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.
2. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
3. Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
4. From the given information, P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is male, given the city's population distribution).
5. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender as male, given that the attacker is male. This is 0.8 (80% accuracy), as per the witness's identification abilities.
6. To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is male and female. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
7. P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is female, which is 0.85.
8. P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male. This is the error rate, which is 0.2 (20%).
9. Plugging in the values, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
10. Finally, P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.94

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.94.}
