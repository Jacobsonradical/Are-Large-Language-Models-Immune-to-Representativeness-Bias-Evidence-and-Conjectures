{probability: 0.74, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem, which takes into account both the witness' reliability and the gender distribution in the city. The prior probability (before the witness' statement) that the attacker is male is 0.15, the likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8, and the likelihood of the witness identifying a female as male is 0.1. So, the posterior probability (after the witness' statement) that the attacker is male is approximately 0.74.}
