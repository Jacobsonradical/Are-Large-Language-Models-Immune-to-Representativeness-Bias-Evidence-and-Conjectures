{probability: 0.6875}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume the base rate of male attackers is the same as the population ratio, which is 0.15.
2. The witness's accuracy rate in identifying gender is 80% (or 0.8).
3. If the attacker is male, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker's gender correctly is 0.8.
4. If the attacker is female, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's gender as male is 0.2 (the error rate).
5. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male: P(male|witness says male) = [P(witness says male|male) * P(male)] / [P(witness says male|male) * P(male) + P(witness says male|female) * P(female)].
6. Plugging in the values, we get: [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.012 / (0.012 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.6875.
