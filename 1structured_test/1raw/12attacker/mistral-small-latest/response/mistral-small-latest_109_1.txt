{probability: 0.625}

This is a Bayesian probability problem. Let's break it down:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. This is the witness's accuracy.
2. We also know that 85% of the population in the city is female, and 15% is male. This is the prior probability of the attacker being male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability (the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male):

Posterior probability = (Prior probability * Accuracy) / (Prior probability * Accuracy + (1 - Prior probability) * (1 - Accuracy))

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior probability = (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.625

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.625.
