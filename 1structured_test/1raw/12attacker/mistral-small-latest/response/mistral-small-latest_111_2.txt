Based on the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
- P(M) as the probability of the attacker being male
- P(F) as the probability of the attacker being female
- P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is male
- P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female
- P(W) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male

From the information, we have:
- P(M) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female)
- P(F) = 0.85
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time)

We can calculate P(W) using total probability law: P(W) = P(W|M)P(M) + P(W|F)P(F) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.23

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(M|W), the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male: P(M|W) = P(W|M)P(M) / P(W) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.52

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.52.
