{probability: 0.765, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, the base rate of a male attacker is 0.15. The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender as male. Given the witness's 80% accuracy in gender identification, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is indeed male. However, there is also a 20% chance that the attacker is female, but the witness made an error. Taking these factors into account, the probability of the attacker being male is calculated as follows:
0.15 (base rate of male attacker) * 0.80 (witness accuracy) + 0.85 (base rate of female attacker) * 0.20 (witness error rate) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.765 or 76.5%}
