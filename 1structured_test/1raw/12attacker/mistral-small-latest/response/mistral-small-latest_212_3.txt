{probability: 0.78, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. The witness correctly identified the attacker's gender with a probability of 0.8, so the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that he is male is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability of the attacker being male is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.78.}
