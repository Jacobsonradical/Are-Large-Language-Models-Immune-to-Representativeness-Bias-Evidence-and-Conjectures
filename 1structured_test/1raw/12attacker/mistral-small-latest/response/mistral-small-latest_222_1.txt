{probability: 0.63, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem, which combines the prior probability (85% of the population is female, so 15% is male) with the likelihood of the witness being correct given the attacker's gender (80% accurate for males). The calculated probability is approximately 0.63, or 63%, that the attacker is male.}
