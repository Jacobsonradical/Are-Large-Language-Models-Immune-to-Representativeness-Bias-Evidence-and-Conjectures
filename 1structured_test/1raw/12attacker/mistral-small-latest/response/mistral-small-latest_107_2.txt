{probability: 0.6568, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is approximately 0.6568. This calculation takes into account the prior probability of a male attacker (0.15), the witness's accuracy rate (0.8), and the error rate (0.2).}
