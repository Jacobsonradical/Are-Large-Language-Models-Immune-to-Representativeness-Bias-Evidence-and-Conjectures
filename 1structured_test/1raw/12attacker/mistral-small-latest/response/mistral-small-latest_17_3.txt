{probability: 0.74, Explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification can be calculated. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female is 0.2 (since the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases). So, the posterior probability is (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.74.}
