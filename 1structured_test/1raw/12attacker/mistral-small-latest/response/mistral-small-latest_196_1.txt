{probability: 0.86, or 86%}

Here's the reasoning:
1. First, we need to find the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender, given that the attacker is male.
2. According to the given information, the witness correctly identifies the gender of a male in 80% of the cases. So, the probability of the witness being correct if the attacker is male is 0.8.
3. Now, we need to take into account the gender distribution in the city. 85% of the population is female, so only 15% is male.
4. Applying Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is: (probability of witness being correct | attacker is male) * (prior probability of attacker being male) / (total probability of witness identifying a male).
5. The total probability of witness identifying a male includes both the cases where the witness is correct (15% of the population * 80% correct identification) and the cases where the witness makes a mistake (85% of the population * 20% error in identifying male).
6. So, the total probability of witness identifying a male is 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.21.
7. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.21 â‰ˆ 0.86 or 86%.
