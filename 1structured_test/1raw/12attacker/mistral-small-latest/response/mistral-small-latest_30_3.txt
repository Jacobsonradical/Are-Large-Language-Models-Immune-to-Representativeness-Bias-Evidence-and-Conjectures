{probability: 0.63, This is based on Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population). Given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male (with a likelihood of 0.8 for males), the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.63.}
