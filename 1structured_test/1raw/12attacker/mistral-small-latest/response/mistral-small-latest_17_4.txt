{probability: 0.58, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male can be calculated as follows: P(male|witness) = P(witness|male) * P(male) / P(witness). P(witness|male) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker as male 80% of the time). P(male) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female, so 15% is male). P(witness) can be calculated as P(witness|male) * P(male) + P(witness|female) * P(female) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.28. So, P(male|witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.58.}
