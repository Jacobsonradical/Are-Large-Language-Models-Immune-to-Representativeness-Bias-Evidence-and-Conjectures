Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let's denote M as the event that the attacker is male and W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We know:
- P(M) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female, so 15% is male)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(M|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.418

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.418.
