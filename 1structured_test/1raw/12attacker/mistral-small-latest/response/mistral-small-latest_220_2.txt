{probability: 0.68, The probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.68. This is calculated using Bayes' theorem, taking into account the prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15, given the city's population), the witness's accuracy (0.8 for identifying males correctly), and the witness's error rate (0.2 for mistakenly identifying females as males).}
