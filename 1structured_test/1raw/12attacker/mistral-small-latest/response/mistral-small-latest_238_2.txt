{probability: 0.51, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.51.}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so if the attacker were male, there's an 80% chance the witness would identify them as such.
2. However, given that 85% of the population is female, there's a higher prior probability that a random person would be female.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's testimony: P(male|testimony) = P(testimony|male) * P(male) / P(testimony)
4. P(testimony|male) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy in identifying males)
5. P(male) = 0.15 (proportion of males in the population)
6. P(testimony) = P(testimony|male) * P(male) + P(testimony|female) * P(female)
   - P(testimony|female) is the probability of the witness identifying a female as male, which is 1 - the probability of correctly identifying a female, or 0.2 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time)
   - P(female) = 0.85
   - So P(testimony) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 ≈ 0.27
7. Therefore, P(male|testimony) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.27 ≈ 0.51

So the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.51.
