{probability: 0.64}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Given information b, we know that the base rate of males in the population is 15%.
2. Given information a, we know that the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time. Assuming the witness's accuracy is independent of the gender of the person being identified, this means the witness has a 80% chance of correctly identifying a male.
3. To find the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(male|witness says male) = [P(witness says male|male) * P(male)] / P(witness says male)
4. P(witness says male) = P(witness says male|male) * P(male) + P(witness says male|female) * P(female)
5. Since 80% of the time the witness correctly identifies males and 20% of the time incorrectly identifies females as males, P(witness says male|male) = 0.8 and P(witness says male|female) = 0.2
6. Plugging in the values, we get P(male|witness says male) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.64
