{probability: 0.955,

Explanation:

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

1. Prior probability (P(M)): Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability that a random person is male is 15% or 0.15.
2. Probability of the witness's observation given that the attacker is male (P(W|M)): The witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time, so this probability is 0.8.
3. Probability of the witness's observation given that the attacker is female (P(W|F)): The witness makes an error 20% of the time when the person is actually female, so the probability of the witness saying the attacker is male when they are actually female is 0.2.
4. Prior probability of the attacker being female (P(F)): This is 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values: P(M|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.955

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.955.}
