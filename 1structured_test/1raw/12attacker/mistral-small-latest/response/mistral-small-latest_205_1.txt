Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male.

Let's denote:
M = the event that the attacker is male
W = the event that the witness identified the attacker as male

We know from the problem:
P(M) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

Since P(not M) = 1 - P(M) = 0.85, we can now calculate P(M|W):

P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.42

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is:
{probability: 0.42}
