{probability: 0.67, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification can be calculated. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 due to the population distribution. The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female is 0.2 (the witness's error rate). Therefore, P(male|witness) = [P(witness|male) * P(male)] / [P(witness|male) * P(male) + P(witness|female) * P(female)] = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.67.}
