{probability: 0.875}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female and 15% is male. This is our prior probability.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. So, if the attacker was male, the witness has an 80% chance of identifying him correctly.
3. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness might incorrectly identify a female attacker as male. Given that 85% of the population is female, and the witness has a 20% error rate for females, there's a 0.17 (0.85 * 0.20) probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female as male.
4. To calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, we use Bayes' theorem. The probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male (P(male|witness)) is equal to the probability of the witness identifying a male as male (P(witness|male)) times the prior probability of the attacker being male (P(male)), divided by the total probability of the witness identifying anyone as male (P(witness)).
5. So, P(male|witness) = (P(witness|male) * P(male)) / (P(witness|male) * P(male) + P(witness|female) * P(female)).
6. Plugging in the numbers, we get: (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)) = 0.875.
