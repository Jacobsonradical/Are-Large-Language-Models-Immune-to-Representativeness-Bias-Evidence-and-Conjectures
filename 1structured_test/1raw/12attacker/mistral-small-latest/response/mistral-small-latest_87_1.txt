{probability: 0.58, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem. Given the prior probability of a male attacker (0.15), the witness's accuracy in identifying gender under similar conditions (0.8), and the fact that the witness identified the attacker as male, the posterior probability of the attacker being male is approximately 0.58.}
