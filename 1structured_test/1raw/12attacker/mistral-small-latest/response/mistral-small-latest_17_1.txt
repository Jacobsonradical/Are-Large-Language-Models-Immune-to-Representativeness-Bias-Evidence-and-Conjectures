{probability: 0.536, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (given information b). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 (given information a). So, the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker given that the attacker is male is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of their actual gender, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male is 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.536.}
