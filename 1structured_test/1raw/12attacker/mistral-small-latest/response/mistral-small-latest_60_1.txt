Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male
- F as the event that the attacker is female
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

From the information, we have:
- P(M) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male)
- P(F) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:
P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.264

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.264.

Answer: {probability: 0.264}
