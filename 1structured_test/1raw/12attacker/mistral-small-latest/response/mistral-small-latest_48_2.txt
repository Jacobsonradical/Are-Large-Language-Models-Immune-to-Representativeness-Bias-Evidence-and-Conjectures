{probability: 0.68, Given that 85% of the population is female, there's an initial probability of 0.15 that the attacker is male. However, the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time in similar conditions, so the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. But we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error and identified a female attacker as male. Given that 85% of the population is female, the probability of a false positive is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. So, the total probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (false positive) = 0.68}
