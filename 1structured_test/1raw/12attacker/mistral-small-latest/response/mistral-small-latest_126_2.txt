{probability: 0.756, The probability that the attacker is male can be calculated by first finding the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is male, and then multiplying that by the base rate of males in the city. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability that the witness is correct when the attacker is male is 0.8. Multiply this by the base rate of males in the city, which is 0.15, we get 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness is incorrect and incorrectly identified a female as male. The probability that the witness is incorrect given that the attacker is female is 0.2, and the base rate of females is 0.85. So, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification and the city's population, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.756.}
