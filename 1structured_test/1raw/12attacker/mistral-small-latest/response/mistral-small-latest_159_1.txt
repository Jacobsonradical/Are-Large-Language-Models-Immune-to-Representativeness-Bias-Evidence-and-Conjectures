{probability: 0.62, explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem. First, we need to find the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male, and the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is female. Let's denote these as P(Witness|Male) and P(Witness|Female), respectively.

From the information in "a", we know P(Witness|Male) = 0.8 and P(Witness|Female) = 0.2.

The probability of the attacker being male or female in the city is given in "b": P(Male) = 0.15 and P(Female) = 0.85.

We want to find P(Male|Witness), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows: P(Male|Witness) = [P(Witness|Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Witness|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness|Female) * P(Female)]

Plugging in the numbers, we get: P(Male|Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.62}
