{probability: 0.56, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement can be calculated. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker correctly is 0.8 (from information a). So, the probability that the attacker is male is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.56.}
