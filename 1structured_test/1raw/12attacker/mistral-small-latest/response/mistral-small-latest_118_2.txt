{probability: 0.784, explanation: Given that 85% of the population in the city is female, we start with a prior probability that the attacker is male at 0.15. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time, so we multiply the prior probability by the witness's accuracy rate: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness could also have misidentified a female attacker as male. Given that half the population is female, the probability of the witness misidentifying a female as male is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Combining these two probabilities, we get 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.784, which is our estimate for the probability that the attacker is male.}
