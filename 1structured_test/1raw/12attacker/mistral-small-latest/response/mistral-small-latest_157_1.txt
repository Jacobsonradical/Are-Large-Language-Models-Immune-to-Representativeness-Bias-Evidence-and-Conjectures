{probability: 0.902, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification. Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|W).

First, we need to find P(W|A), which is the probability that the witness identifies a male attacker as male. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, P(W|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(W|not A), which is the probability that the witness identifies a female attacker as male. Since the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases, P(W|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = [P(A) * P(W|A)] / [P(A) * P(W|A) + P(not A) * P(W|not A)].

Given that 85% of the population is female, P(not A) = 0.15. Plugging in the values, we get P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.902.}
