{probability: 0.84, The probability that the attacker is male can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we start with a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is male. The witness correctly identifies gender in 80% of the cases, so the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker as male is 0.8. Combining these probabilities using Bayes' theorem, we get a posterior probability of approximately 0.84 that the attacker is male.}
