{probability: 0.67}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Bayes' theorem can be used to calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population distribution.
2. Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male, P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female, P(W|M) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, and P(W|F) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female.
3. From the information given, P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male), P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time), and P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time).
4. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification P(M|W) is: P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F))
5. Given that P(F) = 1 - P(M) = 0.85, P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.67.
