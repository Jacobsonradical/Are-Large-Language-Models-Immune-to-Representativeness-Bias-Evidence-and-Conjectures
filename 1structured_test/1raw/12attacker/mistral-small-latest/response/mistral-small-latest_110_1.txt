  "probability": 0.48,
  "explanation": "This is a conditional probability problem, which can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event M as the attacker being male, and W as the witness identifying the attacker as male. We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the person as male. According to Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W). 1. P(W|M) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, which is 0.8 (80%). 2. P(M) is the prior probability of the attacker being male, which is 0.15 (15% of the population). 3. P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of their actual gender. This can be calculated as P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F), where P(F) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85 (85% of the population). Since P(W|F) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, it is 0.2 (20%). Plugging in the values, we get P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22. Finally, P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.48"
