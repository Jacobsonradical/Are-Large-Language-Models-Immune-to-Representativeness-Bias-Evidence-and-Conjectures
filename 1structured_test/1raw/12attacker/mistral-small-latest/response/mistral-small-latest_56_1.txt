{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, the base rate for a random person being male is 0.15. The witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying gender, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.72.}
