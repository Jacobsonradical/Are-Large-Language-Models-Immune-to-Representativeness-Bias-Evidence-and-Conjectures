{probability: 0.89, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony. Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We want to find P(M|W).

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

We know P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male).
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time).

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)

Since the witness identifies females correctly 80% of the time as well, P(W|not M) = 0.8. And P(not M) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female).

Plugging these values in, we get:
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Finally, P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8 â‰ˆ 0.89}
