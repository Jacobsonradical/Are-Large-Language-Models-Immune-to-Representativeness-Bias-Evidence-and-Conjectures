{probability: 0.66, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8 (from information a). So, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.66.}
