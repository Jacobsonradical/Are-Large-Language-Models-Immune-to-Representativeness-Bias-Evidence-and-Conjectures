{probability: 0.84, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male, given the city's population distribution, is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker, given that the attacker is actually male, is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate). The likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker, given that the attacker is actually female, is 0.2 (the witness's error rate). So, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's report, is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.84.}
