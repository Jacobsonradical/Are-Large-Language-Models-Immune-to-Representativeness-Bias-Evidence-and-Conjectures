{probability: 0.875, The probability that the attacker is male is 0.875. This is calculated by taking into account the prior probability of a male attacker given the city's population (0.15), and the likelihood ratio of the witness correctly identifying a male given their error rate (0.8/0.1 = 8). The final estimate is calculated by multiplying these two values together: 0.15 * 8 = 0.875.}
