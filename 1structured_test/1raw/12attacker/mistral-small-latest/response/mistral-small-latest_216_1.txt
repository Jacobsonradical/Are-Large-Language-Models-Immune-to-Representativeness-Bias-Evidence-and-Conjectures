{probability: 0.9375, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the probability as follows: P(male|witness says male) = [P(witness says male|male) * P(male)] / P(witness says male). P(witness says male|male) = 0.8 (80% accuracy). P(male) = 0.15 (15% of the population). P(witness says male) = P(witness says male|male) * P(male) + P(witness says male|female) * P(female) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23. Therefore, P(male|witness says male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.9375}
