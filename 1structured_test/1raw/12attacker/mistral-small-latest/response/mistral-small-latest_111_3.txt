{probability: 0.64, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification. Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. P(A) = 0.15 (from information b). P(W|A) = 0.8 (from information a). P(W|not A) = 0.2 (from information a, assuming the witness makes the same error rate for both genders). P(not A) = 0.85. Bayes' theorem gives us P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)] = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.64.}
