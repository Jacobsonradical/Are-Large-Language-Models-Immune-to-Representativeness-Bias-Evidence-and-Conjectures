{probability: 0.88, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (given the population distribution). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female is 0.2 (the witness's error rate). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is male can be calculated as (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.88.}
