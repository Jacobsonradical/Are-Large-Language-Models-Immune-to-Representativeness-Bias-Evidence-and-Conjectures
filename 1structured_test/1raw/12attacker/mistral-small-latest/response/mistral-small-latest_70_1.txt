{probability: 0.89, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification. Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B).

First, calculate the prior probability P(A) using the city population data: P(A) = 0.15. Next, calculate P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies a male as male: P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time for males).

Then, calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies any person as male. This can be found using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.23.

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B): P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.89.}
