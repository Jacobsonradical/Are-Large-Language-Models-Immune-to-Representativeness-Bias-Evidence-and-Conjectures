Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male.

First, let's denote:
- P(M) = the probability that the attacker is male
- P(F) = the probability that the attacker is female
- P(W|M) = the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male
- P(W|F) = the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female
- P(W) = the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male

From the information in b), we have P(M) = 0.15 and P(F) = 0.85.
From the information in a), we have P(W|M) = 0.8 and P(W|F) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23

So, P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.522

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is {probability: 0.522}.
