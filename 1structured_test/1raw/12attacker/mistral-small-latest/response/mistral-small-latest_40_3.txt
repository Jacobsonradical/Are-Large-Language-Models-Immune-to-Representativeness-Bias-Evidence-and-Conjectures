{probability: 0.84, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, the base probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. However, the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time, so we can adjust this probability accordingly. The probability that the male attacker was correctly identified is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The probability that a female was incorrectly identified as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. So, the total probability of the attacker being male is 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (false identification) = 0.84.}
