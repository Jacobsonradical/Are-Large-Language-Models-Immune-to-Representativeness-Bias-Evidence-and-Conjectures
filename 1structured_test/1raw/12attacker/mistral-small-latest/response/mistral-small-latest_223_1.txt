{probability: 0.92, explanation: We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let's denote M as the event that the attacker is male and W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We know that P(M) = 0.15, P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifying a male as male), and P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male). We want to find P(M|W), which represents the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]. Plugging in the values, we get P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.92.}
