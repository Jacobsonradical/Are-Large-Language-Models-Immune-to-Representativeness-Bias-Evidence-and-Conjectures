{probability: 0.68, Explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness testimony can be calculated as follows:

P(male|witness) = P(witness|male) * P(male) / [P(witness|male) * P(male) + P(witness|female) * P(female)]

P(male) = 0.15 (given in the question)
P(witness|male) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time)
P(witness|female) = 0.2 (the witness made an error in 20% of the cases)
P(female) = 0.85 (given in the question)

Substituting these values, we get:

P(male|witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.68}
