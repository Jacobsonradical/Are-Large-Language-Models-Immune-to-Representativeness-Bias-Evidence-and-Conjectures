{probability: 0.5714, explanation: This is a probability question that can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Given the witness's accuracy in identifying gender (80% for males) and the population ratio of males to females (15% males), the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.5714 or 57.14%.}
