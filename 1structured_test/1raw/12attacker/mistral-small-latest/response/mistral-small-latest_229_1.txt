{probability: 0.89, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem, which considers the prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15), the witness's accuracy in identifying gender (0.8), and the population distribution of the city. The calculation results in an estimated probability of the attacker being male at approximately 0.89 or 89%.}
