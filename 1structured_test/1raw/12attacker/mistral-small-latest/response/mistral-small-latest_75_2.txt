{probability: 0.94, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, if we randomly selected a person, there would be a 0.15 probability that they are male. However, we have a witness who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the witness correctly identified the male attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. Since the witness identified the attacker as male, we can conclude that the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.94 (0.12 / (0.12 + 0.06), where 0.06 is the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female as male).}
