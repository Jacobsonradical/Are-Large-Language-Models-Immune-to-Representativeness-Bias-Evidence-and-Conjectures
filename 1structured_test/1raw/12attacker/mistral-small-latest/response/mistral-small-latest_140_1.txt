{probability: 0.56, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, and the attacker is male, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender is 0.8. Given that 85% of the population in the city is female, the prior probability of a random person being male is 0.15. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.56.}
