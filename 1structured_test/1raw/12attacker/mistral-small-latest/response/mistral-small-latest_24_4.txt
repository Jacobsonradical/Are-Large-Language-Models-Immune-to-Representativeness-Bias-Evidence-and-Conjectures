{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, the base probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. However, the witness correctly identified the attacker as male. The witness's accuracy rate is 80% for identifying males. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. But we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in identifying a female attacker as male. Given that 85% of the population is female, the base probability of the attacker being female is 0.85. The witness's error rate for identifying females as males is 20%. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is a female misidentified as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
