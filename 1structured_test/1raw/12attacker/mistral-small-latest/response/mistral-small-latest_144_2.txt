{probability: 0.68,

Explanation:
First, let's find the prior probability of the attacker being male given the population distribution: P(attacker is male) = 0.15.

Next, we'll use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability after considering the witness's statement. Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know P(A) = 0.15 and need to find P(W|A), P(W), and then P(A|W).

P(W|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender when the attacker is male: 0.8 (80% accuracy).

P(W) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male, considering both male and female attackers. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
P(W|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male: 0.2 (20% error rate)

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

Finally, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.68}
