{probability: 0.91, Given that 85% of the population is female, there is a 0.15 probability that the attacker is male. However, the witness identified the attacker as male with an 80% accuracy. So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. But we also need to consider the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male. This is 0.85 (probability of a female attacker) * 0.2 (probability of witness error) = 0.17. So, the total probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.91.}
