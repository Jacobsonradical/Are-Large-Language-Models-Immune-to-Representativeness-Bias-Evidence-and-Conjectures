{probability: 0.88, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification. Let's denote P(M) as the probability the attacker is male, P(F) as the probability the attacker is female, P(W|M) as the probability the witness correctly identifies a male attacker, and P(W|F) as the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male. From the given information: P(M) = 0.15, P(F) = 0.85, P(W|M) = 0.8, P(W|F) = 0.2. Using Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)] = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.88}
