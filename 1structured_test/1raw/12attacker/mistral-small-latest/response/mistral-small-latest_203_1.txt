{probability: 0.855,

The probability that the attacker is male can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let M be the event that the attacker is male and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We are given:
P(M) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]
where P(not M) = 1 - P(M) = 0.85

Plugging in the numbers, we get:
P(M|W) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.855
