{probability: 0.853, Given that 85% of the population is female, we first need to adjust the witness's accuracy rate to account for this imbalance. The witness correctly identifies males with an accuracy of 80%, but since males are a minority in the population, a random guess would have a 15% chance of being correct. Therefore, the witness's accuracy in identifying males under these circumstances is actually (0.8 - 0.15) / (1 - 0.15) = 0.857. Given that the witness identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male is 0.857.}
