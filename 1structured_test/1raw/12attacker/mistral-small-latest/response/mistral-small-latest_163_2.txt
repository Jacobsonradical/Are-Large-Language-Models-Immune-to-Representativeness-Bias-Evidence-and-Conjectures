{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender, and 85% of the population in the city is female, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Let P(M) be the probability that the attacker is male, P(W|M) be the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as male given that he is male, P(W|F) be the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as male given that he is female, and P(F) be the probability that the attacker is female. Then, P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]. Plugging in the values, we get P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.72.}
