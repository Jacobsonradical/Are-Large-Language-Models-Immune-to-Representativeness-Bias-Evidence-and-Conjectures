{probability: 0.64, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is male, given the city's population distribution, is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8. The likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is 0.2 * 0.85 (probability of attacker being female and witness making an error). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is male is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.64.}
