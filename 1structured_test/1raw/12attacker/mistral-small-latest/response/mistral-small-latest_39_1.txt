{probability: 0.68}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male. According to the information provided, the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time. So, this probability is 0.8.
2. Next, we need to account for the fact that there are more females than males in the population. Given that 85% of the population is female, only 15% is male.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. This is equal to (probability of witness being correct given attacker is male * probability of attacker being male) / (probability of witness identifying the attacker as male).
4. The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male can be calculated as follows: (probability of witness being correct given attacker is male * probability of attacker being male) + (probability of witness making a mistake given attacker is female * probability of attacker being female). Plugging in the numbers, we get: (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
5. Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony: (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.68.
