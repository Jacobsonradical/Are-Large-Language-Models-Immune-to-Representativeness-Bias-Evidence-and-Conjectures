{probability: 0.68, rounded to two decimal places}

Explanation:
This is a Bayesian probability problem. Let's use P(M) to represent the probability that the attacker is male, and P(F) to represent the probability that the attacker is female.

1. According to information b, P(M) = 0.15 and P(F) = 0.85.
2. The witness correctly identifies a male with a probability of 0.8 (80%). This is represented as P(Witness says male | Attacker is male), or P(W|M).
3. The witness incorrectly identifies a female as male with a probability of 0.1 (10%). This is represented as P(Witness says male | Attacker is female), or P(W|F).
4. We want to find P(M|W), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
5. Using Bayes' theorem: P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]
6. Plugging in the values: P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.68

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.68.
