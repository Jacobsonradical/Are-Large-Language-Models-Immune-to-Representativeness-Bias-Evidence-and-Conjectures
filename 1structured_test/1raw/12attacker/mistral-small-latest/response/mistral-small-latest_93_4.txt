{probability: 0.76, explanation: Given that 85% of the population in the city is female, we initially assume a 0.15 probability that the attacker is male. However, we have additional information from a witness who correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. Thus, the probability that the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as male is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. Since the witness is wrong in 20% of cases, the probability that the witness misidentified a female attacker as male is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together, we get a final estimate of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.76 for the probability that the attacker is male.}
