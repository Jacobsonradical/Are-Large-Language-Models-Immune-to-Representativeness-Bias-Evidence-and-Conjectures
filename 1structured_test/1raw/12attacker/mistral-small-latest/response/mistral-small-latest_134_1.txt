{probability: 0.66, explanation: Given that the attacker was identified as male by the witness, and the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, there's an 80% chance that the attacker is male. However, considering the population distribution in the city (85% female, 15% male), we need to adjust our estimate. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male can be calculated as follows: (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.66}
