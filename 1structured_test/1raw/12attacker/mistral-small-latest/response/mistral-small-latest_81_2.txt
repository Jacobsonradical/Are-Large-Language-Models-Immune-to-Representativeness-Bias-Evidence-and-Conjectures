{probability: 0.64,

Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. Given that the attacker is either male or female with equal probability (since we have no other information), we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

By Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

From the information given, P(M) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female), P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time), and P(W) = P(W|M)P(M) + P(W|not M)P(not M) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.23

So, P(M|W) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.64 or 64%.}
