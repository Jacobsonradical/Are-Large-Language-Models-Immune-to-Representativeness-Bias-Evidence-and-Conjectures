{probability: 0.72, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male, given the population distribution, is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually male, is 0.8. The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male, given that the attacker is actually female, is 0.2. Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is male is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.72.}
