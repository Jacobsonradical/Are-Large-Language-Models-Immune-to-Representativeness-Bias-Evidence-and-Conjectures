{probability: 0.856, This is calculated by multiplying the percentage of males in the city (0.15) by the witness's accuracy in identifying males (0.8), which gives us 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as a male (0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1). So, 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.856 or 85.6%.}
