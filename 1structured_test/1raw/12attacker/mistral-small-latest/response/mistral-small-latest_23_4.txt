{probability: 0.76,

This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is male, and B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male).

We also know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

To find P(B), we need to consider both the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

So, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.76}
