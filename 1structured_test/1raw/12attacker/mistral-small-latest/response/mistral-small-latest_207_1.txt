{probability: 0.68, explanation: Given the prior probability of a male attacker is 0.15 (15% of the population), we can use Bayes' theorem to update this probability based on the witness's observation. The likelihood that the witness correctly identified a male attacker is 0.8 (80% accuracy). So, the posterior probability of the attacker being male is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.68.}
