{probability: 0.68, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, we start with a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is male. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so the probability that the male witness correctly identified a male attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The probability that a female attacker was incorrectly identified as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these probabilities together gives an estimated probability that the attacker is male: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.68.}
