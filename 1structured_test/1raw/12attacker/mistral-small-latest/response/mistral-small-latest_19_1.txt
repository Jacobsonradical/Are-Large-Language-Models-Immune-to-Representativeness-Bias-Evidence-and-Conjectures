{probability: 0.48, This estimate is calculated by first considering the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification, which is 80% or 0.8. Then, taking into account the population distribution, the probability that a randomly selected person is male is 15%. Therefore, applying Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.48.}
