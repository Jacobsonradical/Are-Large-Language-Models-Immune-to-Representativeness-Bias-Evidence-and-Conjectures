{probability: 0.912, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement can be calculated as follows. Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We know P(A) = 0.15 (from information a). We need to find P(A|W). According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W). We are given P(W|A) = 0.8 (from information b). To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A). Since P(not A) = 0.85, we need P(W|not A). This is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 ≈ 0.2085. Finally, P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.2085 ≈ 0.912.}
