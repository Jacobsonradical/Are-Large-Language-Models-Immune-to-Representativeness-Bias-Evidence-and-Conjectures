{probability: 0.9,

Explanation:

Let's break this down using Bayes' theorem.

1. First, we have prior probabilities based on the city's population: P(Male) = 0.15 and P(Female) = 0.85.
2. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. So, if the attacker is male, the probability of the witness correctly identifying him as male is 0.8. This can be represented as P(Witness says Male | Attacker is Male) = 0.8.
3. Similarly, if the attacker is female, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying her as male is 0.1 (since the witness incorrectly identifies gender in 20% of cases). So, P(Witness says Male | Attacker is Female) = 0.1.
4. Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male: P(Attacker is Male | Witness says Male) = [P(Witness says Male | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male)] / [P(Witness says Male | Attacker is Male) * P(Attacker is Male) + P(Witness says Male | Attacker is Female) * P(Attacker is Female)]
5. Plugging in the values, we get: P(Attacker is Male | Witness says Male) â‰ˆ 0.9

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.9.}
