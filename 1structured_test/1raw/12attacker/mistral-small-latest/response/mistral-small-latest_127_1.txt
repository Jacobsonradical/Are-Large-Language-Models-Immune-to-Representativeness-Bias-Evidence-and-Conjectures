{probability: 0.72, This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability (0.15, since 15% of the population is male) with the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male (0.8), and then dividing by the sum of all possible outcomes. The sum of all possible outcomes is calculated as the prior probability of a male multiplied by the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male, plus the prior probability of a female multiplied by the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a female (0.2). So, (0.15*0.8) / ((0.15*0.8) + (0.85*0.2)) = 0.72.}
