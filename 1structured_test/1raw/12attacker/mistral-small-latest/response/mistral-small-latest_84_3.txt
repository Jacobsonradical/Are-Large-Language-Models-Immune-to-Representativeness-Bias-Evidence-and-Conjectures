{probability: 0.864,

Explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, there is an initial 15% chance that the attacker is male. However, due to the witness's identification and error rates, we need to adjust this probability.

Assuming the witness's ability to judge gender is consistent across the whole population, the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. This is the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identified him.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the attacker is actually female but the witness mistakenly identified him as male. This is 0.2 (the witness's error rate) times 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is female).

So, the total probability that the attacker is male, considering both the witness's correct identification and possible error, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.864 or 86.4%.
