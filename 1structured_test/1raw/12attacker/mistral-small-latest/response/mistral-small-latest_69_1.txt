{probability: 0.864, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, the base rate for a random person being male is 0.15. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. On the other hand, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives the estimated probability that the attacker is male: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.864.}
