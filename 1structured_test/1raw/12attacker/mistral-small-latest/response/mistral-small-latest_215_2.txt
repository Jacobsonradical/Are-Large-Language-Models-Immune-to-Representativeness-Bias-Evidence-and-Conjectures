{probability: 0.89, explanation: First, we calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the distribution of the population. This is 15%. Then, we consider the witness's testimony. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is male if the witness identifies him as such. Combining these probabilities using Bayes' theorem gives us an estimated probability of 0.89 that the attacker is male.}
