The probability that the attacker is male can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

We know from the problem that P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male).

From the witness's accuracy, P(W|M) = 0.8 (80% of the time the witness correctly identifies a male).

P(W) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M).

Since there are only two genders, P(not M) = 0.85.

The witness will incorrectly identify a female as male 20% of the time, so P(W|not M) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35.

Finally, P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.35 = 0.84.

So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.84.}
