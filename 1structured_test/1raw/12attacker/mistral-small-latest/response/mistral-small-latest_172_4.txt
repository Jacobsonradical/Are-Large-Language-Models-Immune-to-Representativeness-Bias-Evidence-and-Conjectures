{probability: 0.92, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the prior probability of a male attacker (0.15), the witness's accuracy in identifying gender (0.8), and the witness's identification of the attacker as male, the posterior probability of the attacker being male is approximately 0.92.}
