Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male.

Let's denote:
M = the event that the attacker is male
W = the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We know:
P(M) = 0.15 (from b)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (from a)
P(W|not M) = 0.2 (from a)
P(not M) = 1 - P(M) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

Plugging in the values:

P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.507

So, your estimate {probability: 0.507}
