{probability: 0.915, explanation: Given that 85% of the population in the city is female, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. However, the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time. So, the likelihood that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is 0.8. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability: P(attacker is male | witness said male) = [P(witness said male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male)] / P(witness said male). Since the witness identified the attacker as male, P(witness said male) = P(witness said male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness said male | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female). Assuming the witness has the same accuracy regardless of the attacker's gender, P(witness said male | attacker is female) = 0.2. Therefore, P(witness said male) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get: P(attacker is male | witness said male) â‰ˆ 0.915.}
