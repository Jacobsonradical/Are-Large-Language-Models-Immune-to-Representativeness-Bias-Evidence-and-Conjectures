{probability: 0.89, explanation: Given the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15%), and the witness's accuracy in identifying gender is 80%, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that the attacker is male. The calculation is as follows: (0.15 * 0.8) / [(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)] = 0.89.}
