{probability: 0.64, explanation: First, we calculate the probability of the attacker being male given the city's population distribution: 0.15. Then, we consider the witness's accuracy. Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, if the attacker is male, there's an 80% chance the witness will identify the attacker as male. So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. This is the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies the attacker as male. However, the witness could also misidentify a female as male. Given that the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, and the population is 85% female, the probability of this happening is: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. So the total probability of the attacker being male is: 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (misidentification) = 0.29. But since the witness identified the attacker as male, we need to consider this new information. The probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male is known as the conditional probability and can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(Male|Witness says Male) = P(Witness says Male|Male) * P(Male) / P(Witness says Male). We know P(Male) = 0.15, P(Witness says Male|Male) = 0.8, and P(Witness says Male) = P(Witness says Male|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness says Male|Female) * P(Female) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.25. Therefore, P(Male|Witness says Male) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.25 = 0.64.}
