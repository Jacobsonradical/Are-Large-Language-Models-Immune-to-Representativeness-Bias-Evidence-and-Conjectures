{probability: 0.855,

Explanation: This is a Bayes' theorem problem. Let's break it down:

1. Let M be the event that the attacker is male.
2. Let W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.
3. We know that P(M) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female, so 15% is male).
4. We also know that P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time).
5. We need to find P(M|W), which is the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
6. Bayes' theorem states that P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)
7. To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)
8. Since P(not M) = 0.85, and assuming the witness has the same error rate for males and females, P(W|not M) = 0.2
9. Plugging in the values, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22
10. Finally, P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 = 0.855

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.855.
