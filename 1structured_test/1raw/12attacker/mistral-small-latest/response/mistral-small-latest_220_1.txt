{probability: 0.84, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, there is an initial probability of 0.15 that the attacker is male. However, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so the probability that the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. Since the total probability consists of the witness being correct and the witness being incorrect, we add the probability of the witness being incorrect (0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03) to get the overall probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.84.}
