{probability: 0.91, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15%). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male if he is indeed male is 0.8 (80%). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male if he is actually female is 0.1 (20%). So, the posterior probability (probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification) is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.1)) = approximately 0.91.}
