{probability: 0.68, based on Bayes' theorem calculation}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find P(Attacker is male | Witness says male).
2. Let's denote P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) as TP (true positive rate), which is 80% or 0.8.
3. P(Witness says male | Attacker is female) is FP (false positive rate), which is the error rate of the witness, i.e., 20% or 0.2.
4. From the information given, the prior probability of the attacker being male is P(Attacker is male) = 0.15, and P(Attacker is female) = 0.85.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability P(Attacker is male | Witness says male) = [P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male)] / [P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness says male | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female)]
6. Plugging in the values, we get P(Attacker is male | Witness says male) â‰ˆ 0.68 or 68%.
