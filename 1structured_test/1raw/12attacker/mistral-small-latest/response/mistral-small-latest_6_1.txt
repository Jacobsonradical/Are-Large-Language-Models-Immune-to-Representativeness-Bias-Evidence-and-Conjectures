{probability: 0.76, The probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is female, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time, so the likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8. Applying Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of the attacker being male is approximately 0.76.}
