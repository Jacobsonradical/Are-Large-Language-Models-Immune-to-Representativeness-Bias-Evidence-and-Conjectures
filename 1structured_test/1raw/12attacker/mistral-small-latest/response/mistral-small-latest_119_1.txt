{probability: 0.7875}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability that the attacker is male given the population distribution. Since 85% of the population is female, this means that 15% of the population is male. So the initial probability that the attacker is male is 0.15.
2. Next, we consider the witness's testimony. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time under similar conditions, so there's an 80% chance that the witness is correct when identifying the attacker as male.
3. To calculate the final probability, we multiply the initial probability of the attacker being male (0.15) by the probability that the witness is correct when identifying the attacker as male (0.8): 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
4. However, there's also a possibility that the witness made an error and the attacker is actually female. Since the witness makes errors in 20% of the cases, and the population is 85% female, there's a 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 chance that the attacker is female, but the witness mistakenly identified them as male.
5. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is male, considering both the population distribution and the witness's testimony, is the sum of the probabilities calculated above: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.7875.
