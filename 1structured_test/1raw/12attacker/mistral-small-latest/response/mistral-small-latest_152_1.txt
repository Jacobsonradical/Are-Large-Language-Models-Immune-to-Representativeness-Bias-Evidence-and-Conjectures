{probability: 0.78, explanation: Given the witness's accuracy of 80% in identifying gender and the base rate of the population being 85% female, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male. Let's denote M as the event that the attacker is male, and W as the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(M|W). Using Bayes' theorem: P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W). We know that P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying males), P(M) = 0.15 (the base rate of the population), and P(W) = P(W|M)*P(M) + P(W|not M)*P(not M) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.26. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.78. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.78.}
