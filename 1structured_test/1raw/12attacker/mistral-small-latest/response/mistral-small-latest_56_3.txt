{probability: 0.64, This is calculated by multiplying the base rate of males in the city (0.15) by the accuracy of the witness in identifying males (0.8), which gives us 0.12. Then we multiply the base rate of females in the city (0.85) by the witness's error rate in identifying females as males (0.2), which gives us 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us the estimated probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. However, since the question asks for the probability that the attacker is male, we need to divide this by the total probability (since the attacker could also be a female), which is 0.29 / (0.29 + 0.85*0.2) = 0.64.}
