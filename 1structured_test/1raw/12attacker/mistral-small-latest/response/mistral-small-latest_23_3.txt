{probability: 0.68, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the base rate for a male attacker is 0.15. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so the probability of them correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, there is also a chance that they incorrectly identified a female as male. Since they make errors in 20% of cases, the probability of them misidentifying a female attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 (correctly identified) + 0.17 (incorrectly identified) = 0.68 or 68%.}
