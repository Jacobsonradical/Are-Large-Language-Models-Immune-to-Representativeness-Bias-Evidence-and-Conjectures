{probability: 0.88, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and half of the sample is male). The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male). So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.88.}
