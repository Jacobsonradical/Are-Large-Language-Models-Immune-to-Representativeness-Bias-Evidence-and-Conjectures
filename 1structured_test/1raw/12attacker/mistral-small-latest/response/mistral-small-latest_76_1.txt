{probability: 0.725, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification can be calculated as follows: P(attacker is male | witness identifies as male) = [P(witness identifies as male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male)] / P(witness identifies as male). We have P(witness identifies as male | attacker is male) = 0.8 (from the information in "a"), P(attacker is male) = 0.15 (from the information in "b"), and P(witness identifies as male) = P(witness identifies as male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness identifies as male | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26. So, P(attacker is male | witness identifies as male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.725.}
