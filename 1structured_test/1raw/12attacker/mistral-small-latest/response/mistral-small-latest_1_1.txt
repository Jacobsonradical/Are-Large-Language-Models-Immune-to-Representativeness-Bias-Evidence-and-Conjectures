{probability: 0.68, Given the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the demographic distribution of the city, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Calculations: Let's denote the event of the attacker being male as M and the event of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender as W. We want to find P(M|W), the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. According to Bayes' theorem: P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W). We know that P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying males), P(M) = 0.15 (the percentage of males in the city), and P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 ≈ 0.27. Therefore, P(M|W) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.27 ≈ 0.68.}
