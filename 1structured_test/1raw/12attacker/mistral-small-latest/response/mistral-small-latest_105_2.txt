{probability: 0.89, Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male given that the attacker is male is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.1 (20% error rate) * 0.85 (85% of the population is female) = 0.17. So, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.17) = 0.89.
