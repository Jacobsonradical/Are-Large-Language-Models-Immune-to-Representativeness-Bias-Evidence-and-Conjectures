{probability: 0.76, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.76 or 76%}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Bayes' theorem can be used to solve this problem.
2. Let's denote M as the event that the attacker is male, and W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.
3. We need to find P(M|W), the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.
4. Using Bayes' theorem: P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)
5. P(M) = 0.15 (from the information provided in "a")
6. P(W|M) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies the gender as male)
7. To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|M)P(M) + P(W|not M)P(not M)
8. P(not M) = 0.85 (complement of P(M))
9. P(W|not M) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the gender as male)
10. Calculate P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) ≈ 0.21
11. Finally, calculate P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.21 ≈ 0.76
