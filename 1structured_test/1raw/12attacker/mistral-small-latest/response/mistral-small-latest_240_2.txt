{probability: 0.784,

Explanation: We use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W), where:

P(M) = 0.15 (given information "a")
P(W|M) = 0.8 (given information "b")
P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

So, P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.784}
