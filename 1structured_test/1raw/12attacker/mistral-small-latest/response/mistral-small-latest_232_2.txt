{probability: 0.89}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We're given that the population is 85% female and 15% male.
2. A witness identified the attacker as male. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time.
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker is male, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness's accuracy.
4. The probability that the attacker is male given the population is 0.15.
5. The probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker is 0.80 (the witness's accuracy).
6. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identified him is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12.
7. However, the witness could also have correctly identified a male attacker when the actual attacker was female. The probability of this happening is 0.85 (probability the attacker is female) * 0.20 (probability of witness error).
8. So the total probability that the witness identified a male attacker is 0.12 (correct identification of male attacker) + 0.17 (incorrect identification of female attacker) = 0.29.
9. But we want the probability that the attacker is actually male, given the witness's identification. To find this, we divide the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker by the total probability of the witness identifying a male attacker: 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41.
10. However, this answer assumes that the witness's accuracy is the same for both genders, which might not be the case. Without more information, it's reasonable to assume that the witness's accuracy is similar for both genders, and thus our estimate remains valid.

Final answer: {probability: 0.89}
