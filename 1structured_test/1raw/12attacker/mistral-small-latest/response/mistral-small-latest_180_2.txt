{probability: 0.68, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is female is 0.2 (20% error rate). Therefore, the posterior probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is approximately 0.68.}
