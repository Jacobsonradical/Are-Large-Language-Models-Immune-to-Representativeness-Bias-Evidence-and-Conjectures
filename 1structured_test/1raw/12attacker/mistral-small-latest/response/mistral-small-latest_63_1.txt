{probability: 0.864, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification. Let M represent the event that the attacker is male, and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(M|W).

First, we need P(M), which is given as 0.15 (15% of the population).

Next, P(W|M) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, which is 0.8 (80% accuracy).

P(W|not M) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male. Since there are 85% females and the witness makes an error in 20% of cases, P(W|not M) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Finally, P(W) is the overall probability that the witness identifies any person as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|M)P(M) + P(W|not M)P(not M) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.17*0.85 ≈ 0.206.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem: P(M|W) = P(W|M)P(M)/P(W) ≈ 0.8*0.15/0.206 ≈ 0.864.}
