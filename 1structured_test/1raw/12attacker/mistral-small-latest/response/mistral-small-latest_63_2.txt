{probability: 0.88, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker given that the attacker is male is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker given that the attacker is female is 0.2 (20% error rate). So, the posterior probability (or the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male) is approximately 0.88.}
