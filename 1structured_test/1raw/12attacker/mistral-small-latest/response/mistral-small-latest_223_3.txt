{probability: 0.68, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, there is initially a 15% chance that the attacker is male. However, the witness identified the attacker as male. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate, so the probability that the witness is correct in this instance is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. Adding this to the initial probability gives us a total probability of 0.15 + 0.12 = 0.68.}
