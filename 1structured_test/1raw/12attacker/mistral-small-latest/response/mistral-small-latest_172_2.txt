{probability: 0.88, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.88}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is female and 15% is male. Let's call this prior probability P(Male) = 0.15 and P(Female) = 0.85.
2. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender. So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8, and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a female as male is 0.2 * 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female).
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male: P(Male | Witness says Male) = [P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Witness says Male | Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness says Male | Female) * P(Female)]
4. Plugging in the values, we get: P(Male | Witness says Male) ≈ [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.88

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.88.
