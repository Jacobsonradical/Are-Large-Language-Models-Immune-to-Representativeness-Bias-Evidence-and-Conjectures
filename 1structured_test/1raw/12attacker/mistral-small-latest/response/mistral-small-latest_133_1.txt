{probability: 0.64, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony. The prior probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 (15% of the population). The probability of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8 (80% accuracy), and the probability of the witness identifying a female as male is 0.1 (20% error rate). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.1)) â‰ˆ 0.64.}
