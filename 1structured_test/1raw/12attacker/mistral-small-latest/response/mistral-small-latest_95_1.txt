{probability: 0.84, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, the prior probability that the attacker is male is 0.15. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time. So, the probability that the witness correctly identified the gender of the attacker, given that the attacker is male, is 0.8. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification. This is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.84 or 84%.}
