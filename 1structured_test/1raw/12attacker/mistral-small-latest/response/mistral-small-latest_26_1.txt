{probability: 0.88, This is based on Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is female, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. The witness identified the attacker as male, and given their accuracy rate of 80% in identifying the gender of a person under similar conditions, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.88.}
