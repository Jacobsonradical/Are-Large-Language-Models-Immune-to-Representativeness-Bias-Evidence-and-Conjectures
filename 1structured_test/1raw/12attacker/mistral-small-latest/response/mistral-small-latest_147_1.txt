{probability: 0.58, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the prior probability of an attacker being male (0.15), the likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is male (0.8), and the total probability of the witness's observation (0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.203). Therefore, the posterior probability of the attacker being male is 0.58.}
