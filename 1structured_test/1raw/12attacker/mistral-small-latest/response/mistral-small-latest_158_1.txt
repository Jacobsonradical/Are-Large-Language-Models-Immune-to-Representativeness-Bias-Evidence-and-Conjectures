{probability: 0.889, explanation: This is a Bayes' theorem problem. The prior probability that the attacker is male, given the population distribution, is 0.15. The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male, is 0.8 (80% accuracy). So, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.889}
