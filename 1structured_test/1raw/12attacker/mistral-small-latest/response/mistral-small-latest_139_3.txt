Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified him as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male)

The witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8

To find P(B), we need to consider both the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male.

Since 85% of the population is female, P(not A) = 0.85. Given that the witness makes errors 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.545

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.545.
