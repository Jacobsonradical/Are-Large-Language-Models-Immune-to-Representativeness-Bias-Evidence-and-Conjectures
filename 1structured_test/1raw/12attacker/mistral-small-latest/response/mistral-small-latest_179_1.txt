Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
- M as the event that the attacker is male
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We know that:
- P(M) = 0.15 (from information b)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (from information a, the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time)
- P(W|not M) = 0.2 (from information a, the witness incorrectly identifies gender 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M))

where P(not M) = 1 - P(M) = 0.85

Calculating this, we get P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.46.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.46}
