Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male.

Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the information provided:
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time when the person is male)

To find P(W), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is male and female.

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
P(not A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is female)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (since the witness makes an error 20% of the time when the person is female)

Plugging in the values:
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

Now we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.545

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.545.
