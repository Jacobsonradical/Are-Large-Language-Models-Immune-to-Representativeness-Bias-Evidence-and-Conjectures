{probability: 0.78, Given that 85% of the population is female, there's a base probability of 0.15 that the attacker is male. However, the witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time, so the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. But we also need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error when identifying a female attacker as male. Since 15% of the population is male, the base probability of the attacker being female is 0.85. If the witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male, the probability is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability that the attacker is male: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.78.}
