{probability: 0.68, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 due to the demographics of the city. The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8, and the total probability of the witness's observation is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a male (0.15*0.8) and incorrectly identifying a female (0.85*0.2). The posterior probability is (0.15*0.8) / (0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2) = 0.68.}
