{probability: 0.87, explanation: Given the population distribution in the city, the prior probability that the attacker is male is 0.15. Given the witness's accuracy rate, if the attacker is male, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender is 0.8. So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. However, we need to normalize this value given the witness's identification (which increases our certainty). The probability that the witness correctly identifies the gender, regardless of the actual gender, is 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.5. So, the normalized probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 / 0.5 = 0.87.}
