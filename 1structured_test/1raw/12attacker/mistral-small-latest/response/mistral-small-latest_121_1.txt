{probability: 0.52, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, the probability that the attacker is indeed male can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population), and the likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8 (80% accuracy). Therefore, the posterior probability, or the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.52.}
