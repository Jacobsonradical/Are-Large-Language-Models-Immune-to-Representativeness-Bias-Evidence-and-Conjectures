{probability: 0.65, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The probability of the witness making that identification given the attacker is male is therefore 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The probability of the witness identifying a female as male is 0.5 (50% of the population) * 0.2 (20% error rate) = 0.1. The total probability of the witness identifying a person as male is 0.12 (male attacker) + 0.1 (female attacker) = 0.22. Therefore, the posterior probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 / 0.22 = 0.65 or 65%.}
