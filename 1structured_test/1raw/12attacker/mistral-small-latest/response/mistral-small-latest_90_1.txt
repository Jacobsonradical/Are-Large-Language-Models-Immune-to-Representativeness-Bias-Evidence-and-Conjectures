Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem, we know that:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time when the person is male)
P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female)
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A)
where P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the gender 20% of the time when the person is female)
and P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

So, P(B) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.21

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.21 = 0.5714 (approx.)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.57.

Answer: {probability: 0.57}
