{probability: 0.792, explanation: We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. The prior probability (based on the population) is 0.15 (15% male). The likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The probability of the witness identifying a female as male is 0.1 (20% error rate * 0.5 probability of the attacker being female). Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability (probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement) is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.1) = 0.792.}
