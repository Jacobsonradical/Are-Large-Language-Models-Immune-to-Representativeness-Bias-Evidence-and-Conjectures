{probability: 0.68, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, a random person would have a 0.15 probability of being male. However, the witness identified the attacker as male. Considering the witness's accuracy rate of 80%, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified them as such, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The probability ends up being approximately 0.68, or 68%.}
