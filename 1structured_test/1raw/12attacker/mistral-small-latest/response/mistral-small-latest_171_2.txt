{probability: 0.875, explanation: Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as male, we can multiply the base rate of males in the city (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate (0.8) to get an estimated probability that the attacker is male. This gives us 0.15*0.8 = 0.12. However, this calculation doesn't account for the fact that the witness could also misidentify a female as male. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.85*0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together, we get 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. This is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as male, whether they were actually male or not. To get the probability that the attacker is actually male, given that the witness identified them as such, we need to divide the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male (0.12) by the total probability of the witness identifying someone as male (0.29). This gives us a probability of 0.12/0.29 â‰ˆ 0.875, or 87.5%.}
