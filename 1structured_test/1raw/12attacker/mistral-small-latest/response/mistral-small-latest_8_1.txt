{probability: 0.83, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15, given the population distribution. The likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8, given their accuracy rate. So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.83}
