{probability: 0.66,

Explanation: We can use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

From the information given, we have:
P(M) = 0.15 (the proportion of males in the city)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male)
P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male)
P(not M) = 1 - P(M) = 0.85

By Bayes' theorem, P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(M|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.66}
