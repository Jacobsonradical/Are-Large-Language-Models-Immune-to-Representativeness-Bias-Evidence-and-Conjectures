{probability: 0.78, The probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.78 or 78%.}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The prior probability of the attacker being male based on the city's population is 0.15.
2. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker when they are indeed male is 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time).
3. So, the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker given that the attacker is male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
4. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male. The probability of this happening is 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being female) * 0.2 (probability of the witness making an error) = 0.17.
5. Therefore, the total probability of the attacker being male, considering both the correct identification of a male attacker and the incorrect identification of a female attacker, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.78 or 78%.
