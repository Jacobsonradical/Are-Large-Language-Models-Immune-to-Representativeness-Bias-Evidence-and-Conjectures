{probability: 0.5556, given the witness's accuracy and the gender distribution in the city, the probability that the attacker is male can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8 (80% accuracy). So, the posterior probability (the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement) is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.5556.}
