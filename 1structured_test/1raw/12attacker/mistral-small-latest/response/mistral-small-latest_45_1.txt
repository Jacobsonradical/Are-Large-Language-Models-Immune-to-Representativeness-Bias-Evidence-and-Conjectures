{probability: 0.625, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's statement can be calculated as follows. Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(M|W).

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

From the given information, P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the gender 80% of the time), P(M) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female), and P(W) needs to be calculated using total probability:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.625.}
