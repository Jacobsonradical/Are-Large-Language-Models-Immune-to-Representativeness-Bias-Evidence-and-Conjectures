{probability: 0.68, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. The witness identified the attacker as male with an accuracy of 80%. So, the probability that the attacker is indeed male given the witness's identification is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error. The probability that the attacker is female but the witness identified as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability that the attacker is male: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.68.}
