{probability: 0.895, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, we can start with a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is male. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so if the attacker is male, there is an 80% chance that the witness will identify the attacker correctly. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male and the witness correctly identifies the attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The witness could also have incorrectly identified a female attacker as male, which happens 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. In total, the probability that the attacker is male is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. However, since we only have the information that the witness identified the attacker as male, we need to normalize this probability by considering the total probability of the witness making that identification. This includes the correct identification of a male attacker (0.12) and the incorrect identification of a female attacker (0.17). So, the final estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 / (0.29 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.895.}
