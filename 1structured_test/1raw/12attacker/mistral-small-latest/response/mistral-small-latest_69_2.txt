{probability: 0.890, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement can be calculated as follows: P(male|witness says male) = P(witness says male|male)*P(male) / [P(witness says male|male)*P(male) + P(witness says male|female)*P(female)]. Here, P(male) = 0.15, P(witness says male|male) = 0.8, P(witness says male|female) = 0.2 (since the witness makes an error 20% of the time). P(female) can be calculated as 1 - P(male) = 0.85. Substituting these values into the formula gives an estimate of 0.890.}
