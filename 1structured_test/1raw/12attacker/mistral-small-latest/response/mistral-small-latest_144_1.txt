{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, the base rate for the attacker being male is 0.15. The witness identified the attacker as male, and they have an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender under similar conditions. Applying the witness's accuracy to the base rate, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made a mistake and the attacker is actually female. The probability of the witness making a mistake is 0.2 (20% error rate), and since 85% of the population is female, the probability of the attacker being female and the witness making a mistake is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (mistaken identification) = 0.64.}
