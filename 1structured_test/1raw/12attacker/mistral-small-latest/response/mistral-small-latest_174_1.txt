{probability: 0.68, This is based on the probability of a male attacker given the witness identification and the population distribution. The witness's identification has a 0.8 probability of being correct for a male. Given that 15% of the population is male, this results in a probability of 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 for a correct identification of a male attacker. However, the witness could also incorrectly identify a female as male. Given that 85% of the population is female, and the witness has a 0.2 probability of making this mistake, this results in a probability of 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives a total probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 that the witness identified a male. However, we are asked for the probability that the attacker is actually male, not just that they were identified as male. Since the population is 15% male, and the witness correctly identified a male with a probability of 0.12, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.68 or 68%.}
