{probability: 0.71, The probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Given the prior probability (85% of the population is female, so 15% is male), and the likelihood (the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time), the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.71 or 71%. This calculation assumes that the witness's errors are random and not biased towards one gender.}
