{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, we can start by assuming the attacker is female. However, the witness identified the attacker as male. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender under similar conditions. So, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as such is 0.8. But since only 15% of the population is male, we need to adjust this probability. This can be done using Bayes' theorem: P(male|witness) = [P(witness|male) * P(male)] / P(witness). We know P(witness|male) = 0.8, P(male) = 0.15. To find P(witness), we can consider both possibilities: P(witness) = P(witness|male)*P(male) + P(witness|female)*P(female). We don't have the error rate for identifying females, but it's the complement of the success rate for males, which is 0.2. So, P(witness|female) = 0.2. Plugging these values into the equation for P(witness), we get 0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2 = 0.22. Finally, plugging everything into Bayes' theorem, we get P(male|witness) = (0.8*0.15)/0.22 = 0.64.}
