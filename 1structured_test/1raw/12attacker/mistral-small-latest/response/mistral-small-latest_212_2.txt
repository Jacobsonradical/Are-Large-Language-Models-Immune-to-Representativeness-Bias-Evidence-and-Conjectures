{probability: 0.72, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, the prior probability that the attacker is male is 0.15. The witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying gender. So, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male, given that the attacker is male, is 0.8. Applying Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.72.}
