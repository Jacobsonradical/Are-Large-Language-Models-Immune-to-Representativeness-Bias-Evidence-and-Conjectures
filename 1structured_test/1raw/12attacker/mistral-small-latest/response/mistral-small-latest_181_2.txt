{probability: 0.912}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male. Let's call this P(correct | male).
2. From the information provided, we know that the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time. So P(correct | male) = 0.8.
3. Now we need to use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. Let's call this P(male | correct).
4. Bayes' theorem states that P(male | correct) = P(correct | male) * P(male) / P(correct).
5. We know P(correct | male) = 0.8 and P(male) = 0.15 (from the population information).
6. To find P(correct), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker being male or female.
7. The probability of the attacker being female is 0.85. If the attacker is female, the witness would be incorrect, and the probability of this happening is 0.2 (from the information that the witness correctly identifies females 80% of the time).
8. So P(correct) = P(correct | male) * P(male) + P(incorrect | female) * P(female) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23.
9. Using Bayes' theorem, P(male | correct) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.912.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.912.
