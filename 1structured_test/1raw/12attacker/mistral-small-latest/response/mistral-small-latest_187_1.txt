{probability: 0.67,

Explanation: This is a conditional probability question that can be solved using Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W), where:
- P(W|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is male, which is 0.8 (from information a).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is male, which is 0.15 (from information b).
- P(W) is the probability that the witness identifies any random person as male. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A). Given that the witness is correct in 80% of cases and the population is 85% female, P(W|not A) is 0.16 (0.2 * 0.85). So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.16 * 0.85 = 0.204.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.204 = 0.67 (rounded to two decimal places).}
