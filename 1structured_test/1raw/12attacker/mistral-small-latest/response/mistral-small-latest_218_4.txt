{probability: 0.68, Given that 85% of the population is female, there is a 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 chance that the witness mistakenly identified a female as male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, there is a 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 chance that the witness correctly identified a male attacker. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.68.}
