{probability: 0.875}

Here's the reasoning:
1. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is male as P(M).
2. Given the population distribution in the city, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15.
3. Let's denote the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as P(C|M), given that the attacker is male.
4. From the witness's reliability, we know that P(C|M) = 0.8 (80% accuracy in identifying males).
5. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(M|C) as follows: P(M|C) = P(C|M) * P(M) / P(C)
6. P(C) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of the attacker's actual gender. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male and the witness being incorrect given that the attacker is female: P(C) = P(C|M) * P(M) + P(C|F) * P(F)
7. P(C|F) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female attacker as male. Since the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, they must be incorrect 20% of the time: P(C|F) = 0.2.
8. P(F) is the prior probability of the attacker being female, which is 0.85.
9. Substituting the values, we get: P(M|C) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.875.
