  "explanation": "Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement. Let M be the event of the attacker being male and W be the event of the witness identifying the attacker as male. We want to find P(M|W).

  P(M) = 0.15 (85% of the population is female, so 15% is male)
  P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)
  P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time)
  P(not M) = 0.85 (complement of P(M))

  P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]
         = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
