{probability: 0.875}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume the attacker was randomly chosen from the population. Given the information in "a", the base probability that the attacker is male is 0.15.
2. Now, consider the witness's testimony. According to "b", the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying gender.
3. To find the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(Male|Witness says male) = [P(Witness says male|Male) * P(Male)] / P(Witness says male)
4. P(Witness says male|Male) is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying males), and P(Male) is 0.15 (the base probability of the attacker being male).
5. P(Witness says male) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(Witness says male) = P(Witness says male|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness says male|Female) * P(Female)
6. P(Witness says male|Female) is the witness's error rate when identifying females, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. P(Female) is 0.85.
7. Substituting the values, we get P(Witness says male) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
8. Finally, substituting these values into Bayes' theorem: P(Male|Witness says male) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.875

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.875.
