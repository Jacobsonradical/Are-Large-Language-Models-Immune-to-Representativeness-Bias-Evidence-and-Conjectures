{probability: 0.86, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the prior probability of the attacker being male (0.15), the probability of the witness correctly identifying the gender of a male (0.8), and the probability of the witness making an error in identifying a female as male (0.1 * 0.2).}
