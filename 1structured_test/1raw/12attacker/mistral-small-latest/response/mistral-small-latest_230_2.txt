{probability: 0.5714, explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. Given the witness's accuracy and the population distribution, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is male. If we apply Bayes' theorem, we get: P(attacker is male | witness says male) = [P(witness says male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male)] / P(witness says male). We know P(witness says male | attacker is male) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy), P(attacker is male) = 0.15 (from the population distribution). To find P(witness says male), we consider both possibilities: P(witness says male) = P(witness says male | attacker is male) * P(attacker is male) + P(witness says male | attacker is female) * P(attacker is female). Since P(witness says male | attacker is female) is the error rate, which is 0.2, and P(attacker is female) = 0.85, we can calculate P(witness says male) = 0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2 = 0.23. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(attacker is male | witness says male) â‰ˆ 0.5714.}
