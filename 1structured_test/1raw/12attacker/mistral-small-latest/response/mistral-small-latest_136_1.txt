{probability: 0.68, Based on Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification can be calculated. Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, and the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.68.}
