{probability: 0.76, The probability that the attacker is male can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is female, there's an initial probability of 0.15 that the attacker is male. The witness identified the attacker as male with an 80% accuracy rate. Combining these two pieces of information, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.76.}
