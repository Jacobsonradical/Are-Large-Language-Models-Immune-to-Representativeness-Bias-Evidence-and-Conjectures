{probability: 0.792, explanation: Given the city's population distribution, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. Assuming the witness's accuracy is independent of the attacker's gender, the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male when they are indeed male is 0.8 (80%). So, P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) = 0.8. Using Bayes' theorem, P(Attacker is male | Witness says male) = [P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male)] / [P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness says male | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female)]. Since the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time, P(Witness says male | Attacker is female) = 0.2. And P(Attacker is female) = 0.85. Plugging these values into the formula, we get a probability of approximately 0.792 or 79.2%.}
