{probability: 0.876, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's statement. Let M be the event that the attacker is male. Given the population distribution, P(M) = 0.15. Let W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. Given that the attacker is male, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's gender is 0.8 (80%). Thus, P(W|M) = 0.8. Similarly, if the attacker is female, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as male is 0.2 (20%). Given that the attacker is female, the probability of W is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. So, P(W|not M) = 0.17. Now, we can calculate P(M|W) using Bayes' theorem: P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W). P(W) can be calculated as P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.209. Therefore, P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.209 â‰ˆ 0.876.}
