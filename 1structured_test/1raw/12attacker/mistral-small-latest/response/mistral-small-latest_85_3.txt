{probability: 0.91, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification can be calculated. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population). The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a female attacker as male is 0.1 (20% error rate multiplied by 0.85, the proportion of females in the city). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification, is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.1) = 0.91.}
