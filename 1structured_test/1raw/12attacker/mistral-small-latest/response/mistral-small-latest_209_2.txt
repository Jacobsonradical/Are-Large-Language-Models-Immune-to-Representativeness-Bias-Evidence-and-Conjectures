{probability: 0.873, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's testimony can be calculated as follows: P(Male|Testimony) = P(Testimony|Male) * P(Male) / P(Testimony). We know from the information that P(Testimony|Male) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(Male) = 0.15 (the population distribution), and P(Testimony) = P(Testimony|Male) * P(Male) + P(Testimony|Female) * P(Female) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(Male|Testimony) â‰ˆ 0.873.}
