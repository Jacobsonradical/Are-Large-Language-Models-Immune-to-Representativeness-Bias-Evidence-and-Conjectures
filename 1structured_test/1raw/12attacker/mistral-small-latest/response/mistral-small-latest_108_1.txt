{probability: 0.75,

Explanation: This is a classic problem of conditional probability. Let's break it down:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. This is the witness's accuracy rate, often denoted as P(correct|male or female), which means the probability of the witness being correct given that the person is either male or female.
2. However, we need to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male, or P(male|correct).
3. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this: P(male|correct) = P(correct|male) * P(male) / P(correct)
4. We know P(correct|male) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate for males), and P(male) = 0.15 (from the information about the city's population).
5. P(correct) can be calculated using the total probability theorem: P(correct) = P(correct|male)*P(male) + P(correct|female)*P(female)
6. Since the witness is equally likely to be correct for males and females, P(correct|female) = P(correct|male) = 0.8. And P(female) = 0.85.
7. Substituting these values into the equation for P(correct), we get P(correct) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.8*0.85 = 0.79
8. Finally, substituting all the calculated values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(male|correct) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.79 â‰ˆ 0.75
