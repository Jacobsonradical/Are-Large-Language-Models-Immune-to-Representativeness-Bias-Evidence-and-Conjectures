Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male.

Let A be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as male. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know from the problem:
- P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is male)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is male or the attacker is female.

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

Since 85% of the population is female:
- P(not A) = 0.85
- P(W|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, which is 0.2 (since the witness makes errors 20% of the time)

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 ≈ 0.22

Finally, P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 ≈ 0.545

The answer is: {probability: 0.545}
