{probability: 0.62, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time and the attacker is male, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's gender as male is 0.8. Given that 85% of the population is female, there is a base rate of 0.15 that the attacker is male. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony: P(male|testimony) = P(testimony|male) * P(male) / P(testimony). We know P(testimony|male) = 0.8 and P(male) = 0.15. We also need to calculate P(testimony), which is the sum of the probabilities of the witness giving the same testimony for both males and females: P(testimony) = P(testimony|male)*P(male) + P(testimony|female)*P(female). Assuming the witness makes the same number of errors for both genders (10% for males and 20% for females), P(testimony|female) = 0.2. Plugging in the values, P(testimony) = 0.12 + 0.8*0.85 = 0.71. Therefore, P(male|testimony) = 0.8*0.15/0.71 â‰ˆ 0.62.}
