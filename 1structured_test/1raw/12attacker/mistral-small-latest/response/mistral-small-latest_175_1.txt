{probability: 0.82, Given the witness's accuracy in identifying gender and the population distribution in the city, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The witness identified the attacker as male, so we need to find the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness said so. This is calculated as (probability of witness being correct given the attacker is male * probability of attacker being male) / (probability of witness saying male * total probability of attacker's gender). The probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (given in b), the probability of the witness being correct given the attacker is male is 0.8 (given in a), the probability of the witness saying male given any attacker is 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 (applying the witness's error rate to the female population), and the total probability of attacker's gender is 1. So, the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.82.}
