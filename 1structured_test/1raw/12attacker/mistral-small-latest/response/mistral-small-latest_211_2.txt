{probability: 0.727}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We start with the base rate of males in the city, which is 15%.
2. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
3. If the attacker is actually male, there's an 80% chance that the witness will correctly identify him as male. So, 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%, is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as male.
4. If the attacker is actually female, there's a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify him as male. Since 85% of the population is female, 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%, is the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male.
5. The total probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified him as such, is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, or 29%.
6. However, we need to express this as a probability between 0 and 1. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.29 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.727.
