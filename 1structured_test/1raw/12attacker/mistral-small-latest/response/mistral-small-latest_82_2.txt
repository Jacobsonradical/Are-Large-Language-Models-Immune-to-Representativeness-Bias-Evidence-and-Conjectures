{probability: 0.86}

Explanation:
Assuming the witness's accuracy in identifying gender is independent of the actual gender distribution in the city, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male using Bayes' theorem.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

P(M) = 0.15 (from the given city population distribution)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies male attackers 80% of the time)
P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies female attackers as male 20% of the time)
P(not M) = 0.85 (complementary probability to P(M))

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(M|W):

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / (P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M))
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
