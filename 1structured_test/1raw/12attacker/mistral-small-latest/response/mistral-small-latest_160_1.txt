{probability: 0.89, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem and the information provided. Given that 85% of the population is female, we start with a base rate of 0.15 for the attacker being male. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time in similar conditions, so we multiply the base rate by the witness's accuracy to get the final probability.}
