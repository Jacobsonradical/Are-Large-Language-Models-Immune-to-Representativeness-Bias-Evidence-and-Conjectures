{probability: 0.76, based on Bayes' theorem, the probability of the attacker being male is approximately 0.76 or 76%.}

Here's the reasoning:
1. Let's denote P(M) as the probability of the attacker being male, and P(F) as the probability of the attacker being female.
2. Given the city's population distribution, P(M) = 0.15 and P(F) = 0.85.
3. Let's denote P(W|M) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually male, and P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female.
4. From the witness's accuracy, P(W|M) = 0.8 and P(W|F) = 0.2.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(M|W) (the probability of the attacker being male given the witness's identification): P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]
6. Plugging in the values, we get P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.76.
