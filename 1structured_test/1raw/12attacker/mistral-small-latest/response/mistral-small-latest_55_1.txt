{probability: 0.7875, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male under the given conditions is 0.8. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker is the product of these two probabilities: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a female as male is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, whether correct or not, is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.22. Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a male attacker divided by the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male: 0.12 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.7875.}
