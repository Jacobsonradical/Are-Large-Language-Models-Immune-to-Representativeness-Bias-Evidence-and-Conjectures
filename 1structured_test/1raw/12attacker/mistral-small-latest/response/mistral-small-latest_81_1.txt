{probability: 0.62, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's testimony can be calculated as follows. Let M represent the event that the attacker is male and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(M|W).

From the information given, we have:
P(M) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker is male, assuming the population distribution)
P(W|M) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a male, given that the attacker is male)
P(W|not M) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male, given that the attacker is female)
P(not M) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is female)

Bayes' theorem states that P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(M|W) ≈ (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)] ≈ 0.62}
