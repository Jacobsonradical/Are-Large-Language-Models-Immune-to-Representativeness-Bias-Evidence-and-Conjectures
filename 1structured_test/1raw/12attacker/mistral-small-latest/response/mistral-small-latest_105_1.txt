{probability: 0.76, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, the initial probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. However, the witness identified the attacker as male with an accuracy of 80% under similar conditions. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed male given the witness's statement is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in identifying a female attacker as male. This happens with a probability of 0.15 (initial probability of the attacker being female) * 0.2 (probability of the witness making an error) = 0.03. Adding both probabilities, we get 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 or 0.76 when expressed as a proportion.}
