{probability: 0.784, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification and the population ratio. P(male|identified as male) = P(identified as male|male) * P(male) / P(identified as male). From the information given, P(identified as male|male) = 0.8, P(male) = 0.15, and P(identified as male) = P(identified as male|male) * P(male) + P(identified as male|female) * P(female) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29. Substituting these values into the equation, we get P(male|identified as male) â‰ˆ 0.784.}
