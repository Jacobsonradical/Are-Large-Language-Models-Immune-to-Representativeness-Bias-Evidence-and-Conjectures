{probability: 0.875, explanation: Given that 85% of the population in the city is female, we start with a base rate of 0.15 for the attacker being male. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, so if the attacker is male, there is an 80% chance the witness will correctly identify the gender. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified him as male is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility of the witness making an error when identifying a female attacker. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of a random person being female is 0.85. If the attacker is female, the witness has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying her as male. So, the probability of the witness identifying a female attacker as male is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. In total, the probability that the attacker is male is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.875.}
