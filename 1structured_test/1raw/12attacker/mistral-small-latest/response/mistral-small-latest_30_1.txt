{probability: 0.709, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness said the attacker is male is calculated as follows: P(male|witness says male) = [P(witness says male|male) * P(male)] / [P(witness says male|male) * P(male) + P(witness says male|female) * P(female)] = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.709}
