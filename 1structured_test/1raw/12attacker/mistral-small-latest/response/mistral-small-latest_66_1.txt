{probability: 0.58, Given the witness's 80% accuracy in identifying gender and the city's population distribution of 85% female and 15% male, the probability that the attacker is male can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The calculation is as follows: P(Male|Witness says male) = [P(Witness says male|Male) * P(Male)] / [P(Witness says male|Male) * P(Male) + P(Witness says male|Female) * P(Female)] = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.58 or 58%.}
