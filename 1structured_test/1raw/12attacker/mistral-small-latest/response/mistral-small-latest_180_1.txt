{probability: 0.46, explanation: Given the witness's accuracy rate and the population distribution, the probability that the attacker is male can be calculated as follows:

First, calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's gender given that the attacker is male. This is 0.80 (the witness's accuracy rate).

Next, calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's gender given that the attacker is female. This is 0.20 (the witness's error rate).

Then, use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male:

P(Attacker is male | Witness says male) = [P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male)] / [P(Witness says male | Attacker is male) * P(Attacker is male) + P(Witness says male | Attacker is female) * P(Attacker is female)]

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

P(Attacker is male | Witness says male) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85] = 0.46}
