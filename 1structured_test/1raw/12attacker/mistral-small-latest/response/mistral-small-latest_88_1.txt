{probability: 0.92, explanation: Given the witness's accuracy of 80%, and the fact that the attacker was identified as male, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being male is 0.8. However, we also need to consider the gender distribution in the city. Since 85% of the population is female, there's an initial probability of 0.15 that the attacker is male. Combining these two pieces of information, the updated probability that the attacker is male is 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.92.}
