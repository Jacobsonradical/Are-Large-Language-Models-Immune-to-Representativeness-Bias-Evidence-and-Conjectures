Based on the Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being male as P(M), and the probability of the attacker being female as P(F).

From the information provided (b), we know that:
P(M) = 0.15
P(F) = 0.85

Let's denote the probability of the witness identifying a male as male as P(W|M) = 0.8 (from information a), and the probability of the witness identifying a female as male as P(W|F) = 0.2 (also from a).

We want to find P(M|W), the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

P(W) can be calculated as the sum of P(W|M)*P(M) and P(W|F)*P(F):
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26

So, P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.46

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.46.

Answer: {probability: 0.46}
