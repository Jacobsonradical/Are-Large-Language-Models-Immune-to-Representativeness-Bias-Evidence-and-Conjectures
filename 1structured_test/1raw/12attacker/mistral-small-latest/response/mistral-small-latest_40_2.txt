{probability: 0.58, explanation: This is a conditional probability problem. We want to find the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male. We can use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B). Here, A is the event that the attacker is male, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. P(A) is 0.15 (15% of the population is male). P(B|A) is 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies males 80% of the time). P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A). P(not A) is 0.85, and P(B|not A) is 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies females as males 20% of the time). Substituting these values into the formula, we get P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.58.}
