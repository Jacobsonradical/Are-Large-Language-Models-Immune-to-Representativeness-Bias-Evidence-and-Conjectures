Based on the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Bayes' theorem states that P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

From the information:
P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is male or female.

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)

Since the witness correctly identifies a female in 80% of the cases, P(W|not M) = 0.8. And P(not M) = 1 - P(M) = 0.85.

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.71

Now we can calculate P(M|W):

P(M|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.71 â‰ˆ 0.1761

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.1761.
