{probability: 0.72,

Here's the reasoning behind this:

Given that the witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is 0.8.

However, we also know that the population in the city is 85% female and 15% male. This is the prior probability of the attacker being male before considering the witness's testimony.

To get the posterior probability (the probability of the attacker being male after considering the witness's testimony), we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

We know P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(M) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the attacker being male), and P(W) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male, regardless of whether the attacker is actually male or female).

Substituting these values into the equation gives P(M|W) â‰ˆ 0.72.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is 0.72.
