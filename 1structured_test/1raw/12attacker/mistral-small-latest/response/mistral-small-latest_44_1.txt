Based on the given information, let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is male.

Let's denote:
P(M) = probability that the attacker is male
P(F) = probability that the attacker is female
P(W|M) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male
P(W|F) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male given that the attacker is female
P(W) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male

We know from the problem:
P(M) = 0.15
P(F) = 0.85
P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the gender 80% of the time)
P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the gender as male 20% of the time)

We need to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

Plugging in the values:
P(M|W) ≈ [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
       ≈ 0.06 / (0.06 + 0.17)
       ≈ 0.06 / 0.23
       ≈ 0.2609

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.26.

Answer: {probability: 0.26}
