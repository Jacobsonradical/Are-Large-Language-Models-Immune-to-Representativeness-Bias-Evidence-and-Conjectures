{probability: 0.88, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female, there is an initial 15% probability that the attacker is male. However, the witness identified the attacker as male, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying gender. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed male, given the witness's identification, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The probability is approximately 0.88 or 88%.}
