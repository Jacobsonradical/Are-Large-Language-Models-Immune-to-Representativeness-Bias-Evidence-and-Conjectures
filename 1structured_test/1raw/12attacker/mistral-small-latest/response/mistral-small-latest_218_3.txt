{probability: 0.904, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker as male is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The likelihood of the witness identifying a female attacker as male is 0.1 (20% error rate). So, the probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.1)) = 0.904 or 90.4%.}
