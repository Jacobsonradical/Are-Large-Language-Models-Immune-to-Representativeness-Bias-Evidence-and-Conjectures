{probability: 0.875,
Explanation: We know that 85% of the population in the city is female and 15% is male. Let's calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness testimony.

First, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in identifying gender under similar conditions. They have an 80% chance of correctly identifying a male and a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying a female as male.

Given that 15% of the population is male, the probability that the witness correctly identified a male attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

However, we must also account for the possibility that the witness incorrectly identified a female attacker as male. Since 85% of the population is female, the probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Adding these probabilities together, we get 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. This represents the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's identification. However, we want this probability as a fraction of the total population, not just the identified subset.

So, to find the estimate of the probability that the attacker is male, we divide this probability by the sum of the probabilities of correctly identifying a male and incorrectly identifying a female: 0.29 / (0.29 + 0.85 * 0.8) = 0.875. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is 0.875.}
