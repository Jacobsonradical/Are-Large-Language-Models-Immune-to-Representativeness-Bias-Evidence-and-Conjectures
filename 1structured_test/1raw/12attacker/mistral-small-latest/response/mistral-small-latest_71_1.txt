{probability: 0.902, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is male given the witness's identification. The prior probability of a male attacker is 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female). The likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time). The probability of the witness identifying a female as male is 0.1 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time). Therefore, the posterior probability of the attacker being male is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.1)) = 0.902. This means there is a 90.2% probability that the attacker is male.}
