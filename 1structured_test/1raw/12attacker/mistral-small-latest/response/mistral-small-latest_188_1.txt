{probability: 0.89, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that they are male is 0.8 (80% accuracy). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that they are female is 0.2 (20% error rate). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified them as male is approximately 0.89.}
