{probability: 0.72, explanation: The probability that the attacker is male can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows: M is the event that the attacker is male, W is the event that the witness identified the attacker as male. We want to find P(M|W), the probability of the attacker being male given that the witness identified him as male.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have: P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

From the problem statement, we know:
- P(M) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is female)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified male 80% of the time)
- P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified female as male 20% of the time)
- P(not M) = 1 - P(M) = 0.85

P(W) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|M)*P(M) + P(W|not M)*P(not M) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41

Now, we can find P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.41 â‰ˆ 0.72}
