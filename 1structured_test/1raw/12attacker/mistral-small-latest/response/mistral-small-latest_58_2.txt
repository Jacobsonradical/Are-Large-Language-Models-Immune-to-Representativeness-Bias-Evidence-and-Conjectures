Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is male.

Let M be the event that the attacker is male, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as male.

We want to find P(M|W), the probability that the attacker is male given that the witness identified the attacker as male.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)

From the given data:
- P(M) = 0.15 (15% of the population is male)
- P(W|M) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a male 80% of the time)
- P(W|not M) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a female as male 20% of the time)
- P(not M) = 0.85 (85% of the population is female)

We need to find P(W), which is the probability that the witness identifies any person as male. This can be calculated as follows:

P(W) = P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|not M) * P(not M)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     ≈ 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(M|W):

P(M|W) = P(W|M) * P(M) / P(W)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.41.

Final answer: {probability: 0.41}
