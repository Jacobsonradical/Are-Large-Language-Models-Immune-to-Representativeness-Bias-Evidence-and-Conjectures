{probability: 0.84, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem and the given probabilities. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15, and the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a male given that the person is actually male is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability of the attacker being male, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.84.}
