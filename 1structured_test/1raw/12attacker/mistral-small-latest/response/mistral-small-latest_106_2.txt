{probability: 0.92, explanation: Given that the attacker came from the city where 85% of the population is female, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time, so the probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified him as male, is 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.92.}
