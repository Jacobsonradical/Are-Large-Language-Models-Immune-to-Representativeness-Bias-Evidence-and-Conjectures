{probability: 0.52, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]. Given that the attacker is male, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male is 0.8. The probability of the attacker being male in the population is 0.15. The probability of the witness identifying a female as male is 0.2, and the probability of the attacker being female is 0.85. So, P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.52.}
