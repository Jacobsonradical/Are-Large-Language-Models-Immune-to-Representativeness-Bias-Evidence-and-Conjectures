{probability: 0.57, based on Bayes' theorem, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (15% of the population), and the likelihood of the witness identifying a male attacker correctly is 0.8 (80% of the time). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.57.}
