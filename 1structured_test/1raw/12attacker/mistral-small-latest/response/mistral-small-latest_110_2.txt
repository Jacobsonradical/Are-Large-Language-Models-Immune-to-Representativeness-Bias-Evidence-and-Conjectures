{probability: 0.54, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15 (given by the population distribution). The likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8 (given by the witness's accuracy). The probability of the witness identifying a female as male is 0.1 (1 - 0.9, where 0.9 is the witness's accuracy in identifying females). Therefore, the posterior probability of the attacker being male is approximately 0.54.}
