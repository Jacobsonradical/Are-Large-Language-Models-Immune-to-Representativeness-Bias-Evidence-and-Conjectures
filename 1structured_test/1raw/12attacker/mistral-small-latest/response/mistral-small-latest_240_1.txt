{probability: 0.55, This probability is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being male, given that 85% of the population is female, is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness identifying a male as male is 0.8 (80% accuracy). So, the posterior probability of the attacker being male, given that the witness identified the attacker as male, is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.55.}
