{probability: 0.875}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume the attacker's gender is equally likely to be male or female, given that the victim couldn't see the attacker.
2. So, based on the city's population distribution, there's an initial probability of 0.15 that the attacker is male and 0.85 that the attacker is female.
3. The witness correctly identifies gender 80% of the time. So, if the attacker is male, there's an 80% chance the witness will identify him as male. This gives us a probability of 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
4. If the attacker is female, the witness has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying her as male. This gives us a probability of 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.
5. The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as male is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 (correct identification of a male attacker) + 0.17 (incorrect identification of a female attacker) = 0.29.
6. However, we know from the question that the witness did identify the attacker as male. So, we need to adjust our probability based on this new information. This is a conditional probability problem.
7. The probability that the attacker is male, given that the witness identified him as male, is the probability of the witness identifying a male attacker as male divided by the total probability of the witness identifying anyone as male. That is, 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.875.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is male is approximately 0.875.
