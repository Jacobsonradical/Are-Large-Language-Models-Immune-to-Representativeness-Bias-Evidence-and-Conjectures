{probability: 0.74,

Explanation:

Let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement and the population gender distribution.

1. Prior probability (P(M)): The probability that the attacker is male based on the city's population distribution (15%).
   P(M) = 0.15

2. Likelihood (P(W|M)): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is indeed male. This is 80%, as stated in the problem.
   P(W|M) = 0.80

3. Likelihood (P(W|F)): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as male given that the attacker is actually female. This is the error rate, which is 20% of the female half of the sample.
   P(W|F) = 0.10

4. Prior probability (P(F)): The probability that the attacker is female based on the city's population distribution (85%).
   P(F) = 0.85

5. Apply Bayes' Theorem:
   P(M|W) = [P(W|M) * P(M)] / [P(W|M) * P(M) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

6. Plug in the values:
   P(M|W) ≈ [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.10 * 0.85)]
           ≈ 0.74

So, the probability that the attacker is male, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.74.
