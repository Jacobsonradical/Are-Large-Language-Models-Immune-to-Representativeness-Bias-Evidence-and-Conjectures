{probability: 0.552, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is female and 15% is male, the prior probability of the attacker being male is 0.15. The witness correctly identified gender 80% of the time under similar conditions, so the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is male is 0.8. Using Bayes' theorem, P(male|witness) = P(witness|male) * P(male) / P(witness), where P(witness) = P(witness|male) * P(male) + P(witness|female) * P(female). Assuming the witness's error rate is similar for males and females, P(witness|female) = 1 - P(witness|male) = 0.2. Since 85% of the population is female, P(female) = 0.85. Plugging these values into the equation, we get P(male|witness) â‰ˆ 0.552.}
