To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the local neighborhood distribution where the attack occurred, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Here's how we can set this up:

Let:
- \( P(T) \) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(N) \) be the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(L) \) be the probability based on local neighborhood data that a random person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) be the probability based on local neighborhood data that a random person is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) \) is proportionately represented by the neighborhood:
  - \( P(T) = 0.20 \)
  - \( P(N) = 0.80 \)

From the prior outside information of the neighborhood, it's also consistent with the local observation, so we don't seem to need adjustment from the general city data.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, the prior information directly from the local data can be used. Therefore, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is directly:

\[ P(T) = 0.20 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
