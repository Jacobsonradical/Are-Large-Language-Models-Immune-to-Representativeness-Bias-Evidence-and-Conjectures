Given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood data.

Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.20 \) (probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.80 \) (probability that a person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm)

Because the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we don't have updated evidence that changes our prior probabilities. Thus, the estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller remains the same as the prior probability in the neighborhood.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
