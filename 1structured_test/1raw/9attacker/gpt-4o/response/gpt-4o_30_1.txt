To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood's height distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \) be the event of the attack occurring in the neighborhood.

We know from the information provided that:
- \( P(T|N) \) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood's population distribution.
- \( P(T) \) = prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15.
- \( P(N|T) \) = probability that an attack happens in the neighborhood given that the person is 185 cm or taller (this can be assumed as the distribution for simplicity) = 0.20.
- \( P(N) \) = probability that an attack happens in the neighborhood (this would be the overall height distribution in the neighborhood):
  \[ P(N) = (P(N|T) \cdot P(T)) + (P(N|T^c) \cdot P(T^c)) \]
  where \( P(T^c) = 0.85 \) and \( P(N|T^c) = 0.80 \).

First, let's calculate \( P(N) \):
\[ P(N) = (0.20 \times 0.15) + (0.80 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(N) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(N) = 0.71 \]

Now using Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T|N) \):
\[ P(T|N) = \frac{P(N|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(N)} \]
\[ P(T|N) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(T|N) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(T|N) \approx 0.0423 \]

Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.0423}
