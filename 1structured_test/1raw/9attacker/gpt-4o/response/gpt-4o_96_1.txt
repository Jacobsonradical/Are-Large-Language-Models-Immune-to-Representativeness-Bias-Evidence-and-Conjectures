To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that they were in the neighborhood where 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller, we use the information provided directly about the neighborhood's demographics without needing the city-wide statistics.

The relevant probability given the neighborhood demographics is:

{probability: 0.20}
