To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the incident occurred in a specific neighborhood with different height proportions, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the attack happened in the specific neighborhood.

From the problem:
- \( P(A) \) = 0.15 (overall population proportion of people 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A') \) = 0.85 (overall population proportion of people shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(A|B) \) = 0.20 (proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood).
- \( P(A'|B) \) = 0.80 (proportion of people shorter than 185 cm in the neighborhood).

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), which is already given as 0.20. 

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the attack occurred in the specified neighborhood, is:

{probability: 0.20}
