To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the context of the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we need to use the information specific to that neighborhood. 

According to the information, in the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
