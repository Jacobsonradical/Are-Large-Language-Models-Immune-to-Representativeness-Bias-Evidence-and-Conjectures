Given the information:

1. In the city:
   - 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
   - 15% are 185 cm or taller.

2. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
   - 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
   - 20% are 185 cm or taller.

We are tasked with finding out the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, considering that the attack occurred in a neighborhood with a specific height distribution.

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, we should use the provided neighborhood statistics. Therefore, the proportion of the neighborhood population that is 185 cm or taller is 20%.

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
