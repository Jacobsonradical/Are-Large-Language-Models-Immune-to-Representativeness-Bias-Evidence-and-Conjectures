To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information about the neighborhood, we can use the prior distribution of heights in that neighborhood.

Given:
- 80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we base our estimate solely on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is directly given by the proportion of people in the neighborhood who fall into that height category.
