To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. According to the data, in the neighborhood where the attack took place:

- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller

Given this information, the best estimate we can make without additional details is the proportion of the neighborhood population that meets the height criteria. Hence, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is directly given by the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}
