To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information about the neighborhood's population, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's set up the problem with the relevant probabilities.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given, we have:
- \( P(A) = 0.20 \) (probability that a random person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.80 \) (probability that a random person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm)

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we consider any person in the neighborhood equally likely to be the attacker. Thus, we want to find \( P(A) \), which is directly given as the prior probability.

Here, there is no additional evidence to update our prior probability, so the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller remains the same as the prior probability based on the neighborhood data.

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
