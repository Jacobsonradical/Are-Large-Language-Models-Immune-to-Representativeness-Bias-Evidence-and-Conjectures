To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

From the information given about the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we are given that the neighborhood's demographics specifically, we will use this information directly. No additional computation is necessary because the victim could not see the attacker's height, so we rely solely on the proportion from the neighborhood demographic.

Thus, the estimate is based on the neighborhood's distribution:

{probability: 0.20}
