Given the information about the population and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, we need to update our estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood data. 

According to the neighborhood statistics:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the question relates to the specific neighborhood's probabilities, we should use the neighborhood data for our estimate.

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 20%.

So, in the requested format:

{probability: 0.20}
