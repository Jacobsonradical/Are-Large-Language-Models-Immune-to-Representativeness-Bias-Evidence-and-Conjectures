To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the specified neighborhood.

From the given information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \): The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A') = 0.85 \): The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(B|A) = 0.20 \): The probability that a person is in the neighborhood given they are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A') = 0.80 \): The probability that a person is in the neighborhood given they are shorter than 185 cm.

To find \( P(A|B) \), we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A')} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.15}{0.20 \times 0.15 + 0.80 \times 0.85} \]

Calculate the numerator:

\[ 0.20 \times 0.15 = 0.03 \]

Calculate the denominator:

\[ 0.20 \times 0.15 + 0.80 \times 0.85 = 0.03 + 0.68 = 0.71 \]

So,

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \approx 0.0423 \]

Therefore,

{probability: 0.0423}
