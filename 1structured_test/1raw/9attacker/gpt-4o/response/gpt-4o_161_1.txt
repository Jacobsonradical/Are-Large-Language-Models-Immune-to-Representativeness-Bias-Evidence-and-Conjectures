Certainly, let's use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the events as follows:
- Let \(A\) be the event that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \(B\) be the event that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \(E\) be the event that the attacker is from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

The probability we are looking for is \(P(B|E)\).

From the provided information:
- \(P(A) = 0.15\) (15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(B) = 0.20\) (20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(E) = 1\) (the attacker is from the neighborhood where the attack occurred).

Since the probability the attacker is from the neighborhood is 1, we directly use the probability for the neighborhood:
- \(P(B) = 0.20\).

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, is:
{probability: 0.20}
