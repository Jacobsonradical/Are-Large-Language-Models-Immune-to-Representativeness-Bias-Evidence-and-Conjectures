To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. The provided data states that in this neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Given this information, the best estimate we have is the proportion of people 185 cm or taller in that specific neighborhood. Therefore, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}
