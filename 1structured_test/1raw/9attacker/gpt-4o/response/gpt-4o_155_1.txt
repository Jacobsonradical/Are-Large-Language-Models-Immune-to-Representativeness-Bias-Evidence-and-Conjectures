To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, you can use the proportion from that neighborhood. According to the investigation, in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
