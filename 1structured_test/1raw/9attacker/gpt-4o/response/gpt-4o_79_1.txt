To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here, we need to consider the prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller and the likelihood that the attacker is from the given neighborhood. 

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the person is from the neighborhood where the incident occurred.

We are interested in finding \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are from the neighborhood.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

From the problem:
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that any randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that someone who is 185 cm or taller is from the neighborhood. Since this doesn't provide additional information beyond what's already known in the neighborhood's statistics, this just reflects the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.20.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of being from the neighborhood, which doesn't change the makeup but is given by the neighborhood's general proportions. Thus we use the overall proportion of people shorter than 185 cm (0.80) and 185 cm or taller (0.20).

Given:
\[ P(A) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(B|A) = 0.20 \]

To find \( P(B) \), consider the total probability of being in the neighborhood:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
where \( \neg A \) is the event that someone is shorter than 185 cm, hence:
\[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \]

Given \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.80 \), we have:
\[ P(B) = 0.20 \times 0.15 + 0.80 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.20 \times 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.0423.
