To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayesian reasoning. Specifically, we want to take into account the prior probabilities from the city's general population and update them based on the neighborhood-specific probabilities.

Let's denote:
- \( A \): Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): Event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the city-wide data, we have:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)

However, we are interested in the neighborhood probabilities, which are:
- \( P(A_{nb}) = 0.20 \) (probability of being 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood)
- \( P(B_{nb}) = 0.80 \) (probability of being shorter than 185 cm in the neighborhood)

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should focus on the neighborhood-specific probabilities. Given no other information about the attacker, the relevant probabilities for our estimate are those of the neighborhood.

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is directly:

\[ {probability: 0.20} \]

So, based on the neighborhood-specific information, the estimated probability is 0.20.
