To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the more localized data from the neighborhood, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( A_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( B \): The attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We need to calculate \( P(A_1|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack happened in the neighborhood.

From the problem statement, we have the following probabilities:
\[ P(A_1) = 0.20 \, \] (20% of the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller)
\[ P(A_2) = 0.80 \, \] (80% of the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_1|B) = \frac{P(B|A_1)P(A_1)}{P(B)} \]

However, since our data specifies the proportions directly in the neighborhood rather than conditional on the attack occurring, and \( B \) represents the event "being in the neighborhood" (which is constant for all people in the neighborhood), this simplifies our calculation. In this scenario, \( P(B|A_1) = P(B|A_2) = 1 \), and \( P(B) \) does not alter the ratio. Thus, in a given neighborhood, the direct proportion can be taken as:

\[ P(A_1|B) = P(A_1) = 0.20 \]

Therefore:

{probability: 0.20}
