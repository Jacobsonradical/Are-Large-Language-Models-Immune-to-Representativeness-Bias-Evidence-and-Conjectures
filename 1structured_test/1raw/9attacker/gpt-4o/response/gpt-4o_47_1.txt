To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information given, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is formulated as follows:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of event A given that event B is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of event B given that event A is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of event A.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of event B.

In this context:
- Let A be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- Let B be the event "the attack occurred in the neighborhood."

Given:
- The prior probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, \( P(A) \), is 20% or 0.20.
- The prior probability that a person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm is 80% or 0.80.
- We need to determine whether the general city information influences our estimate of \( P(A|B) \).

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, and given no other distinguishing information, we rely on the neighborhood statistics rather than city-wide statistics. Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller directly uses the neighborhood probability.

So:
\[ P(A|B) = P(\text{attacker is 185 cm or taller | attack happened in neighborhood}) = 0.20 \]

Therefore:
{probability: 0.20}

This uses the straightforward application of the available neighborhood statistics.
