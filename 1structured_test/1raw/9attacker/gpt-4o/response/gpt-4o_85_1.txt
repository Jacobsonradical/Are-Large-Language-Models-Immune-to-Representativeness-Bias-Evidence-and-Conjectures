To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15.
- \( P(B|A) \): The conditional probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood given the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.20.
- \( P(B|A') \): The conditional probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.80.
- \( P(A') \): The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85.

We can compute \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A'). \]
\[ P(B) = (0.20 \times 0.15) + (0.80 \times 0.85). \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68. \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71. \]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}. \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.15}{0.71}. \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71}. \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423. \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.0423.
