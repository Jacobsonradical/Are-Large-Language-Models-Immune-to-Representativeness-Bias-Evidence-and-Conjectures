To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This accounts for the context of the crime more accurately.

In the neighborhood, the distribution of heights is:
- 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Since we lack any other specific information about the attacker, the best estimate we have reflects these proportions.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, which can be expressed as:

{probability: 0.2}
