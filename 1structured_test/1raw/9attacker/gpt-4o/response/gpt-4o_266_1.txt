To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here, our prior beliefs are based on the city's overall population, and the new evidence is based on the neighborhood's population where the attack occurred.

Let's denote the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller in the city (\(0.15\)).
- \( P(B) \): Probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood (\(0.20\)).
- \( P(A|B) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

However, since \( P(B|A) \) is essentially just \( P(A) \) in this context (as we are considering the probability of being 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood directly), we can directly consider the updated probability given the new context, which is simply the neighborhood's statistics.

Thus, given the neighborhood's data:
\[ P(\text{attacker is 185 cm or taller}) = 0.20 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability:}~0.20 \} \]
