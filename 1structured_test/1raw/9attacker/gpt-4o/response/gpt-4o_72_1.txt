Given the information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to update our belief based on the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We are given:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
- \( P(A|B) \): The probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that a person is in the neighborhood, given that they are 185 cm or taller. Since we don't have additional information contrary to what's given, we can reasonably assume it to be equal to \( P(A|B) = 0.20 \).

To find \( P(A|B) \), we can use the fact that the neighborhood probability distribution is given directly:
\[ P(A|B) = 0.20 \]

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, is:
\[ \{ probability: 0.20 \} \]

So, the estimate is:
\[ \{ probability: 0.20 \} \]
