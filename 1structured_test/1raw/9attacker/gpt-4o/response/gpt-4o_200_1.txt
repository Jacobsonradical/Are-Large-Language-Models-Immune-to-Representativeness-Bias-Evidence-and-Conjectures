Given the information, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood data where the attack occurred. We can use Bayes' Theorem for this estimation.

Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attack occurred in the neighborhood.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood given the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, \( P(B|A) \) is 1.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.20 or 20%.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, combining both groups.

To find \( P(B) \), we sum the probabilities considering both groups in the neighborhood:
\[ P(B) = P(B \text{ and shorter than 185 cm}) + P(B \text{ and 185 cm or taller}) \]

Given:
- \( P(\text{shorter than 185 cm}) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\text{185 cm or taller}) = 0.20 \)

Since we know the attack happened in the neighborhood, we can directly use these probabilities:
\[ P(B) = 0.80 + 0.20 = 1 \]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{185 cm or taller}|\text{Attack occurred in neighborhood}) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.20}{1} \]
\[ P(\text{185 cm or taller}|\text{Attack occurred in neighborhood}) = 0.20 \]

So the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
