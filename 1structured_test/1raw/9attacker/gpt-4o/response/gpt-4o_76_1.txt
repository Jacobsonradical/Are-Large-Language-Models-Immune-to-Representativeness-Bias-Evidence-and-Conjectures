To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This information tells us that 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
