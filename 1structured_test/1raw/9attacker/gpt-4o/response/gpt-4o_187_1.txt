To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use the neighborhood-specific data since the attack took place in that particular area.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

There is no other information provided that skews the probability towards a particular height group. Therefore, we can directly use the given data:

{probability: 0.20}
