To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the neighborhood data, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how:

### Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of an event A (attacker's height 185 cm or taller), given as 20% or 0.20.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of observing evidence B (the attack occurred in the neighborhood) given that A is true. This can be considered 1 since the event B is just the context of the attack rather than new evidence.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of evidence B (the attack occurred in the neighborhood).

Here, \( P(B) \) can be considered 1 because the attack definitely occurred in the neighborhood. Therefore,

\[ P(\text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} | \text{in the neighborhood}) = P(\text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.20 \]

So the posterior probability is the same as the prior probability.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.20 \} \]
