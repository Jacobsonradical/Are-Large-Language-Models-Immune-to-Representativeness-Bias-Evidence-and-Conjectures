To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( H_1 \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood.

Breaking it down, we need to find:
- \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood.
- \( P(E \mid H_1) \): The probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the attack in the neighborhood.

Given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.20 \) (20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E \mid H_1) = 1 \) (since the attacker being 185 cm or taller has no bearing on the attack occurring in the neighborhood given this setup).

Next, we need to calculate \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of an attack occurring in the neighborhood. It's given by:

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E \mid H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

where \( H_2 \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We assume \( P(E \mid H_2) = 1 \) (similar reasoning as above; the attack occurring independently of the height).

So,
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E \mid H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = 1 \cdot 0.20 + 1 \cdot 0.80 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.20 + 0.80 = 1 \]

Now substituting these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.20}{1} = 0.20 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
