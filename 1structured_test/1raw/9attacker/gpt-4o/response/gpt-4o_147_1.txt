To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information that is most relevant to the specific location where the attack took place, which is the neighborhood statistics.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Given that the attack happened in this neighborhood, we will base our estimate on these local statistics.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
