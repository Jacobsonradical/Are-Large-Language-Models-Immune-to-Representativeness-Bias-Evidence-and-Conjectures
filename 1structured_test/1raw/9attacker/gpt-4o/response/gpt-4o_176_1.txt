To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information about the city's population and the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- P(A): Probability that someone in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15.
- P(B): Probability that someone in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller = 0.20.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We will assume that the population structure of the neighborhood is representative of the potential attackers. Therefore, we will use the neighborhood distribution directly:

The probability that someone in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm is P(~B) = 1 - P(B) = 0.80.

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the neighborhood distribution, is:

{probability: 0.20}
