To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Define the following events:
- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

We know the following:
- \( P(A | B) \): The probability we want to estimate, i.e., the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.
- \( P(B | A) = 1 \): If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, it's certain that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that a randomly selected person from the city is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that a randomly selected person from the city is shorter than 185 cm. (Note: \( A^c \) is the complement of event \( A \))
- \( P(B | A^c) \): The probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood given that the person is shorter than 185 cm. From the neighborhood data, 80% are shorter than 185 cm, thus \( P(B | A^c) = 0.8 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.15 + 0.8 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.15 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.83 \]

Now calculate \( P(A | B) \):

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.15}{0.83} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.15}{0.83} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.1807 \]

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1807}
