To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information about the neighborhood, we will use the proportion provided for the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

According to the information provided:

- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
  - 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
  - 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since this attack happened in this specific neighborhood, we will use these neighborhood statistics directly to estimate the probability. 

Thus, given that the attack happened in this neighborhood, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}

or in other format:

{probability: 1 in 5 or 20%}.
