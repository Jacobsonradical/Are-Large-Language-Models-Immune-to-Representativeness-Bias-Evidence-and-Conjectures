We're interested in estimating the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided about the neighborhood.

Let's denote the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \): The attacker is from the neighborhood.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(A | \text{City}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(A | \text{Neighborhood}) = 0.20 \)

Given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we are concerned with \( P(A | N) \).

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we consider the probability distribution of heights in the neighborhood:

\[
P(A | N) = 0.20
\]

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\{probability: 0.20\}
