To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with known population height distribution, we will use Bayes' theorem.

We define:
- \(A\) as the event that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
- \(B\) as the event that a person from the neighborhood is the attacker.

Given:
- \(P(A) = 0.20\) (probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(A') = 0.80\) (probability that a person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm)

Without additional evidence or any other indication (like height-related clues), we can assume the probabilities in the neighborhood are directly applicable to this case.

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:
\[ P(A \mid B) = P(A) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A \mid B) = 0.20 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
