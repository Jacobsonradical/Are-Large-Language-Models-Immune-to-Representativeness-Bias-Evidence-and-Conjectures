To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. According to the problem, in that neighborhood:

- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we have to base our estimate on the neighborhood data, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
