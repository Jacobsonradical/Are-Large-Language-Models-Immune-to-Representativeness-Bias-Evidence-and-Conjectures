To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the new information about the neighborhood, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( N \) be the event that the attack occurred in the given neighborhood.

We want to calculate \( P(H|N) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|N) = \frac{P(N|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(N)} \]

Where:
- \( P(N|H) \) is the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that someone is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(N) \) is the overall probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, regardless of the height.

Given the information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(N|H) = 0.20 \) (since 20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller)
- The overall probability \( P(N) \) can be broken down into two parts, based on the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood:

\[ P(N) = P(N \cap H) + P(N \cap H') \]
\[      = P(N|H)P(H) + P(N|H')P(H') \]

Where:
- \( P(H') = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the cityâ€™s population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(N|H') = 0.80 \) (since 80% of the neighborhood's population is shorter than 185 cm)

Thus:
\[ P(N) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[      = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[      = 0.71 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|N) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H|N) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H|N) \approx 0.042 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.042}
