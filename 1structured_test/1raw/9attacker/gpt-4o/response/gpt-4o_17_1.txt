To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, we will use the information about the neighborhood's population.

According to the problem statement, in the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack took place in this neighborhood, we use the neighborhood-specific probabilities. The probability that a randomly selected person (or the attacker, in this case) is 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood is 20%, or \(0.2\).

Hence, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.2}
