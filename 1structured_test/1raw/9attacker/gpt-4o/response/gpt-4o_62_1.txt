To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let's define:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \) as the event referring to the neighborhood statistics.

We are looking for \( P(T|N) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood data.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (the general population probability that someone is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(N|T) = 0.2 \) (the probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(N) \) is the general probability of the neighborhood data, derived by considering both height groups.

We can compute \( P(N) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(N) = P(N|T) \cdot P(T) + P(N|T^c) \cdot P(T^c) \]
Where:
- \( P(T^c) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85 \) (the general population probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(N|T^c) = 0.8 \) (the probability that a person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, substituting these values:
\[ P(N) = (0.2 \cdot 0.15) + (0.8 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(N) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(N) = 0.71 \]

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|N) = \frac{P(N|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(N)} \]
\[ P(T|N) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(T|N) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(T|N) \approx 0.0423 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.0423}
