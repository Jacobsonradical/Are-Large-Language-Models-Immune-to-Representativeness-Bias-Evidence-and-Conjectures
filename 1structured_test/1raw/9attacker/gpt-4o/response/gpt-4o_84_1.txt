Given that 80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller, and the attack happened in this neighborhood, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by using the given neighborhood statistics directly since the victim did not see the attacker's height.

Thus, the probability estimate is:

{probability: 0.2}
