Given the context-specific data from the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we would use this information to estimate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% are 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in this neighborhood is, therefore, 0.20.

Thus, your estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
