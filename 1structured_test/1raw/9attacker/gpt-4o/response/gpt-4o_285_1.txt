To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( B \) be the event that the attack occurred in the neighborhood with the given height distribution.

We want to find \( P(A | B) \):

- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the general population, which is 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(A | B) \) is the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack happened in the neighborhood with the specified height distribution.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability that the attacker is in the neighborhood given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.20 (20%).
- \( P(B | A^c) \) is the probability that the attacker is in the neighborhood given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.80 (80%).

By Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B | A)P(A) + P(B | A^c)P(A^c) \]

Where \( P(A^c) \) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm in the general population, which is 0.85 (85%).

Now we plug in the values:
\[ P(B) = (0.20 * 0.15) + (0.80 * 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now we can find \( P(A | B) \):
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.20 * 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A | B) = 0.0423 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
{probability: 0.0423}
