To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood statistics, we use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the attacker is from this specific neighborhood.

First, let's define the probabilities:

1. The probability that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(A) = 0.20 \]

2. The probability that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm:
\[ P(\neg A) = 0.80 \]

3. Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, we assume:
\[ P(B|A) = 1 \] 
(meaning if the person is in the neighborhood, the probability of the person being from this neighborhood is 100%).

Now, we need the probability that the attacker is from the specific neighborhood, given no other information.
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \cdot 0.20 + 1 \cdot 0.80 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.20 + 0.80 \]
\[ P(B) = 1 \]

Finally, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Substituting in the values:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.20}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.20 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
