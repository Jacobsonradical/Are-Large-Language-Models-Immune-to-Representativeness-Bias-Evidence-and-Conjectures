To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information provided, we need to use the information about the neighborhood where the attack took place, since it is more specific to the event.

According to the neighborhood data:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we have no additional information to differentiate the attacker from the general neighborhood population, we will use the proportion of the neighborhood population in our estimate.

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller can be directly taken from the neighborhood data:

{probability: 0.20}
