To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information provided about the neighborhood:

1. **Population Prior Probability:**
   - P(Taller): The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
   - P(Shorter): The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

2. **Neighborhood Conditional Probability:**
   - P(Taller | Neighborhood): The probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller = 0.20
   - P(Shorter | Neighborhood): The probability that a person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm = 0.80

Given that the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, we utilize the neighborhood probabilities for our estimate. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (from the neighborhood data) is:

P(Attacker Taller) = P(Taller | Neighborhood) = 0.20

Therefore, the estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}
