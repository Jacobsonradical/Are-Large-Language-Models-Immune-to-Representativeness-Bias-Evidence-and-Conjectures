To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we need to consider the proportion of people with the given heights in that specific area.

From the neighborhood data:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, we should use these proportions to estimate the probability.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is given by the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.20}
