To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack took place at night and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we should consider the distribution of heights in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

Since the police investigation provides the relevant data for that particular neighborhood, we will use those statistics. According to the investigation, in this neighborhood:

- 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller should be directly based on the given neighborhood data.
