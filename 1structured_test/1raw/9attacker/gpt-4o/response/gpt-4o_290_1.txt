Given the contextual information and how the distributions change in the neighborhood, we will calculate the probability based on Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of people are 185 cm or taller and 80% are shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), i.e., the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (probability someone from the city is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.20 \) (probability the attack occurred in the neighborhood given the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A') = 0.80 \) (probability the attack occurred in the neighborhood given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm). Where \( A' \) denotes the complement of \( A \), i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Now we need \( P(B) \), the total probability the attack occurred in the neighborhood:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.20)(0.15) + (0.80)(0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.20)(0.15)}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.0423}
