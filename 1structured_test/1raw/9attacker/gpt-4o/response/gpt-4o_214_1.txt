To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood-specific data, we use the given information for the neighborhood where the attack occurred, because it is more relevant to the question at hand.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

So, the probability that a randomly chosen person in this neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%).

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
