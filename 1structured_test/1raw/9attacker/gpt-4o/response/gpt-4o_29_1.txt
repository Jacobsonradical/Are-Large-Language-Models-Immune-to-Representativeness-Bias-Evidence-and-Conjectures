To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the neighborhood has 80% of people shorter than 185 cm and 20% of people 185 cm or taller, we use the provided local demographic information.

According to the neighborhood statistics:

- The probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm is 80% or 0.80.
- The probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller is 20% or 0.20.

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, these are the probabilities we should consider.

Therefore:
{probability: 0.20}
