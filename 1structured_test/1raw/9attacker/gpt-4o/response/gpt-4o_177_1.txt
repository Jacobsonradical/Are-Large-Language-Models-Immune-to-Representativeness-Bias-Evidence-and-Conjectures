To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the specific data from the neighborhood where the attack occurred. According to the information provided:

- 80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Given that the victim could not see the attacker's height, we should use the relative population proportions from the neighborhood without additional specific evidence to guide us. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Hence, the estimate of the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
