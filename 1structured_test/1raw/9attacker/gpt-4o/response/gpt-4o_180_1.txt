To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

According to the data: 
- 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, these proportions represent the best estimate we have regarding the attacker's height.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%.

In the required format:

{probability: 0.2}
