To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a particular neighborhood, we can use the information provided about the heights of people in that neighborhood. In this neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Given this information, the probability that a random person (in this case, the attacker) from this neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

So, our estimate of the probability is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal format.
