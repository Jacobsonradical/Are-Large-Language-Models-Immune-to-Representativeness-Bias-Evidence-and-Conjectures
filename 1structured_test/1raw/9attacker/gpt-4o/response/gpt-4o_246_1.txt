To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we rely on the neighborhood-specific probability rather than the city-wide probability. 

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
