To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This requires updating our beliefs using the neighborhood-specific probabilities provided by the police investigation.

Given the information:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

We don't have any other specific information about the attacker, so we will rely on these neighborhood probabilities.

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is directly given by the neighborhood statistics.

Thus, the probability \( P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) \) is:

\[ \boxed{0.20} \]

{probability: 0.20}
