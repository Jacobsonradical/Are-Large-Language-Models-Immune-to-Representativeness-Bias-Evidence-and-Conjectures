To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack took place in a specific neighborhood, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can set it up:

Let's define the following:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attack happened in the specific neighborhood.

From the information given:
- In the city, \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% are shorter than 185 cm).

In the neighborhood:
- Given that the attack happened in the neighborhood, \( P(A|B) = 0.20 \) (20% are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A|B) = 0.80 \) (80% are shorter than 185 cm).

To find \( P(A|B) \), we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

However, in this setup, \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) are essentially the probabilities given the neighborhood distributions, and we can use them directly since \( B \) represents the event happening in the neighborhood:

- \( P(B|A) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.80 \)

The total probability \( P(B) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.20 \times 0.15) + (0.80 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0423}
