To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood statistics, we will use Bayesian reasoning.

Let's denote:
- \( H \geq 185 \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H < 185 \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the neighborhood information:
- \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(H < 185) = 0.80 \)

Since we have no other information to update or change these probabilities based on the nature of the attack itself (i.e., the victim could not see the attacker's height), we use the neighborhood distribution directly.

Thus, the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is exactly the neighborhood proportion:

\[ P(H \geq 185) = 0.20 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
