To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack took place, since that gives us a more accurate context for the probabilities. 

According to the neighborhood data, the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.20.

So, without any other specific details about the attacker, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the proportion of people in the neighborhood of that height.

Therefore, the probability estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}
