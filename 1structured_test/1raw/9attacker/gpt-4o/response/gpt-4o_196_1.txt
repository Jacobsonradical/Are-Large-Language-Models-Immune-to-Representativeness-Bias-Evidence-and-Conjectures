Given the information, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood's height distribution.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( C \): The attack occurred in the neighborhood.

The prior probabilities based on the neighborhood distribution are:
- \( P(A) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.80 \)

Since the estimate should reflect only the neighborhood distribution, we don't need the city-wide population heights for this calculation.

We are interested in the posterior probability \( P(A | C) \). Given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood and we have its population height distribution, we use the neighborhood's probabilities directly.

Hence, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the height distribution in the neighborhood is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the estimate is:
{probability: 0.20}
