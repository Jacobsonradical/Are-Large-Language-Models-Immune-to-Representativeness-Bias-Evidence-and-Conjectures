To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Specifically, we're interested in the posterior probability \( P(H | E) \), where \( E \) is the event that the attack happened in the neighborhood where we have additional height distribution information, and \( H \) is the event that a person is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- In the city:
  - \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
  - \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- In the specific neighborhood:
  - \( P(H | N) = 0.20 \)
  - \( P(\neg H | N) = 0.80 \)
- The attack happened in the neighborhood \( N \), so \( P(N) = 1 \)

We want to find \( P(H | E) \) considering the neighborhood \( N \):

Since \( E \) represents the information pertinent to the neighborhood, we can simplify our focus on the conditional probabilities within \( N \).

\[ P(H | E) = P(H | N) = 0.20 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the event occurred in the neighborhood with the provided height distribution, is:

{probability: 0.20}
