Given the information provided, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood statistics. 

In the neighborhood, the probabilities are:
- The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm (\(P(Shorter)\)) = 80% = 0.8
- The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (\(P(Taller)\)) = 20% = 0.2

Since the new information is specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we should use these neighborhood statistics to estimate the attacker's height probability.

Since we are assuming the attacker's height follows the same distribution as the average person in the neighborhood, the probability we seek is directly:
{probability: 0.2}
