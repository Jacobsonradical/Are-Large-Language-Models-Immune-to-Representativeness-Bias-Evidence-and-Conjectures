To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian statistics. Here's a step-by-step approach to find the probability:

1. **Define the Events**:
   - Let's denote \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( B \) represent the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

2. **Given Probabilities**:
   - \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(B) \): The probability that a random person is from this specific neighborhood (implicitly normalized to be 1 in our calculation as we are considering only this neighborhood).
   - \( P(A | B) \): The probability that a person in this neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.

3. **Given Data**:
   - \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (city-wide probability).
   - \( P(A | B) = 0.20 \) (neighborhood-specific probability).

Using \( P(A | B) \) directly (since weâ€™re dealing only with this neighborhood probability):

Our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the attack happened in the neighborhood is:

\[ P(A | \text{attack in neighborhood}) = P(A | B) \]

Thus,

{probability: 0.20}
