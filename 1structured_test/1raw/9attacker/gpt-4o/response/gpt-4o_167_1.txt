To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the incident occurred in a specific neighborhood, we need to use the information about the distribution of heights in that neighborhood.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim did not see the attacker's height, we use these probabilities directly. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is directly given by the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
