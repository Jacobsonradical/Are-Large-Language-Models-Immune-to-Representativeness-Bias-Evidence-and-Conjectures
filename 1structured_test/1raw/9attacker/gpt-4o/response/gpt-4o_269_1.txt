To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood information, we can use the principles of conditional probability. Specifically, we use Bayes' Theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the attack happened in this specific neighborhood.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in this neighborhood.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \): The probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that a person of height 185 cm or taller is in the neighborhood.
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \): The probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that a shorter person is in the neighborhood.

Instead, we should consider the probabilities given specifically for the neighborhood:
- \( P(A|B) \): The probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller (which is what we need to estimate).

From the neighborhood data:
- \( P(A|B) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(\neg A|B) = 0.80 \)

Since \( P(A|B) \) directly gives us the desired probability from the neighborhood data, we don't need further calculations. Therefore:

{probability: 0.20}
