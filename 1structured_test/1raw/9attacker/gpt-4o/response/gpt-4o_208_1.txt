To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where the height distribution is known, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attack occurred in the neighborhood with the given height distribution.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that a randomly selected person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- \( P(\neg A) \): Probability that a randomly selected person in the city is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability that a person is in the neighborhood given they are 185 cm or taller = 0.20
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): Probability that a person is in the neighborhood given they are shorter than 185 cm = 0.80

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \), the total probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, is given by:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(B) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0423}
