To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where a known proportion of the population is 185 cm or taller, we use Bayes' Theorem.

We define:
- \( H \): Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \): Attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( N \): The event that the attack occurred in the specified neighborhood.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(H|N) = 0.20 \): Probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(L|N) = 0.80 \): Probability that a person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm.

Since no more information is provided concerning the specific characteristics of the attacker's height distribution separate from the neighborhood, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller purely based on being from this neighborhood is equal to the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is \(\boxed{0.20}\).
