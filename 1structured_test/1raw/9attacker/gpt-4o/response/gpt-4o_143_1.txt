To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the situation, we need to consider the neighborhood's height distribution where the attack occurred. Let's denote this probability as \( P(H_{attacker} \geq 185) \).

According to the neighborhood statistics:
- 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the neighborhood distribution where the attack occurred:

\( P(H_{attacker} \geq 185) = 0.20 \)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
