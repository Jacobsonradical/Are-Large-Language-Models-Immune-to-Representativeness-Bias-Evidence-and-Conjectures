To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the specific neighborhood statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the approach:

1. Denote the event that the person is 185 cm or taller as \( H \), and the event that the person is shorter than 185 cm as \( \neg H \).

2. Let \( P(H) \) be the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood, which is 0.20 (or 20%).
   
3. Let \( P(\neg H) \) be the prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm in the neighborhood, which is 0.80 (or 80%).

4. Without any specific evidence about the attacker's height, we assume that anyone in the neighborhood could equally likely be the attacker. Therefore, the likelihood of observing the attacker given height category \( H \) (or \( \neg H \)) is proportional to the neighborhood distribution.

Using Bayes' theorem, we consider:

\[ P(H|\text{attacker}) = \frac{P(\text{attacker}|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{attacker})} \]

Since we are not given any specific evidence regarding the observation of the attacker's height (i.e., the victim did not see it), \( P(\text{attacker}|H) \) and \( P(\text{attacker}|\neg H) \) can be considered equal. Therefore, the posterior probability \( P(H|\text{attacker}) \) ends up being equal to the prior probability:

\[ P(H|\text{attacker}) = P(H) = 0.20 \]
 
Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
