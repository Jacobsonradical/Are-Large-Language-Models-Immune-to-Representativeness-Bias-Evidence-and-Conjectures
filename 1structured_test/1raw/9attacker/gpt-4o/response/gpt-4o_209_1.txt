To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use the information specific to the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, as it's more relevant to this specific case.

Given:
- Probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm (city-wide): 85%
- Probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller (city-wide): 15%
- Probability that a person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm: 80%
- Probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller: 20%

We will use the neighborhood-specific probabilities:

- P(Shorter than 185 cm | Neighborhood) = 0.80
- P(185 cm or taller | Neighborhood) = 0.20

The police investigation leads us to focus on the neighborhood data. Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack took place in this specific neighborhood, is simply the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the probability estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}

This corresponds to the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.
