To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that we are in a specific neighborhood, we need to use the information specific to that neighborhood. 

In the neighborhood:
- The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm (\(P(\text{height} < 185)\)) is 0.80.
- The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (\(P(\text{height} \geq 185)\)) is 0.20.

Since we have no additional information to suggest that the attacker's height distribution deviates from the general population in the neighborhood, we can directly use the given probabilities.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
