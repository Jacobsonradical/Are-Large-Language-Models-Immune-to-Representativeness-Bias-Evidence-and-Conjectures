To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood's height distribution, we can use this information about the neighborhood specifically, since the attack occurred there.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller

Therefore, the probability \(P(T \geq 185)\) that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
