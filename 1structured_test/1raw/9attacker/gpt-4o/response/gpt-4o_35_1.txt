To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, rather than the general city statistics.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in this particular neighborhood, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who fall into that height category.

Therefore, the probability estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}
