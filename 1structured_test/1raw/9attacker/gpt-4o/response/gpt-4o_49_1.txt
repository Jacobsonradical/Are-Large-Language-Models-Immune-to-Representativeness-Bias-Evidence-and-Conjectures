To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the information about the neighborhood, we can use the given data and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that a person is from the neighborhood where 20% are 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are from the neighborhood.

From the neighborhood data:
- \( P(A) = 0.20 \), the probability that a randomly selected person from the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A^c) = 0.80 \), the probability that a randomly selected person from the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm.

Since we know nothing more about the attack, we assume the attacker is as likely to be anyone from the neighborhood as anyone else, i.e., the probability for the attacker's height is reflective of the general population height distribution in that neighborhood.

Thus, the probability estimate is:

\[
{probability: P(A) = 0.20}
\]
So, your estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
