To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller, we should use the neighborhood-specific data.

Here, the neighborhood distribution provides the best context-specific information to make the estimation.

In the neighborhood:
- The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.8.
- The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

Given that these probabilities directly reflect the characteristics of the local population where the attack occurred, we can use the local distribution for our estimation.

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
