To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the local neighborhood statistics, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Here are the steps for estimating the probability:

1. **Identify the probability of being 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood:**  
   Given: 20%

2. **Identify the probability of being shorter than 185 cm in the neighborhood:**
   Given: 80%

Since the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, we use the local neighborhood statistics directly without needing to compare them to the city's overall statistics. Therefore:

{probability: 0.20}

This means our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is \(0.20\) or 20%.
