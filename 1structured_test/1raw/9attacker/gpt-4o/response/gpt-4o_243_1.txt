Given the details, letâ€™s use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the attack happened in the specific neighborhood.

We want to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack happened in the specified neighborhood.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

### Given Data:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (Overall probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.20 \) (Probability that a 185 cm or taller person is in that neighborhood)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.80 \) (Probability that a shorter than 185 cm person is in that neighborhood)

### Total probability in the neighborhood \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) \).

So:
\[ P(\neg A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \]

\[ P(B) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 = 0.71 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.042 \]

Thus:

\{probability: 0.042\}
