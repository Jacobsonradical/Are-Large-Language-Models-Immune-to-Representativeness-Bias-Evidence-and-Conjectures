To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we utilize Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach the problem:

Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( N \) be the event that the attack occurred in the specified neighborhood.

We are given:
- \( P(T|N^c) = 0.15 \), where \( N^c \) is the complement of the neighborhood (\( N^c \) refers to the city outside the specified neighborhood).
- \( P(T|N) = 0.20 \), the probability that someone in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(N) \), the probability that the attack happened in the neighborhood, but this is not directly provided.

To find the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability.

\[ P(T) = P(T|N) \cdot P(N) + P(T|N^c) \cdot P(N^c) \]

But since we are dealing only with the neighborhood, \( P(T|N) \) is already given from the neighborhood perspective:

\[ P(T|N) = 0.20 \]

Therefore, within the context of the neighborhood where the attack occurred, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ P(T|N) = 0.20 \]

So, the estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}
