Based on the information provided, the probability estimation needs to take into account the specific distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred:

- In the city, 85% are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the specific neighborhood, 80% are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, the relevant distribution to consider is that of the neighborhood:

- Probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller: 20% (or 0.20).

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller:

{probability: 0.20}
