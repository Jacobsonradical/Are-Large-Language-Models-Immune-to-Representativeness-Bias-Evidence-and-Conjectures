To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we use the information specific to the neighborhood in which the attack occurred. According to this information, in the neighborhood:

- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and
- 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack's location is in the neighborhood with these specific proportions, we ignore the city-wide data and focus on the neighborhood data.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
