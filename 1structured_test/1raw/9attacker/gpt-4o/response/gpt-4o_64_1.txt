To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the localized statistics in the neighborhood, we use the information provided about the neighborhood rather than city-wide data. 

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of people are 185 cm or taller

Since the attack took place in this particular neighborhood, it's reasonable to use the neighborhood's distribution to estimate the probability.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
