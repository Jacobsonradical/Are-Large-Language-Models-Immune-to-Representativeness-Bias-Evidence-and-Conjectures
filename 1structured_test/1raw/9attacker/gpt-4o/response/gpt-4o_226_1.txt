To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, rather than the city as a whole, since the specific location details give us more accurate information.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm (0.80 probability).
- In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller (0.20 probability).

Since the question specifically focuses on the neighborhood where the attack occurred, and there is no additional information to suggest any change in these probabilities due to the nature of the attack or other factors, we directly use these probabilities.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
