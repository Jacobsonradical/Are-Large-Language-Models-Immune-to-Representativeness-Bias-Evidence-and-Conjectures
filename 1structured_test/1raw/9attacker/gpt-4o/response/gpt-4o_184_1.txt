To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to account for both the neighborhood-specific information and the population distribution. However, the neighborhood-specific information is more relevant here since the event occurred there.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, the probabilities are:
- 80% (or 0.8) of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% (or 0.2) of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Given these probabilities, the estimate that the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be directly taken as the neighborhood-specific probability.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.2}
