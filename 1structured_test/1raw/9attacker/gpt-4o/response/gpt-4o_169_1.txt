The solution to this problem can be approached using Bayesian probability. The probability \( P(H|E) \) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the evidence provided (the neighborhood statistics), can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given the information from the neighborhood:
- \( P(H) = 0.2 \) (20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E|H) = 1 \) (the evidence is inherently fulfilled given the height of the attacker).
- \( P(E) = 1 \) (regardless of the attacker's height, the evidence must hold true).

Since the likelihood and the evidence probabilities are certain, Bayes' theorem simplifies to:

\[ P(H|E) = P(H) \]

Thus, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood statistics is:

{probability: 0.2}
