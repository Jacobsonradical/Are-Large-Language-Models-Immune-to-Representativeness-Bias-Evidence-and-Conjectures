To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the outline:

1. **Prior Probability (P(Height â‰¥ 185 | General City Population))**: This is the overall likelihood that any randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is \( P(185) = 0.15 \).

2. **Evidence (Prior Probability in the Neighborhood)**: The probability that a person selected from the specific neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, which is \( P(Neighborhood | 185) = 0.20 \).

3. **Base Rate (Prior Probability for People Shorter than 185 in the City)**: This is the likelihood that any person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is \( P(<185) = 0.85 \).

4. **Base Rate for Shorter People in the Neighborhood**: Probability that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm, which is \( P(Neighborhood | <185) = 0.80 \).

5. **Normalization Factor (Total Probability of the Neighborhood)**:
   \[
   P(Neighborhood) = P(185) \cdot P(Neighborhood | 185) + P(<185) \cdot P(Neighborhood | <185)
                   = (0.15 \times 0.20) + (0.85 \times 0.80)
                   = 0.03 + 0.68
                   = 0.71
   \]

Using Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(185 | Neighborhood) \):

\[
P(185 | Neighborhood) = \frac{P(Neighborhood | 185) \cdot P(185)}{P(Neighborhood)} = \frac{0.20 \times 0.15}{0.71} = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \approx 0.0423
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.0423. 

So the estimate is:

\{probability: 0.0423\}
