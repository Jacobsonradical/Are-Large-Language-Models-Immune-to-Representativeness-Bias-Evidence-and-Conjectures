To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from the neighborhood, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence available, which in this context means we consider the general stats for the neighborhood.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(H) \): the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood, which is 0.20 or 20%.
- \( P(E) \): the total probability of the evidence, considering both cases (whether the person is shorter than 185 cm or 185 cm or taller). This is adjusted by the city's percentage.
  
Let's calculate \( P(E) \).

- \( P(E) \) can be computed as: 
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
Where \( P(\neg H) \) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 80% or 0.80 in the neighborhood.

\( P(E | H) \) is 1 because it includes both tall and short people based on their innate possibility.

- \( P(E | \neg H) \) for people being shorter is 1 since it also includes all people naturally less than 185 cm.

Since both conditionals include all available categories, they do not deviate for the hypothesized specific:

- \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(H) \cdot 1 + P(\neg H) \cdot 1 = 0.20 \cdot 1 + 0.80 \cdot 1 = 0.20 + 0.80 = 1 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.20}{1} = 0.20 \]

So, the probability estimate based on neighborhood data is:

{probability: 0.20}
