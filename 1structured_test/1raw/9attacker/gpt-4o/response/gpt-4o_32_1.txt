Given the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This can be expressed using the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

We know:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- Therefore, 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Using this information, we can directly estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

{probability: 0.20}
