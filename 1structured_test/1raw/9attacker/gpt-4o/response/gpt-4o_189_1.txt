To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the specific context of the neighborhood, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood's height distribution.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in this specific neighborhood and we're asked about the attacker's height based on the neighborhood's distribution, we directly use these neighborhood-specific probabilities.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\( P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.20 \)

So the answer is:
- {probability: 0.20}
