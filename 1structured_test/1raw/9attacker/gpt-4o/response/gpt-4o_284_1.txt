To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood's demographics, we should use the neighborhood's data rather than the city's overall data because the attack occurred in that specific neighborhood.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.20.

Thus, the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
