To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood statistics, we can use the premise of conditional probability.

Given:
- In the city, 85% are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

We need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given no specific information about their height, just based on the neighborhood statistics.

The probability should thus be the same as the neighborhood statistics since we don't have any additional specific height information about the attacker. This means:

{probability: 0.2}
