To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of people are 185 cm or taller

As the victim could not see the attacker's height and we are only given the neighborhood statistics without any additional specific evidence about the attacker's height, the best estimate we can use is the proportion from the neighborhood.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
