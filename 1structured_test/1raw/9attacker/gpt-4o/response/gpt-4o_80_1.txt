Given the information, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the neighborhood statistics. 

Let's denote:

- \(H\) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(N\) as the event that the attacker is from the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Here are the provided probabilities:

- \(P(H|N) = 0.2\)
- \(P(\neg H|N) = 0.8\)

We are not given any additional specific information, such as witness statements or evidence that affects this probability, so we will use the neighborhood statistics directly.

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
