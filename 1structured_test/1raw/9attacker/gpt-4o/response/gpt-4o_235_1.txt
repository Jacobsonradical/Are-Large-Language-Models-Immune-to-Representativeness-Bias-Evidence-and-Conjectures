Given the attacker was in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we should use the neighborhood statistics rather than the city-wide statistics.

In the neighborhood:
- Probability a person is shorter than 185 cm (P(Short)): 80% or 0.80
- Probability a person is 185 cm or taller (P(Tall)): 20% or 0.20

Since no additional information about the attacker is available that would sway our estimate beyond the given neighborhood statistics, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller remains the proportion of individuals in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
