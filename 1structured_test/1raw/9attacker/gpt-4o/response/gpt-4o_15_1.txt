First, let's use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the context of the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the attacker is from the neighborhood.

We need to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are from the neighborhood.

Given data:
- \( P(A) \) is the proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 0.15.
- \( P(B | A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} \) is the proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood, given that they are 185 cm or taller in the city.
- \( P(B) \) is the proportion of people from the neighborhood, which is not directly given, but we know the proportion of different heights in the neighborhood.

We do not need \( P(B) \) directly here as it will get canceled out, but we do need \( P(A \cap B) \):
- The probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is from the neighborhood and 185 cm or taller is related to the probability of a person being in the neighborhood and 185 cm or taller.

Since no other specific data is provided, let's assume the neighborhood reflects the city proportion:
- \( P(B | A) \approx \frac{20\%}{15\%} = \frac{0.20}{0.15} = \frac{4}{3} \),
but it actually simplifies as \( P(B | A) = 1 \).

Finally, we simplify as:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \approx \frac{ P(A) }{ P(B) }\approx 20/100= \frac{0.20}{1}=1 \]

So:
\[ \text{{probability}} = 20/100 = 0.2 \]

Putting it in the required format:
\{probability: 0.2\}
