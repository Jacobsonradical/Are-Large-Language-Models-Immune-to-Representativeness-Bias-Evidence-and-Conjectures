The probability estimate that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Here's how it works in this case:

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the attack happened in the neighborhood.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

According to Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the attack happened in the neighborhood given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the attack happened in the neighborhood.

From the city statistics:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)

From the neighborhood statistics:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.80 \)

We need \( P(B) \), which can be found via the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.20 \cdot 0.15 + 0.80 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now we can find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

Therefore, the probability estimate that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.0423}
