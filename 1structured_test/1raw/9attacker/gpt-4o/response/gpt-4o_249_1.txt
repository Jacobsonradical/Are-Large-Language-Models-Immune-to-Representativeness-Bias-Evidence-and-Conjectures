To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the context of the attack occurring in a specific neighborhood, we use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 80% (0.80) of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% (0.20) of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Now, to find the desired probability, \( P(T \geq 185 | A) \), where \( A \) is the event that an attack occurred, we look at the distribution of heights in the neighborhood without additional information about the specific attacker. Thus, we assume the attacker is representative of the neighborhood population.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is equivalent to the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

So the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(T \geq 185 | A) = 0.20 \]

Therefore,

{probability: 0.20}
