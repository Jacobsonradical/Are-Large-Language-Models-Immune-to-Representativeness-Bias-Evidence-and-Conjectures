To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that we know the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with its own height distribution, we can use the information provided about that neighborhood. In this neighborhood, 80% of the residents are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since there are no additional specifics about the attack that would suggest one height group over another (e.g., no witness identified the height), the most straightforward approach is to use the height distribution data from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is directly based on the height distribution in this neighborhood.
