To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information about the neighborhood's population distribution, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the attacker comes from the neighborhood.

From the problem:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.20 (20%) according to the neighborhood data.
- \( P(A^c) \) is the prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.80 (80%) according to the neighborhood data.
- Since the attack happened at night and the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, the prior probabilities remain the same. Therefore, \( P(B|A) = 1 \)

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack happened in the neighborhood. Since we have no additional information specifically about the incident or the attacker, we use the proportion of heights in the neighborhood directly:

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) \]

So:
\[ P(A|B) = 0.20 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
