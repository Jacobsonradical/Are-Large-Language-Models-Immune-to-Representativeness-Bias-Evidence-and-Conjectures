To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attack occurred in the neighborhood where 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the specified neighborhood.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of the attack occurring in the neighborhood given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood.

From the problem we have:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.20 \) (20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B) \) needs to be calculated, which is the weighted sum of the probabilities of being in the neighborhood given the two height categories (shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From the data, we know:
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.80 \)

Now we can compute \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = 0.20 \cdot 0.15 + 0.80 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.0423}
