To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack took place. The relevant probabilities are:

- P(Shorter than 185 cm | Neighborhood) = 0.80
- P(185 cm or taller | Neighborhood) = 0.20

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, and we have no additional information about the attacker's height, we use the prior probabilities from the neighborhood distribution. Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
