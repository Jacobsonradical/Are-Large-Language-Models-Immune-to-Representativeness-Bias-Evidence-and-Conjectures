To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. According to the information given:

- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we have no additional information about the attacker other than their location, we can use these percentages directly to estimate the probability.

Therefore:

{probability: 0.20}
