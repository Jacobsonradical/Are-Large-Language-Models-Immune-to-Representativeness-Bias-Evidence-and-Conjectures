To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll utilize the information from the specific neighborhood since it provides more localized data relative to the general population.

Given:
- In the specific neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- Therefore, 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Since we don't have any direct information about the attacker other than the height distribution in the neighborhood, we can use the neighborhood probability as our estimate.

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).
