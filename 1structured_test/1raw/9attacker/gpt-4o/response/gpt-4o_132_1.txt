We have two pieces of information: the city-wide distribution of heights and the neighborhood-specific distribution of heights.

We are given:
- City-wide: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- Neighborhood: 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should focus on the neighborhood-specific distribution. Therefore, the relevant estimate would be:

Neighborhood-specific:
- Probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm: 0.80
- Probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller: 0.20

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
