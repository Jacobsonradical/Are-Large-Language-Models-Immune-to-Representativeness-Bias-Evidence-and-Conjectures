To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information about the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

In this particular neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, we should base our estimation on these percentages.

Hence, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 20%, which can be represented as 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
