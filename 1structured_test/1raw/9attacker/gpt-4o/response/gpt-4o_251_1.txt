To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we use the neighborhood-specific information since the attack occurred in that neighborhood.

We are given:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we lack any specific information other than the neighborhood statistics, we rely solely on these probabilities.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Hence, the probability is:

\[
\{probability: 0.20\}
\]

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.2}
