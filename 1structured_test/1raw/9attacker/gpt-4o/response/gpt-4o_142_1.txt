To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood statistics, we should use the given information within the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. The relevant information is:

- 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood and we have no other information to differentiate between individuals, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is directly given by the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height or taller.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
