To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the neighborhood statistics, we can use the concept of conditional probability. 

Given:
- In the city: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood: 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we will use the neighborhood statistics.

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood data is 20%, or 0.20.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
