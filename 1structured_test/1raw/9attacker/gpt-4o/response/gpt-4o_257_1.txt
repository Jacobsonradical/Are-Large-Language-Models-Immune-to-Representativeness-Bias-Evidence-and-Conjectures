To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the neighborhood proportions, we can use the information that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Using these numbers directly as probabilities, we have:
- Probability that a person from the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm (P(shorter)): 0.80
- Probability that a person from the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller (P(taller)): 0.20

Since the victim couldn’t see the attacker’s height, and we don’t have any additional complicating factors to consider, we can straightforwardly say that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

So, the probability is:

\[ \text{{probability: }} 0.20 \]

{probability: 0.20}
