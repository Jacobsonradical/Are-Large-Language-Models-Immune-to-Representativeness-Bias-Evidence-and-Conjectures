To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to take into account the specific information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Given that in the neighborhood:

- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller

We assume that the attacker's height distribution matches that of the neighborhood. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in that neighborhood.

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
