To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we can use the given neighborhood statistics.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
- The probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.80.
- The probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

Since the victim did not have any information about the attacker's height, we rely entirely on these neighborhood statistics to estimate the probability.

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
