To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, we can use this neighborhood-specific information.

Since the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, we will base our estimate on the distribution of heights within this neighborhood.

Given information:
- 80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in this neighborhood, is directly taken from this neighborhood's height distribution.

Therefore, the estimate is:
{probability: 0.2}
