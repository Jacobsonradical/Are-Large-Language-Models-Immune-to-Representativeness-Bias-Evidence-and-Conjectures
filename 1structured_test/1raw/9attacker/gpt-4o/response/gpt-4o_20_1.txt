We can utilize Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood's height distribution. 

Let's define:
- \( H \): Attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \): The attack occurred in the neighborhood with given height distribution.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H \mid N) = \frac{P(N \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(N)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(N \mid H) \) is the likelihood of the neighborhood given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(N) \) is the total probability of the neighborhood's height distribution.

Given:
- In the general city, \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- In the neighborhood, \( P(H \mid N) = 0.20 \)

These are the inputs for the Bayes' theorem. We can assume \( P(N \mid H) = 0.20 \) directly from \( P(H \mid N) \).

We need to compute \( P(N) \):
\[ P(N) = P(N \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(N \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
where \( \neg H \) is the complement event (height less than 185 cm).

From the data:
- \( P(N \mid H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(N \mid \neg H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \)

Now:
\[ P(N) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(N) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(N) = 0.71 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid N) = \frac{P(N \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(N)} \]
\[ P(H \mid N) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H \mid N) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H \mid N) \approx 0.042 \]

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.042}
