Given the information provided, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): "Attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- \( B \): "Attack occurred in the neighborhood"

We want to estimate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

From the problem statement:

- \( P(B) = 1 \) (the attack definitely occurred in the neighborhood)
- \( P(A|B) = 0.2 \) (20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the attack occurred in the neighborhood, is directly \( P(A|B) \).

Hence,

{probability: 0.2}
