Since the probability related to the specific neighborhood where the attack took place is more pertinent to this case, we should base our estimate on that data rather than the general population data for the city.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
- The probability that any randomly chosen individual is shorter than 185 cm is 80% (or 0.80).
- The probability that any randomly chosen individual is 185 cm or taller is 20% (or 0.20).

Given that the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, here is the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

{probability: 0.20}
