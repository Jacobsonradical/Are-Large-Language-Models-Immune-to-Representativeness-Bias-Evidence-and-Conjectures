To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the specific neighborhood proportions, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how you can do it step-by-step:

1. Define the events:
   - \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( B \): The attacker is from the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

2. Known probabilities:
   - \( P(A | B) = 0.20 \) (Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given they are from the neighborhood)
   - \( P(B) = 1 \), since we know for certain the attacker is from that neighborhood.

Bayesâ€™ theorem states:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this case:
- \( P(B | A) = 1 \) (Because we know the attacker is from the neighborhood, which means \( B \) is a given.)
- \( P(A) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(B) = 1 \)

Thus:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.20}{1} = 0.20 \]

This matches our initial \( P(A | B) \) without needing complex calculations since the required probability directly aligns with the given neighborhood proportions.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
