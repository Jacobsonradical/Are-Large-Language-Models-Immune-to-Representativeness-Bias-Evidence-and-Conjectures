Given that the information relevant to the case most likely pertains to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, the relevant statistics are that 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
