First, let's denote the following:
- \(A\) represents the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- \(B\) represents the event that an attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We are given:
- \(P(A) = 0.15\) (the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(A \mid B) = 0.20\) (the probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller).

We are looking to estimate \(P(A \mid B)\), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we get:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \(P(B)\), the overall probability that a person is from the neighborhood. If the city population and neighborhood population distribution are not proportionally different, we might directly use given probabilities. However, since \(P(B)\) is just the representation of neighborhood distribution, we know \(P(B) = 1\) in the given scenario due to neighborhood conditionality directly provided.

Given that neighborhood distribution for heights is provided straight:
\[P(A \mid B) = 0.20 \]

Therefore, we arrive at:
{probability: 0.20}
