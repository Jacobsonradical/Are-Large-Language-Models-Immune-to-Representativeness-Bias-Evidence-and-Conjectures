Given the problem setup, what we essentially need is the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood. We will use the information specific to the neighborhood, not the entire city.

Here, we are given that in the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller

To simplify directly, the probability that a random person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
