To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the events:**
   - Let \( T \) be the event that the person is taller than or equal to 185 cm.
   - Let \( N \) be the event that the person is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \( P(T) \): Probability that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood is taller than or equal to 185 cm.
   - \( P(N) \): Probability that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm.

   From the information provided:
   \[
   P(T) = 0.20 \quad \text{(20% of the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller)}
   \]
   \[
   P(N) = 0.80 \quad \text{(80% of the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm)}
   \]

3. **We seek \( P(T | \text{attack occurred}) \):** The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that an attack occurred.

We initially don't have any additional information about the attacker besides the neighborhood proportions. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the same as the neighborhood proportion.

Thus,
\[ {probability: 0.20} \]

So we have:
\[ {probability: 0.20} \]
