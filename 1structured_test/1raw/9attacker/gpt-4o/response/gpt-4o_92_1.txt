To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack happened in a neighborhood with a specific population distribution, we use the information about the neighborhood.

From the neighborhood distribution:
- 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is directly based on the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller:

{probability: 0.20}
