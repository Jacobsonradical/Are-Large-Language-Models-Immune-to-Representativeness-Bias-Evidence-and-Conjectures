To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller using the information provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \): The attack occurred in the neighborhood (versus elsewhere in the city).

We are asked to find \( P(A | N) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

The information given includes:
- \( P(A) \): The probability that a person in the general city population is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- \( P(N) \): The probability that a person is in the neighborhood = (not directly given, but typically 1 since we are focusing only on the neighborhood)
- \( P(A | N) \): The probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller = 0.20
- \( P(\neg A | N) \): The probability that a person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm = 0.80

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | N) = \frac{P(N | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(N)} \]

Given that we are focusing only on the neighborhood:

\[ P(N | A) = P(A | N) = 0.20 \]

Finally, substituting the values:

\[ P(A | N) = 0.20 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood is:

\[ \text{{probability}}: \{ 0.20\} \]
