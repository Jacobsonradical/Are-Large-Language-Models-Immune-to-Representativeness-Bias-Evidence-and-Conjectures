To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from the neighborhood, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that an individual from the neighborhood is the attacker.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(A) = 0.2 \)  (since 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.8 \) (since 80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm)

Since the probability of being attacked is assumed independent of height within the neighborhood, we don't need additional conditional probabilities. Therefore, the attacker's height distribution is simply assumed to follow the neighborhood's height distribution.

Thus,
\[ P(A \mid B) = P(A) \]
\[ = 0.2 \]

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is \( 0.2 \).
