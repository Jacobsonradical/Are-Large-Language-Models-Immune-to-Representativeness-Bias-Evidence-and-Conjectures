To estimate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that we know the neighborhood's height distribution, we use the information specific to the neighborhood rather than the city's overall distribution. 

The relevant data is:
- 80% of the neighborhood population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the neighborhood population is 185 cm or taller.

Since this is the probability distribution known for the specific location of the attack, we use this to estimate the likelihood of the attacker's height.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is directly given by the neighborhood statistics:

{probability: 0.20}
