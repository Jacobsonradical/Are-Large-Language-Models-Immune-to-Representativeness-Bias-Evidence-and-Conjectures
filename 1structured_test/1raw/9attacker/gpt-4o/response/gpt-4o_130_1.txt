Given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood where the height distributions are known.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \) be the event that the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood.

We want to find \( P(A|N) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are in the neighborhood.

The information given is:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (Probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller in the city)
- \( P(N|A) = 0.20 \) (Probability that a person 185 cm or taller is in the neighborhood)
- \( P(N|\neg A) = 0.80 \) (Probability that a person shorter than 185 cm is in the neighborhood)

First, find \( P(N) \), the overall probability that a person is in the neighborhood:

\[ P(N) = P(N|A) \cdot P(A) + P(N|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) \):

\[ P(N) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(N) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(N) = 0.71 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|N) = \frac{P(N|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(N)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(A|N) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]

Calculate the numerator:

\[ 0.20 \cdot 0.15 = 0.03 \]

Now calculate \( P(A|N) \):

\[ P(A|N) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \approx 0.0423 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{probability: 0.0423\} \]
