To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the neighborhood.

From the problem, we know:

- In the relevant neighborhood, the percentage of people shorter than 185 cm is 80%.
- In the relevant neighborhood, the percentage of people 185 cm or taller is 20%.

Given this information, and without any additional specific information about the attacker, we can assume that the attacker is representative of the neighborhood's population distribution.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.20}
