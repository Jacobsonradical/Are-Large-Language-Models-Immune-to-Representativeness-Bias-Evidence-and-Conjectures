To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, we need to use Bayesian reasoning.

Given Data:
- In the city, 85% are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the specific neighborhood, 80% are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.
  
Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should use the probabilities relevant to that neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (given that the attack happened in the neighborhood) is directly the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

\[ P(\text{taller than or equal to 185 cm}) = 0.20 \]

Thus,

{probability: 0.2}
