We can solve this problem by applying Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis, based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Based on the information provided:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15.
- \( P(A^c) \) is the complementary event that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, so \( P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \).
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability that a person 185 cm or taller is from the neighborhood, is 0.20.
- \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability that a person shorter than 185 cm is from the neighborhood, is 0.80.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are from the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

To find \( P(B) \), the total probability that a person is from the neighborhood, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(B) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now, substitute \( P(B) \) back into Bayes' Theorem equation:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{probability: 0.0423\} \]
