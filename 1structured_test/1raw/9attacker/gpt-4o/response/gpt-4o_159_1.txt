To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Given:
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- \( P(NH) \): Prior probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
- \( P(E|H) \): Probability of observing the evidence (living in the neighborhood) given that the person is 185 cm or taller = 0.20
- \( P(E|NH) \): Probability of observing the evidence (living in the neighborhood) given that the person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.80

We want to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that they live in the neighborhood.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|NH) \cdot P(NH) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.71 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.042 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
