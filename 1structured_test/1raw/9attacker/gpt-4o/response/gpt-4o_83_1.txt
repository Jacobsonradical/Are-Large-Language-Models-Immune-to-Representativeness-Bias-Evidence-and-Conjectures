To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the relevant population data from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

From the given data:

- 80% of the neighborhood population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the neighborhood population is 185 cm or taller.

When no further information about the attacker is available other than the neighborhood's demographic distribution, we use these probabilities directly.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is:

\[ \text{Probability} = 0.20 \]

So, in the required format:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.2} \} \]
