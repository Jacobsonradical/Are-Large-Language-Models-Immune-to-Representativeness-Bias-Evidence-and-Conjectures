To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information from the neighborhood where the attack occurred, rather than the general city population. 

According to the investigation, in the neighborhood, 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be directly taken from the neighborhood statistics.

{probability: 0.20}
