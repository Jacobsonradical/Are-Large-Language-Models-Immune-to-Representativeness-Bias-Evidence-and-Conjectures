To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we need to use the data specific to the neighborhood in which the attack occurred. According to the investigation:

- 80% of the neighborhood population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the neighborhood population is 185 cm or taller.

Since the attacker was from the neighborhood, we should use these neighborhood-specific probabilities.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is equal to the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller:

\[ \text{Probability} = 0.20 \]

So, the estimated probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
