To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack happened in a specific neighborhood, we need to use the information specific to that neighborhood.

According to the information provided:

- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
  - 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
  - 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, the relevant probabilities for our calculation are the ones specific to this neighborhood.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
