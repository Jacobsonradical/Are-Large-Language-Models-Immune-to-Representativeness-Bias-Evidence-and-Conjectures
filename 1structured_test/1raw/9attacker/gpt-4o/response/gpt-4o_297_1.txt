To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information on the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we can use the probabilities provided about the neighborhood.

In the neighborhood:

- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

Expressed as a decimal, this probability is \(0.20\).

So, the estimate of the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
