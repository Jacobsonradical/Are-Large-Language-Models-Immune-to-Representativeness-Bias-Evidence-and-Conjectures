To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, we will use the information specific to that neighborhood.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we don't have any other information about the attacker, we will use the neighborhood distribution directly. Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
