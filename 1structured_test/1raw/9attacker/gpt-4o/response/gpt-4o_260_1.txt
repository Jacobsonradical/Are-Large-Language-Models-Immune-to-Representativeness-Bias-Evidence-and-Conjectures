To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood information.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that a person is in the neighborhood given that they are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that a person is in the neighborhood.

To fill in these probabilities:
- Let's denote \( A \) as the event "a person is 185 cm or taller" and \( B \) as the event "a person is in the neighborhood".
- From the city data, \( P(A) = 0.15 \).
- From the neighborhood data, \( P(B|A) = 0.20 \).
- The probability that a person is in the neighborhood, \( P(B) \), can be computed by considering the combination of people who are shorter and taller in the neighborhood.

First, let's calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B \text{ | shorter than 185 cm}) \cdot P(\text{shorter than 185 cm}) + P(B \text{ | 185 cm or taller}) \cdot P(185 \text{ cm or taller}) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.85 + 0.2 \cdot 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.68 + 0.03 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
{probability: 0.0423}
