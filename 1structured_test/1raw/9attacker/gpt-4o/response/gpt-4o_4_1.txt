Given the data, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Since no other information is provided about the attacker, we can reasonably assume that the attacker has the same height distribution as the general population of the neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is equal to the fraction of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

Thus, the estimate of the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
