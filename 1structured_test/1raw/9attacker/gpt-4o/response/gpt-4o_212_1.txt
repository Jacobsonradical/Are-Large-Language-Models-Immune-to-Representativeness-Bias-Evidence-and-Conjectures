To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller, we can use the information specific to that neighborhood.

In this neighborhood:
- The proportion of people shorter than 185 cm is 80%, or 0.80.
- The proportion of people 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.20.

Given this neighborhood-specific information, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is directly taken from this proportion.

Thus, we have:
{probability: 0.20}
