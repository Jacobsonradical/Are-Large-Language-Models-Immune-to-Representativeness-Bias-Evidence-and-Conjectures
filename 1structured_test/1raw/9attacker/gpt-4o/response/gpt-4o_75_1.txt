To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

According to the police investigation, in the neighborhood:

- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm (0.80 probability)
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller (0.20 probability)

Since we have no other information about the attacker other than the height distribution in the neighborhood, we will directly use these probabilities.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
