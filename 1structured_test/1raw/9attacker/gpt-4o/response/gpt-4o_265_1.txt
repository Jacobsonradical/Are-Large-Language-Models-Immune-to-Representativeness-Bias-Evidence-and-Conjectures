Given the information, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, considering the neighborhood-specific data where the attack occurred.

Let's denote:
- \( H \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the neighborhood data:
- \( P(H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(N) = 0.80 \)

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood and we don't have any additional information about the attacker that would influence the probability calculation, we rely on the neighborhood-specific data.

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
