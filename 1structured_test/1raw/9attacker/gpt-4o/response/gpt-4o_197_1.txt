To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the specific scenario in the neighborhood, we need to use the proportions relevant to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. According to the information provided:

- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, we should use these neighborhood-specific proportions rather than the overall city proportions. Given this:

{probability: 0.2}

This estimate suggests that there is a 20% chance (or a probability of 0.2) that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
