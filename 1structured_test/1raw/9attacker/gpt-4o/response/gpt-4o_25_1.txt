To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, we should use the information specific to the neighborhood rather than the entire city population.

In the neighborhood where the attack took place:
- Probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.80 (80%)
- Probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller = 0.20 (20%)

Since we lack any additional specific information about the attacker and only have the population distribution data of the neighborhood, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the overall probability for someone in that neighborhood to be 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
