Given the information provided, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the neighborhood:

- 80% are shorter than 185 cm
- 20% are 185 cm or taller

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood's height distribution to estimate the probability.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
