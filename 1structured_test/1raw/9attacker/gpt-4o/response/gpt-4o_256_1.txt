To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information, we should utilize the specific data relevant to the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the neighborhood, the distribution of heights is:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack took place in this neighborhood, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller relies on these proportions.

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
