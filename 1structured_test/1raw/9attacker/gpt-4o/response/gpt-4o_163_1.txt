To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the height distribution in the neighborhood, we use the neighborhood data directly because that's the most pertinent information for this specific event. 

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
