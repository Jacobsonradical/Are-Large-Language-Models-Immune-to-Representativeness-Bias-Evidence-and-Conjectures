To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use the information given about the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, as it is more relevant to the specific situation.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% are 185 cm or taller.

This directly translates to the probability that a randomly chosen individual from that neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is \(0.20\).
