Given the information, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood's population distribution.

Here's the known information:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we are interested in the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given this information, the solution is straightforward as we just take the proportion of the population in that height category.

So, the estimate of the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
