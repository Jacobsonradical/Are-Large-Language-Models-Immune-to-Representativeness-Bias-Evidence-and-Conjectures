To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information about the neighborhood's population, you can directly use the neighborhood data since the attack happened there.

In the neighborhood:

- 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
