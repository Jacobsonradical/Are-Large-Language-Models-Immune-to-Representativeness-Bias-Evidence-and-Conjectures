Given the information:

- In the general city population, the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller is \(0.15\) (15%).
- In the neighborhood where the attack happened, the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller is \(0.20\) (20%).

Since the relevant context is the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we use that specific probability for our estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\{probability: 0.20\}
