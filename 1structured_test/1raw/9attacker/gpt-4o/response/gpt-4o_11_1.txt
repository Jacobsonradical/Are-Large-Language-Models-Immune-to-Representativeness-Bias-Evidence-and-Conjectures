First, we need to know that we are dealing with conditional probabilities. Given that the crime occurred in a neighborhood where 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller, we will base our probability estimation on this local data.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the neighborhood data, we know:
- \( P(A) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.80 \)

Since there is no additional information to distinguish between being taller or shorter than 185 cm from the attack report (the victim couldn't see the attacker's height), we assume that an individual being the attacker is independent of their height.

This means the attacker's height probability should just follow the distribution of heights in the neighborhood.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is:
\[ P(A) = 0.20 \]

So the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
