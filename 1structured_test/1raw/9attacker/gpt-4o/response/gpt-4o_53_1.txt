To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the neighborhood distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let \( A \) be the event that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller (20% or 0.20 chance), and \( B \) be the event that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15 chance).

We are looking for \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood distribution:

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Here:
- \( P(B \mid A) \) is the probability that a person is in the city, given they are 185 cm or taller. For simplicity in this context, this value is essentially 1 because the event of being 185 cm or taller does not depend on being in the city versus being in the neighborhood, given the overall population distributions we're working with.
- \( P(A) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \)

Plugging in these values:

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.20}{0.15} = \frac{0.20}{0.15} \approx 1.33
\]

This would imply a probability greater than 1, which indicates a miscalculation in how we're framing the problem since probabilities must be between 0 and 1. Reassessing, we realize that the conditional setup requires careful consideration of context.

Using the given data purely from the local neighborhood where the attack occurred:

Given the information provided solely within the neighborhood context:

\( \text{Probability} = 0.20 \)

So, directly:

\({probability: 0.20}\)
