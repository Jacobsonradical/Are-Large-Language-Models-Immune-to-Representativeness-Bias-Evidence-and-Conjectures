To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.80 \) (probability that a person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.20 \) (probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller)

Given no other information (since the victim could not see the attacker's height), the only relevant probabilities are those directly given by the neighborhood distribution. Hence, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is exactly the same as the original distribution in the neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
