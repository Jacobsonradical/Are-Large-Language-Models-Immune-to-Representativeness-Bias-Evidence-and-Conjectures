To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the local neighborhood statistics rather than the city-wide statistics, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood. Here's the relevant data for the neighborhood:

- 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Given this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
