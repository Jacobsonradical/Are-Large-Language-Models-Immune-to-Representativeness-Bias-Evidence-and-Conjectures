We start with the information that the attack occurred in the neighborhood with the specific height distribution. 

In this neighborhood:
- The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm is 80% (i.e., 0.8).
- The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller is 20% (i.e., 0.2).

Given that we have no additional information about the attacker’s height and need to estimate the probability based solely on the neighborhood’s height distribution, we use these probabilities directly.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
