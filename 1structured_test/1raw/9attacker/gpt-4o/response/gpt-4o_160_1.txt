To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information about the neighborhood specifically, as it provides a more direct context for the incident.

From the question, we know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
- 80% of the residents are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the residents are 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This can be directly taken from the neighborhood statistics.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
