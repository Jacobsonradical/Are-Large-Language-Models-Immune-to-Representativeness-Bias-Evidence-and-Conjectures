Given the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Let's denote the following:

- \( A \) is the event that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that a person is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:

- \( P(A) = 0.20 \) (20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.80 \) (80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm)

Additionally, we know 15% (or 0.15) of the city's population are 185 cm or taller. However, since the attacker's height did not provide information limiting it to the broader city context and the problem specifically focuses on the neighborhood context, we should use the given neighborhood probabilities.

Since we lack information that directly relates to any specific conditional probability upon victim information, we are only estimating based on the general neighborhood distribution.

Therefore, the probability \( P(A) \), that a randomly chosen person (attacker) from the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, stays as:

{probability: 0.20}
