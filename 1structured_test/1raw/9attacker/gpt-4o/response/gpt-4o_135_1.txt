To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the attack occurred in the neighborhood where the height distribution is different (80% shorter than 185 cm, 20% 185 cm or taller).

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.20 \) (the probability that a person 185 cm or taller is in the neighborhood).
- \( P(B|A') = 0.80 \) (the probability that a person shorter than 185 cm is in the neighborhood).

We need to find \( P(A|B) \).

First, let's calculate \( P(B) \), the overall probability that a person is in the neighborhood.

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
where \( P(A') \) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is \( 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \).

So:
\[ P(B) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{3}{71} \Rightarrow \approx 0.0423 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0423}
