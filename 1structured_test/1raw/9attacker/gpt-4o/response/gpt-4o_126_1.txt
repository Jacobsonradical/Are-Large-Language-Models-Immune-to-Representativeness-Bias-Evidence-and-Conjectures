To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, we will use the information specific to that neighborhood.

According to the data for the neighborhood:

- The probability that a randomly selected person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm is 80% or 0.8.
- The probability that a randomly selected person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20% or 0.2.

Since we don't have any additional information about the attacker's height beyond the fact that the attack occurred in this neighborhood, we use the neighborhood's distribution directly.

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%.
