To solve this, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let \( B \) be the event that the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (in the city population), which is 0.15.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the conditional probability of being in the neighborhood given that a person is 185 cm or taller. Given that 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, this value is 0.20.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood.

To find \( P(B) \), we sum the probabilities of being in the neighborhood given the person is either shorter than 185 cm or 185 cm or taller, weighted by the respective prior probabilities:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
where \( A' \) is the event of being shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(A') = 0.85 \)
- \( P(B|A') \) is the conditional probability of being in the neighborhood given that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is \( 0.80 \).

So, we calculate \( P(B) \) as:
\[ P(B) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 = 0.71 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.0423}\} \]
