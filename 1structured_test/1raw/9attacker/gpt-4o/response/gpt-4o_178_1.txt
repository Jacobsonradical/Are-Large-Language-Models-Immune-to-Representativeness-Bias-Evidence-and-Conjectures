To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given data, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let:
- \( H_1 \) = The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) = The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( D \) = The event that an attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(H_1) \) = The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood = 0.20
- \( P(H_2) \) = The prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm in the neighborhood = 0.80
- \( P(D | H_1) \) = The probability of an attack occurring given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 1 (since this is an observed event).
- \( P(D | H_2) \) = The probability of an attack occurring given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 1 (similarly, this is an observed event).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we find the posterior probability \( P(H_1 | D) \):

\[ P(H_1 | D) = \frac{P(D | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(D)} \]

\( P(D) \) is the total probability of an attack occurring, which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(D) = P(D | H_1) P(H_1) + P(D | H_2) P(H_2) \]
\[ P(D) = (1 \times 0.20) + (1 \times 0.80) = 0.20 + 0.80 = 1 \]

Given that \( P(D) = 1 \), we can simplify Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | D) = \frac{P(D | H_1) P(H_1)}{1} = P(H_1) = 0.20 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be:

{probability: 0.20}
