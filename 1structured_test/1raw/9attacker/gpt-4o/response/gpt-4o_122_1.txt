Given the information, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, considering the neighborhood-specific height distribution.

Let:
- \( H \ge 185 \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H < 185 \) be the event that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm.

We are given:
- In the neighborhood, \( P(H < 185) = 0.80 \) and \( P(H \ge 185) = 0.20 \).

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height and there are no other specific clues about the attacker, we only have the neighborhood height distribution to base our estimate on.

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, 
{probability: 0.20}
