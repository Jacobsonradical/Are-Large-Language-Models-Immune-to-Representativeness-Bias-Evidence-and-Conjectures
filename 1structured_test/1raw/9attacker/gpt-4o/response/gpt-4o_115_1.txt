To estimate the probability given the information, we will apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T|N) \): Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given in the neighborhood = 0.20
- \( P(S|N) \): Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given in the neighborhood = 0.80

We need to calculate \( P(T|A) \), where \( A \) is the event of the attack happening.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T|A) = \frac{P(A|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(A|T) \cdot P(T) + P(A|S) \cdot P(S)} \]

Assuming that the probability of an attack given the height is the same within the neighborhood (i.e., \( P(A|T) \approx P(A|S) \) since there is no additional distinguishing information in this context), the term simplifies:

\[ P(T|A) \approx P(T) \]

Given the investigation in the neighborhood:
- \( P(T) = 0.20 \) (since 20% are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.80 \) (since 80% are shorter than 185 cm)

So the estimate essentially boils down to the proportion of tall people in the neighborhood:

{probability: 0.20}
