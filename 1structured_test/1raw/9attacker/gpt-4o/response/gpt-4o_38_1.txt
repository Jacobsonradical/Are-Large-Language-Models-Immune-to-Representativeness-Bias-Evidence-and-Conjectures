To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood statistics, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution data since the event occurred in that specific neighborhood.

In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller. Since the attack took place in this neighborhood, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who meet this height criterion.

Therefore, the estimated probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
