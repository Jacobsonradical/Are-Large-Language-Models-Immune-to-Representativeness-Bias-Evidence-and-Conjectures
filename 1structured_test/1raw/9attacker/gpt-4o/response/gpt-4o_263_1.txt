Based on the information given about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is directly related to the distribution of heights in that specific neighborhood.

Given:
- 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Since we are focusing on the neighborhood statistics where the attack took place, we can use these probabilities to estimate the attacker's height without any further information or evidence provided.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
