To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll need to use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides a more localized context.

According to the data provided:

- In the neighborhood, 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood and we have no other information about the attacker other than the neighborhood statistics, the best estimate we can provide is based on the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in that neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}

This translates to a 20% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
