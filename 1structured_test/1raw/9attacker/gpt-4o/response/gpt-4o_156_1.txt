To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, we need to use the information about the neighborhood where the event took place. 

In the neighborhood, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 80% are shorter than 185 cm.

Since the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, we are interested in the local probability for this characteristic.

Thus, the estimate should purely come from the neighborhood demographics.
