Given the context of the attack and the neighborhood-specific statistics, we need to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the distribution of heights in that specific neighborhood.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

The probability estimate will be based solely on these neighborhood statistics because the city-wide statistics are not necessarily relevant to this specific neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is directly given by the proportion of such people in the neighborhood.

{probability: 0.2}
