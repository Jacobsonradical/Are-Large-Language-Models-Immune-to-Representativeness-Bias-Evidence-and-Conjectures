To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood with specific height distributions, we can use the information from the neighborhood rather than the entire city. 

In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller. Since the investigation focused on this neighborhood, the relevant probability to consider is the height distribution in that specific area.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.
