To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, we need to use the information specific to that neighborhood.

According to the neighborhood data:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Without any other specific information about the attacker, the best estimate of the attacker's height would be based directly on these probabilities.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
