To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use the information about the neighborhood in which the attack occurred since it is more specific and relevant to the situation.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since this is the relevant demographic information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
