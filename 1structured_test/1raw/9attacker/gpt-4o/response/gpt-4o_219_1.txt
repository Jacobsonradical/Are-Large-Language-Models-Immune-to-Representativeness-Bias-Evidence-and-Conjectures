To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller, we can use the information specific to the neighborhood rather than the general city data.

Since the question is focused on the neighborhood statistics:

- The probability that a randomly selected person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm is 0.80.
- The probability that a randomly selected person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

Since we don't have any additional information about the attacker's height beyond the neighborhood statistics, our best estimate will be based on these probabilities.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
