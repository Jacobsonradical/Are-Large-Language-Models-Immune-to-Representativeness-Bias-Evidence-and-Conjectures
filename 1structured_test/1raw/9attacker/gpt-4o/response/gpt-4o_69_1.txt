To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we use the neighborhood-specific information since the attack occurred there. According to the neighborhood data, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
