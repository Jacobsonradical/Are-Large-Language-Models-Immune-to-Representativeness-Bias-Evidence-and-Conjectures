We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood data.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We know from the neighborhood data:
- \( P(B) = 0.8 \) (80% are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(A) = 0.2 \) (20% are 185 cm or taller)

Given that the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, we are asking for the probability \( P(A) \).

Since no additional evidence modifies the prior probabilities given by the neighborhood data, we conclude:

\[ P(A) = 0.2 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

**{probability: 0.2}**
