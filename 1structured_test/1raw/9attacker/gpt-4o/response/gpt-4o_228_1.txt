To estimate the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller, we need to utilize the relevant neighborhood population percentages provided by the police, as this data is more localized to the situation.

From the information given:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Given that the attack occurred in this neighborhood, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is directly given by this localized data.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
