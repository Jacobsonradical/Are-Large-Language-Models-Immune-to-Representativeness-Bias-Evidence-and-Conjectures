To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, we need to use the information specific to that neighborhood rather than the general city population.

Here is how we can approach the problem:

1. **Neighborhood Population Proportion**:
   - 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
   - 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

This means that the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood is 0.20.

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because we are given no additional specific information about the attacker that would differentiate them from the general neighborhood distribution.
