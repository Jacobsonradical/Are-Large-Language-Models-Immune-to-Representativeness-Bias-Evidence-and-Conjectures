To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. According to the data, in this neighborhood:

- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Given this specific neighborhood data and no other information about the attacker, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is directly taken from this distribution.

Therefore, the estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}
