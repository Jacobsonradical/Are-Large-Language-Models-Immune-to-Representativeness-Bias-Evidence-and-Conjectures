To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the specific statistics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we'll use the information provided by the police investigation rather than the general city statistics. 

The neighborhood data shows the following:

- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we are specifically interested in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we will use these neighborhood-specific probabilities.

Given the attack happened in the neighborhood, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
