Given the probabilities provided, we want to estimate the likelihood that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, considering the specific neighborhood distribution.

Here are the details:
- City: \( P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.15 \), \( P(\text{Height} < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.85 \)
- Neighborhood: \( P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.20 \), \( P(\text{Height} < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.80 \)

Given the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should base our estimation primarily on the neighborhood-specific probabilities.

Therefore,
\[ P(\text{Attacker's height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.20 \]

So, the estimate is:
{probability: 0.20}
