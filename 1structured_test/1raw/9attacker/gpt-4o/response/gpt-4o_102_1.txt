The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood statistics can be calculated using Bayes' Theorem. Here, we need to find the posterior probability given the prior probabilities.

Let:
- \( P(A) \) = probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood = 0.20
- \( P(B) \) = probability that a person shorter than 185 cm in the neighborhood = 0.80

Since the victim could not see the height of the attacker, we don't have any additional information to revise our initial probabilities.

We are interested in the probability \( P(A) \), which is already given by the neighborhood statistics.

Therefore:
{probability: 0.20}
