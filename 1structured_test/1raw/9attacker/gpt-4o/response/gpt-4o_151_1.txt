To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood data, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Given probabilities in the neighborhood:**
   - \( P(A) = 0.20 \) (20% are 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(B) = 0.80 \) (80% are shorter than 185 cm)

3. **Calculate the total probability:**
   Since the victim could not see the attacker's height and we have no additional discriminating evidence (e.g., the probability of being attacked depending on the height isn't given), the total probability \( P(E) \) will be a simple calculation based on the given neighborhood distribution of heights.

   - \( P(E) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.20 + 0.80 = 1 \)

Given this setup, the problem essentially asks for the prior probability distribution from the neighborhood data. Since we have no additional evidence favoring one height group over the other, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of such individuals in the neighborhood population.

Therefore, the probability estimate is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.20} \} \]
