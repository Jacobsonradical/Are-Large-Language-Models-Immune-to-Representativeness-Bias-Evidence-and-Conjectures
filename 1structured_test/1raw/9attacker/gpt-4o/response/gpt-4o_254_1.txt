Weâ€™re given the following information:

- In the general population:
  - Probability someone is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(Short) = 0.85 \)
  - Probability someone is 185 cm or taller: \( P(Tall) = 0.15 \)
  
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
  - Probability someone is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(Short|Neighborhood) = 0.80 \)
  - Probability someone is 185 cm or taller: \( P(Tall|Neighborhood) = 0.20 \)

Using Bayesian inference, we're interested in the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that we're in the specific neighborhood. This is represented as \( P(Tall|Attack\ in\ Neighborhood) \).

Since we do not have any additional data favoring more specific attacker profiles within people in the neighborhood, we assume the attacker's height distribution matches the general distribution for the neighborhood.

Thus, the probability we are estimating is simply the proportion of tall individuals in the specified neighborhood.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ P(Tall|Attack\ in\ Neighborhood) = 0.20 \]

Hence:
