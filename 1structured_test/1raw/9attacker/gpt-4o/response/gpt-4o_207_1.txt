To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use the relevant information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more context-specific data.

In the neighborhood:
- The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm is 80% or 0.8.
- The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller is 20% or 0.2.

Since we are focused on the specific neighborhood where the attack took place, the relevant probability should be based on this data. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
