To solve this problem, we'll apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence. The evidence we have is that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where a certain distribution of heights is known.

According to Bayes' theorem, we want to find \( P(T | N) \), where:
- \( T \) denotes that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \) denotes the neighborhood, which has a specific height distribution.

Bayes' theorem formula is:

\[ P(T | N) = \frac{P(N | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(N)} \]

Where:
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(N) \) is the probability that a person is from the neighborhood.
- \( P(N | T) \) is the probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(T^c) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- In the neighborhood: \( P(N | T) = 0.20 \) and \( P(N | T^c) = 0.80 \).

We'll use the law of total probability to find \( P(N) \):

\[ P(N) = P(N | T) \cdot P(T) + P(N | T^c) \cdot P(T^c) \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(N) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(N) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(N) = 0.71 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(T | N) \):

\[ P(T | N) = \frac{P(N | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(N)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(T | N) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(T | N) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(T | N) \approx 0.0423 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.0423.
