Given the information:

- In the city: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred: 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood data, since the attack occurred in that specific neighborhood. The more relevant data for this case is from the neighborhood rather than the entire city.

Based on the neighborhood statistics, the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.

Thus:
{probability: 0.2}
