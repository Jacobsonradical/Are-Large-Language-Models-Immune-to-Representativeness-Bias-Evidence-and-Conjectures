To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to update our prior beliefs about the population based on the information specific to the neighborhood.

Let's define the events:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is from the general city population.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is from the neighborhood where the attack happened.
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, i.e., \( P(A | H_2) \).

From the problem:
- \( P(A | H_1) \): Probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15.
- \( P(A | H_2) \): Probability that a randomly chosen person from the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller = 0.20.

Since we are specifically interested in the neighborhood, we use the information specific to that context:
\[ P(A | H_2) = 0.20 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, is:

\{probability: 0.20\}
