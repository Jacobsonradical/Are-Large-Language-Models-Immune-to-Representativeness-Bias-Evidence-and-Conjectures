To solve this problem, we apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem formula is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood's height distribution.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the neighborhood's height distribution given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the neighborhood's height distribution.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (city-wide probability of being 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (city-wide probability of being shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B|A) = P(\text{neighborhood distribution}| \text{185 cm or taller}) = 0.20 \).
- \( P(B|A^c) = P(\text{neighborhood distribution}| \text{shorter than 185 cm}) = 0.80 \).

We need \( P(B) \), the total probability of the neighborhood's height distribution. We calculate it as follows:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the neighborhood's height distribution, is approximately 0.0423.
