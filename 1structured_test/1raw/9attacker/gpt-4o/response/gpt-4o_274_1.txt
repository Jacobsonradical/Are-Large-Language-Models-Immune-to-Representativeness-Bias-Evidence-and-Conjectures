To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs with new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) as the evidence from the neighborhood.

From the problem statement, we have:
- Prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller (from the general city population): \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- Probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (probability of being in the neighborhood given the person is 185 cm or taller): \( P(E | H) = 0.20 \).
- Probability of the evidence (probability of being in the neighborhood): \( P(E) \).

We can find \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H)P(H) + P(E | H^c)P(H^c) \]
where \( H^c \) is the hypothesis that the person is shorter than 185 cm:
\[ P(H^c) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \]

And the probability of evidence given \( H^c \):
\[ P(E | H^c) = 0.80 \]

Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ P(E) = (0.20 \times 0.15) + (0.80 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.71 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Plugging in the values we have:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H | E) \approx 0.0423 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0423}
