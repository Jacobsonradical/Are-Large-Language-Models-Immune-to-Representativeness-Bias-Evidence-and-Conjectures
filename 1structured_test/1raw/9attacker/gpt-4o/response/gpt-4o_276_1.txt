To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which can help us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller, is 0.15.
- \( P(A') \), the prior probability of a random person in the city being shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85.
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability of the person being in the specific neighborhood given that they are 185 cm or taller, is 0.20 (since 20% of the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A') \), the probability of the person being in the specific neighborhood given that they are shorter than 185 cm, is 0.80 (since 80% of the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood. This is found by considering both possibilities (the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.0423.
