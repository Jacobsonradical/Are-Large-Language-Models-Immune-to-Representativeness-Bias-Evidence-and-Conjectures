To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. In this neighborhood, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is simply the given proportion of taller individuals in that neighborhood.

{probability: 0.20}
