Let's use Bayesian reasoning to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is from the neighborhood.

We want to find \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (probability that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B \mid A) = 0.20 \) (probability of being in the neighborhood given the person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B \mid A') = 0.80 \) (probability of being in the neighborhood given the person is shorter than 185 cm, where \( A' \) is the event that a person is shorter than 185 cm).

We use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of being in the neighborhood. We can find this using the law of total probability:

\[
P(B) = P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \mid A') \cdot P(A')
\]

Given:
- \( P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \)

So:

\[
P(B) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68
\]

\[
P(B) = 0.71
\]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71}
\]

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71}
\]

\[
P(A \mid B) \approx 0.042
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.042}
