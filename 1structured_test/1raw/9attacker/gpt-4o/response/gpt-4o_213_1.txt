To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian reasoning. Define:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_1) \): Prior probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(H_2) \): Prior probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- City-wide: \( P(H_1)_{city} = 0.85 \), \( P(H_2)_{city} = 0.15 \)
- Neighborhood: \( P(H_1)_{neigh} = 0.80 \), \( P(H_2)_{neigh} = 0.20 \)

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood probabilities. Therefore:

\[ P(H_1) = P(H_1)_{neigh} = 0.80 \]
\[ P(H_2) = P(H_2)_{neigh} = 0.20 \]

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we don't have direct evidence altering these probabilities, thus relying on the neighborhood distribution.

Therefore, the probability estimate that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the same as the neighborhood percentage for that height:

\[ \{probability: 0.20\} \]

So, the answer is:

\[ \{probability: 0.20\} \]
