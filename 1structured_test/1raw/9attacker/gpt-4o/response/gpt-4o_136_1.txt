To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to take into account the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This is a straightforward application of Bayesian probability.

Given:

- In the neighborhood, the proportion of people shorter than 185 cm is 80% (0.80).
- In the neighborhood, the proportion of people 185 cm or taller is 20% (0.20).

Since we have no additional specific information about the attacker, we will use the neighborhood proportions directly.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, considering the neighborhood data, is:

{probability: 0.20}
