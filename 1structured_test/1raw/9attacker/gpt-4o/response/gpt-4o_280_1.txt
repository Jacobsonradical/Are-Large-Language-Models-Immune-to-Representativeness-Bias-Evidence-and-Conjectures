To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that we are specifically interested in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we need to consider the information provided about that neighborhood.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Given that we have no other specific information about the attacker and we know the attack took place in this neighborhood, the best estimate we have is based on the known proportions of height within this neighborhood.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is directly given by the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height.

{probability: 0.20}

This assumes no other information is provided that might change the estimation.
