To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more relevant data for the context of the incident.

According to the neighborhood data:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
