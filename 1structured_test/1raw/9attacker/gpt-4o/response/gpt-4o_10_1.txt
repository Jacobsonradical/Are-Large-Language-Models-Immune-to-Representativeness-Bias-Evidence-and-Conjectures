To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, you can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

We are given that:
- \( P(A \mid B) = 0.20 \) (20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A \mid B) = 0.80 \) (80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm)

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no additional evidence that would change our prior probability based on the neighborhood's population distribution.

Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the neighborhood distribution, remains the given prior probability:

{probability: 0.20}
