To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we will use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Given these proportions, and since we do not have additional specific information about the attacker, we will use the neighborhood's distribution as our best estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}

This estimate is based on the available neighborhood population data.
