To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can utilize Bayes' theorem. 

Let:
- \( A \) = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) = Event that an attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of an attack occurring in the neighborhood.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of an attack occurring in the neighborhood given that the person is 185 cm or taller.

Given data:
- \( P(B|A) = 1 \) (An attack occurred in the neighborhood, so this probability is 1 as it is a fact that the attack occurred in the neighborhood)
- \( P(A) = 0.20 \) (20% of neighborhood population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 1 \) (An attack occurred in the neighborhood, so the probability of this event is 1)

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.20}{1} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.20 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in that neighborhood, is:
{probability: 0.20}
