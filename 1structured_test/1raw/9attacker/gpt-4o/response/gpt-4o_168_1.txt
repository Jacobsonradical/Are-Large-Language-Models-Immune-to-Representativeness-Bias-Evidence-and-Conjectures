To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- \( P(A) \): Probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- \( P(B) \): Probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller = 0.20
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability that a person 185 cm or taller lives in the neighborhood

In this case, we are trying to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the neighborhood where the attack happened has a higher percentage of taller people.

Since we donâ€™t have direct priors for conditional probabilities, but we know about the population distribution in the neighborhood, we can focus on that data for a better estimate.

Given:
- \( P(A) \) within the neighborhood: The probability that any person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller = 0.20

Thus, the estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}

So, based on the provided information, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
