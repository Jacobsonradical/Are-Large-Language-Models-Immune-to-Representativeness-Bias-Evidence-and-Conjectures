Given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we will base our estimate on this specific neighborhood population distribution rather than the overall city statistics. 

Since the victim couldn't determine the attacker's height, the best estimate we have is the probability distribution of heights in the neighborhood.

{probability: 0.20}
