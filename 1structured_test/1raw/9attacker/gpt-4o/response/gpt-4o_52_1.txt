To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we need to use the data specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since no additional evidence distinguishes the attacker's height, we use the neighborhood's distribution directly as the best estimate. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
