To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and \( E \) be the event that the attack occurred in the neighborhood where the probability distribution of heights is known.

The problem provides us with the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \): The overall probability in the city that a person is 185 cm or taller is 15% (or 0.15).
2. \( P(H^c) \): The probability in the city that a person is shorter than 185 cm is 85% (or 0.85).
3. \( P(E | H) \): The probability that a person is in the neighborhood given they are 185 cm or taller is 20% (or 0.20).
4. \( P(E | H^c) \): The probability that a person is in the neighborhood given they are shorter than 185 cm is 80% (or 0.80).

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to find \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.20 \cdot 0.15 + 0.80 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.71 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H | E) \):

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H | E) \approx 0.0423 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.0423}
