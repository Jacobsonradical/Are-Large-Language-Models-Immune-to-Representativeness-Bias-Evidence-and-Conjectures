To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, we will use the information about the neighborhood rather than the general city population.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the relevant information for the estimate comes from the neighborhood, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, which is 0.20 in probability terms.

Therefore, the estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}
