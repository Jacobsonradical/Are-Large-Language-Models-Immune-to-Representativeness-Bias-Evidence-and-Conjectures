To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the characteristics of the neighborhood, we apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attack happened in the neighborhood where 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack happened in this specific neighborhood.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that any randomly selected individual in the general population is 185 cm or taller: \( P(A) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(A') \) is the prior probability that any randomly selected individual in the general population is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(A') = 0.85 \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that a person is from the neighborhood given that they are 185 cm or taller: \( P(B|A) = 0.20 \).
- \( P(B|A') \) is the probability that a person is from the neighborhood given that they are shorter than 185 cm: \( P(B|A') = 0.80 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

To find \( P(B) \), the total probability of someone being from the neighborhood, we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.20 \times 0.15) + (0.80 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 = 0.71 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \approx 0.0422 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.0422}
