To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, let's use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \) be the event that the attacker is from the neighborhood.

We are interested in \( P(H | N) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- \( P(H) = \text{0.15} \) (the prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(N | H) = \text{0.20} \) (the probability that a person in the city who is 185 cm or taller is from the neighborhood)
- \( P(N) = \text{unknown} \) (the total probability of a person being from the neighborhood, needs to be calculated)

To calculate \( P(N) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(N) = P(N | H) \cdot P(H) + P(N | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]

Where \( H^c \) represents the complement of \( H \), meaning the person is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(N | H^c) = 0.80 \) (the probability that a person in the city who is shorter than 185 cm is from the neighborhood)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, calculate \( P(N) \):
\[ P(N) = 0.20 \cdot 0.15 + 0.80 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(N) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(N) = 0.71 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H | N) \):
\[ P(H | N) = \frac{P(N | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(N)} \]
\[ P(H | N) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H | N) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H | N) \approx 0.0423 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.0423.

Therefore, the final answer is:

{probability: 0.0423}
