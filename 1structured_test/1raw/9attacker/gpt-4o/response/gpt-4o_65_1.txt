To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the neighborhood statistics, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The event we're interested in is the attack, and we want to update our belief based on the neighborhood's height distribution.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the attack occurred in the given neighborhood.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.20 \) (Probability that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A') = 0.80 \) (Probability that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 1 \) (Probability of the attack given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, assuming the attack happened in that neighborhood)
- \( P(B|A') = 1 \) (Probability of the attack given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, since the attack definitely happened in the neighborhood)

We need:
\( P(A|B) \) = \( \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \)

Since \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|A') \) are both 1, \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') = 1 \cdot 0.20 + 1 \cdot 0.80 = 1 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.20}{1} = 0.20 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
