To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, we should use this information directly.

The probability that a randomly chosen person in that specific neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.20.

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
