To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Let's define the events as follows:

- \(A\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(B\): The attack occurred in the particular neighborhood.

We want to find \(P(A|B)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(B)\) is the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Given:
- In the city, \(P(A) = 0.15\) (15% are 185 cm or taller)
- In the neighborhood, \(P(A|B) = 0.20\) (20% are 185 cm or taller)
- Also in the neighborhood, \(P(B|A) = 0.20\) (20% are 185 cm or taller)

But to use Bayes' theorem, we need \(P(B)\), the overall probability that an individual in the city is in the neighborhood. However, we assume that "neighborhood" refers to a location where the attack has a high conditional probability given the population's height distribution, so we use the neighborhood's height distribution directly.

Therefore, the probability \(P(A|B)\) is directly given by the conditional probability in the neighborhood:

\[ P(A|B) = 0.20 \]

Thus, the correct estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}
