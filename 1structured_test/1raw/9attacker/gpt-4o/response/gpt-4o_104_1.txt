Given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attack occurred in the neighborhood in question.

We know:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B | A) = 0.20 \) (probability that a 185 cm or taller person is from the given neighborhood)
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.80 \) (probability that a person shorter than 185 cm is from the given neighborhood)

We want to find:
- \( P(A | B) \) (probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that they are from the neighborhood)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the person being from the neighborhood, which we can find using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(B) = 0.20 \cdot 0.15 + 0.80 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Then, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.042 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.042.
