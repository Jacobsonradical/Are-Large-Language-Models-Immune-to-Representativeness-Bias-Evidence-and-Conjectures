To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with its own height distribution, we can utilize the concept of conditional probability. Here, the relevant information is the height distribution in that specific neighborhood.

From the investigation, we know:
- In the neighborhood: 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, the most relevant information is the height distribution of the people in that neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is simply the probability that any random person in that neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
