To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( B \) be the event that the attacker came from the neighborhood (since the attack happened there).

Given data:

- \( P(A) \) (prior probability from the city's population) = 0.15
- \( P(B|A) \) (probability that someone 185 cm or taller came from the neighborhood) = 0.20
- \( P(B|A^c) \) (probability that someone shorter than 185 cm came from the neighborhood, where \( A^c \) is the complement of \( A \)) = 0.80
- \( P(A^c) \) (prior probability from the city's population that someone is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

To determine \( P(A|B) \) (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are from the neighborhood), we can apply Bayes' formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that a person from the city comes from the neighborhood. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B) = (0.20 \times 0.15) + (0.80 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now, substitute \( P(B) \) back into Bayes' formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.0423.
