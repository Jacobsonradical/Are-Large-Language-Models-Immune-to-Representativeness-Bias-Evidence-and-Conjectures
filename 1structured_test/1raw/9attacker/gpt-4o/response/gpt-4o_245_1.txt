Given the information provided, we use the neighborhood statistics since the incident occurred in a specific neighborhood. The probability distribution for the heights in the relevant neighborhood is:

- Probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm: 0.80
- Probability of a person being 185 cm or taller: 0.20

We are interested in the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on this distribution. This is directly provided by the neighborhood statistics.

Thus, the estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
