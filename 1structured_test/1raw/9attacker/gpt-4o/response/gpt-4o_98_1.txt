To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( T \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
  
We need to find \( P(T|E) \), where \( E \) is the event that the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood.

Given:
- \( P(T|E) = 0.20 \) (20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(N|E) = 0.80 \) (80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm)

We don't have direct information about the attack itself to modify these probabilities, so the best estimate we can give for \( P(T) \) is simply based on the neighborhood statistics:

\[ P(T|E) = 0.20 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{probability: 0.20\} \]
