Let's clearly identify the information provided and use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability:

1. **Prior probability** of someone being 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood (not taking the attack into account): \( P(T) = 0.20 \).
2. **Prior probability** of someone being shorter than 185 cm in the neighborhood: \( P(S) = 0.80 \).
3. **Probability of the attack occurring given the person is 185 cm or taller**. Since height isn't seen, this probability remains a point of consideration without any further information correlating height to crime.

We assume that height does not affect the likelihood of the attack beyond the given population distribution, as no evidence suggests that height correlates with the likelihood of committing the crime.

Therefore, the solution is embedded in the population distribution of that neighborhood:

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, in the absence of additional information about the attacker's height affecting the likelihood of committing the crime, remains equal to the neighborhood's inherent distribution of heights.

So, the estimate probability is:
{probability: 0.20}
