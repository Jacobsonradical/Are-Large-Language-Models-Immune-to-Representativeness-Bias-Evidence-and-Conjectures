To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a particular neighborhood with known height distributions, we can use Bayesian reasoning.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is from the neighborhood.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are from the neighborhood.

From the problem:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- \( P(A|B) \): Probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller = 0.20
- \( P(B) \): Probability that a person is from the neighborhood = given the problem only gives local neighborhood probabilities, we consider the neighborhood to entirely account for the context of the attack happening there.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood:

\[ P(A|B) = 0.20 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ {probability: 0.20} \]
