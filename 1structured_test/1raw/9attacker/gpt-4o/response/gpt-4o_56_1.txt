To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can calculate it:

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the attack occurred in the neighborhood in question.

We are given:
- \( P(A) \): The overall probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 0.15.
- \( P(A|B) \): The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that they are in the neighborhood, which is 0.20.
- \( P(\neg A) \): The overall probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm in the city, which is 0.85.
- \( P(\neg A|B) \): The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm given that they are in the neighborhood, which is 0.80.

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is equal to the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood, i.e., 0.20.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, regardless of the attacker's height. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

Where \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.80.

Now plugging in the values:

\[
P(B) = (0.20 \times 0.15) + (0.80 \times 0.85)
 \\
P(B) = (0.03) + (0.68) = 0.71
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.15}{0.71} = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \approx 0.0423
\]

So your estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0423}
