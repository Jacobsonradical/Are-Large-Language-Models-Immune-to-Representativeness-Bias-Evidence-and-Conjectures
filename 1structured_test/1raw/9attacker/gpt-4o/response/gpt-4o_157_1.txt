To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the city and neighborhood, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let:
- \( H_1 \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \) be the event of the attack occurring in this particular neighborhood.

We need to find \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in this neighborhood.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E | H_1) = 0.20 \) (probability that a person 185 cm or taller lives in the neighborhood)
- \( P(E | H_2) = 0.80 \) (probability that a person shorter than 185 cm lives in the neighborhood)

To find \( P(E) \), the total probability of the event \( E \) (a person lives in the neighborhood), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.71 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H_1 | E) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{(0.20 \cdot 0.15)}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.0423 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0423}
