To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the detailed calculation:

1. **Define Events:**
   - \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( B \): The attack happened in the neighborhood where 20% are 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \( P(A) \): Probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15.
   - \( P(A|B) \): Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given they are from the neighborhood = 0.20.

Since we have localized information about the neighborhood, we should primarily use \( P(A|B) \).

3. **Using the Neighborhood Data:**

\[
P(A|B) = 0.20
\]

Thus, based on the neighborhood statistics:

\[
\{probability: 0.20\}
\]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% are 185 cm or taller, is 0.20.
