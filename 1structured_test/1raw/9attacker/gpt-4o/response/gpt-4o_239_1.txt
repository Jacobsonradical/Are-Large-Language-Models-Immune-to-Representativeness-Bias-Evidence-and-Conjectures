To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Given:

- 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Since we have no additional information about the attacker apart from the fact that they are a resident of this neighborhood, we will simply use the neighborhood distribution.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
