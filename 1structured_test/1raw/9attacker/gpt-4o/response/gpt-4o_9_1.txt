To solve this probability question, we use Bayes' Theorem. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood. 

Let's define the relevant probabilities:

- Let \( A \) be the event that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B \) be the event that the person is from the specific neighborhood.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the general population proportion being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B | A) = 0.20 \) (the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood)
- \( P(B | A') = 0.80 \) (the proportion of people shorter than 185 cm in the neighborhood, where \( A' \) represents the event of being shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find:
\[ P(A | B) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

To compute \( P(B) \) (the total probability of being from the specific neighborhood), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \]

Thus:
\[ P(B) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 = 0.71 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.0423 \]

Therefore:
{probability: 0.0423}
