To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we can use the information specific to the neighborhood. 

We know that in the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Given this information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be the same as the proportion of such individuals in the neighborhood.

{probability: 0.20}
