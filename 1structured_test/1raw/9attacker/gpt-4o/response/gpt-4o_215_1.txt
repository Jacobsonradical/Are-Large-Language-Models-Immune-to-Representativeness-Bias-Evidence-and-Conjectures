Given the information, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood's height distribution, as the attack occurred in that area. 

In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller. Since we are interested in the probability within the specific context of the neighborhood, we can use the given distribution directly.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
