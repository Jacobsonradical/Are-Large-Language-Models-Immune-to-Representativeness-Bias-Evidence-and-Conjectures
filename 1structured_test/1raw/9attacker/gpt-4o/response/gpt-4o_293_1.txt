To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to focus on the data specific to the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, as the general city data is less relevant for this particular case. According to the neighborhood data:

- 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Based on this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
