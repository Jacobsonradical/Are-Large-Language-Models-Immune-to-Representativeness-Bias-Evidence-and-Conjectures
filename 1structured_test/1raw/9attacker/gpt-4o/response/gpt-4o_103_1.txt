Given the scenario, we can estimate the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller using the information provided by the neighborhood statistics where the attack occurred.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
- The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm (P(Short)) = 80% = 0.80
- The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (P(Tall)) = 20% = 0.20

Since we have no specific evidence about the attacker's height other than the neighborhood statistics, we will use these probabilities directly.

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
