To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the neighborhood statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \) be the neighborhood in question.

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|N) = \frac{P(N|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(N)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|N) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood statistics.
- \( P(N|H) \) is the probability of the neighborhood given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(N) \) is the total probability of the neighborhood.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.20 \) (since 20% of the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(N|H) = 1 \) (if the person is 185 cm or taller, they are in that 20%).
- \( P(N) = 1 \) (since we're considering the neighborhood).

Since \( P(N|H) = 1 \) and \( P(N) = 1 \):

\[ P(H|N) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 1}{1} = 0.20 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ {probability: 0.20} \]
