To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we should use Bayesian reasoning. We'll update the prior probability of the attacker's height based on the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Let's denote the following:
- \( H_1 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( H_2 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

The prior probabilities are given by the population distribution in the city:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.15 \)

However, we need to adjust these based on the neighborhood distribution:
- \( P(H_1 \mid \text{neighborhood}) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(H_2 \mid \text{neighborhood}) = 0.20 \)

Since this event happened in a specific neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood probabilities directly.

Now, we need to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the attack occurred in this neighborhood. Essentially, the neighborhood proportions are already adjusted for this context. Therefore, we can directly interpret \( P(H_2 \mid \text{attack in neighborhood}) \) from the given neighborhood data.

Thus:
{probability: 0.20}
