To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

We are given the following information:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
- The prior probability \( P(A') \) that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.
- In the neighborhood, \( P(B | A) \) (the probability that a person is from this neighborhood given they are 185 cm or taller) is 0.20.
- In the neighborhood, \( P(B | A') \) (the probability that a person is from this neighborhood given they are shorter than 185 cm) is 0.80.

To find the posterior probability \( P(A | B) \), we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability that any person is from the neighborhood:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A') \cdot P(A') \]

Let's calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now, calculate \( P(A | B) \):

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.0423 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.0423}
