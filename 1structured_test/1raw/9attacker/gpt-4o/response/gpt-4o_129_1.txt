Given this scenario, we should use the information relevant to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. According to the information provided:

- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack took place in this specific neighborhood, the relevant probability is directly given by the distribution of heights in that neighborhood.

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
