To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, we should use the information about the population distribution of heights in that neighborhood.

From the problem statement:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

This neighborhood distribution gives us a direct estimate of the probability that a randomly chosen person from that neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be directly derived from the neighborhood distribution.
