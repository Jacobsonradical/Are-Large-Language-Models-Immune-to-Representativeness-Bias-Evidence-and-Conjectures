To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that we know the attacker was from the neighborhood and we have neighborhood-specific height data, we can use that local information directly.

Neighborhood statistics:
- 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Since we are looking for the probability based on the neighborhood data:

{probability: 0.2}
