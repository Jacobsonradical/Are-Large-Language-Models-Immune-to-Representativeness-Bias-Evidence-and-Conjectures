To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood statistics, we use the distribution provided by the neighborhood data rather than the city data. This is because the attack occurred in the neighborhood, and thus, the neighborhood statistics are more relevant.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attacker is equally likely to be randomly selected from the neighborhood population, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Hence, the estimate of the probability is:
{probability: 0.20}
