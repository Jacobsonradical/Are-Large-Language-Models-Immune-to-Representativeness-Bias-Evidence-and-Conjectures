To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information from the neighborhood rather than the entire city since the attack occurred in that specific neighborhood.

Given:
- 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Since the person did not see the attacker, we don't have any additional information to adjust these probabilities. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that tall.

{probability: 0.20}
