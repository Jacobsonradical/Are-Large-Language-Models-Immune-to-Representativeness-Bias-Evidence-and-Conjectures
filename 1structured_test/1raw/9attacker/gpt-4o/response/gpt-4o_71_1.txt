To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information about the neighborhood population distribution, we will use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, we'll use these probabilities as they are more relevant to our context.

Given that there's no other information favoring a different probability, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the neighborhood rate of 20%.

Thus:

{probability: 0.2}
