Given the information, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the known distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, and no other information about the specific attacker's height is provided, our best estimate for the attacker's height is simply the statistical distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is directly given by the neighborhood's distribution.

{probability: 0.2}
