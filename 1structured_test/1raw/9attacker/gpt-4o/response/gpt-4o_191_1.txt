Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (in the city).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood (regardless of height).

### Assigning the given probabilities:
1. **Prior probability \( P(A) \)** :
   - The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%, or \( P(A) = 0.15 \).

2. **Conditional probability \( P(B|A) \)** :
   - The probability that a person who is 185 cm or taller is in the neighborhood is 20%, or \( P(B|A) = 0.20 \).

3. **Total probability \( P(B) \)** :
   - This is the probability that the person is in the neighborhood, which can be calculated by considering both possible heights. 

\[ P(B) = (P(B|A) \cdot P(A)) + (P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)) \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \)

\[ P(B) = (0.20 \times 0.15) + (0.80 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.03) + (0.68) = 0.71 \]

### Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood context is:

\[ \{probability: 0.0423\} \]
