To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Here's the computation step-by-step:

1. **Define the probabilities:**
   - Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is from the neighborhood.

   From the problem statement:
   \[ P(B) = 1 \] (since the attack occurred in the neighborhood)
   \[ P(\text{attacker shorter than 185 cm} \ | \ B) = 0.80 \]
   \[ P(\text{attacker 185 cm or taller} \ | \ B) = 0.20 \]

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]

   Since \( P(B) = 1 \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   P(A | B) = P(A)
   \]

   Given in the neighborhood:
   \[
   P(A) = 0.20
   \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, is:

\[
\{ \text{probability:} \ 0.20 \}
\]
