Given the information about the two populations (the city and the neighborhood), we need to focus on the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in this neighborhood and we have no other information distinguishing between different heights of potential attackers, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller would be the same as the proportion of people that height or taller in the neighborhood.

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.2}
