To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we use the information pertinent to the neighborhood where the attack occurred rather than the general city data. This is because the attack happened in that specific neighborhood and the statistics for the neighborhood will give us a more accurate assessment.

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

Thus, the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
