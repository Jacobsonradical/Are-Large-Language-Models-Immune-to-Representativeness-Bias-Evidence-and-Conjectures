To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since that provides a more accurate context.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of people are 185 cm or taller

Given no other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
