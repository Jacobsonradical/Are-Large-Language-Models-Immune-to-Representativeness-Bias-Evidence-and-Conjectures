To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we need to use Bayesian reasoning. Here's the breakdown of the information:

- \( P(Taller|Neighborhood) = 0.20 \) (The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood)
- \( P(Shorter|Neighborhood) = 0.80 \) (The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm in the neighborhood)

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we assume the attacker is representative of the neighborhood's general population. Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in that neighborhood.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is \(0.20\).

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
