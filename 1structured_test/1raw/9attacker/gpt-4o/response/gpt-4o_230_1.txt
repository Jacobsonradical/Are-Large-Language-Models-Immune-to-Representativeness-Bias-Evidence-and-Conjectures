To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided by the police investigation specifically for the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

According to the information, in this neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we have no other information about the attackerâ€™s height beyond the general statistics for the neighborhood, we use these probabilities directly.

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.2}
