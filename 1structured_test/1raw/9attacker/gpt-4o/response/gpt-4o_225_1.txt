Given the data, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- \( P(Taller) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(Shorter) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
\[ P(Taller) = 0.20 \]
\[ P(Shorter) = 0.80 \]

Since the victim could not see the attacker and we have no other distinguishing features to separate an attacker from a random person in the neighborhood, our best estimate relies solely on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
