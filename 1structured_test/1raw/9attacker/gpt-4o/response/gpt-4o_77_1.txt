To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we use the information specific to the neighborhood in which the attack occurred. According to the information provided:

- \(P(\text{Tall}) = P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.20\)
- \(P(\text{Short}) = P(\text{Height} < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.80\)

Given that the attack happened in this neighborhood, the relevant probabilities we should consider are those specific to the neighborhood demographics.

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
