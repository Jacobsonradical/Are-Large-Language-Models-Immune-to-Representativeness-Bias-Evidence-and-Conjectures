To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the observation made in the specific neighborhood, we should primarily rely on the information pertaining to that neighborhood. The relevant population statistics for the neighborhood indicate that 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since there's no additional specific information about the attacker that would allow us to distinguish between the neighborhood's general population and the attacker, we use the given proportions directly:

{probability: 0.20}
