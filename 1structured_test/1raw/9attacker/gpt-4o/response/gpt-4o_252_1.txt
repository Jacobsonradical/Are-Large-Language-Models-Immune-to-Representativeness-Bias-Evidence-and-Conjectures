To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we use the information provided specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This involves using the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is considered more relevant than the general city population statistics for this particular case.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is directly given by this neighborhood proportion.

{probability: 0.20}
