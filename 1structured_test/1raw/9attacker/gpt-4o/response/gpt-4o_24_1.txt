To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the local neighborhood statistics, we use the information specific to that neighborhood.

According to the investigation:
- 80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Given this local context, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is simply the percentage of people in that neighborhood who meet that criterion.

So, the estimate for the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
