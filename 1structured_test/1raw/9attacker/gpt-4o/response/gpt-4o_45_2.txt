The problem provides two pieces of information about the population height distribution in the city and specifically in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

The city-wide distribution is:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

The neighborhood distribution is:
- 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Since the incident happened in the neighborhood with specific height distribution data, we should base our probability estimate on the neighborhood statistics.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the neighborhood data, is:

{probability: 0.2}
