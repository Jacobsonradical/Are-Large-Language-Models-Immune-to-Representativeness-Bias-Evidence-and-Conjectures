To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of people are 185 cm or taller, we will use the conditional probability based on the information provided.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in this neighborhood and we have no other distinguishing information about the attacker's height, we can assume the attacker's height distribution matches that of the neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
