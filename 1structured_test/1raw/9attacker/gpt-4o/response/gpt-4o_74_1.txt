To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem requires us to consider both the general probability distribution of heights in the city and the specific probability distribution within the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(H) = \) Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(N) = \) Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(L|H) = \) Probability of the attack happening in the neighborhood given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(L|N) = \) Probability of the attack happening in the neighborhood given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(H|L) = \) Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack happened in the neighborhood. This is what we want to estimate.

From the information given:
- In the city: \( P(H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(N) = 0.85 \).
- In the neighborhood: \( P(L|H) = 0.20 \) and \( P(L|N) = 0.80 \).

We want to find \( P(H|L) \). By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|L) = \frac{P(L|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(L)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(L) \), which is the total probability of the attack happening in the neighborhood. This can be obtained using the law of total probability:

\[ P(L) = P(L|H) \cdot P(H) + P(L|N) \cdot P(N) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(L) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(L) = (0.03) + (0.68) \]
\[ P(L) = 0.71 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|L) \):

\[ P(H|L) = \frac{P(L|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(L)} \]
\[ P(H|L) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H|L) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H|L) \approx 0.042 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.042.
