To answer the question, we'll use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. According to the given data, in the neighborhood:

- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller

Since we do not have any other information about the attacker's height, our best estimate of the attacker's height distribution is the same as the neighborhood's population distribution.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is equal to the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.20}
