To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can utilize Bayesian reasoning. 

Given:
- 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, so \(P(\text{shorter}) = 0.80\).
- 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, so \(P(\text{taller}) = 0.20\).

Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we'll assume any person in the neighborhood has an equal chance of being the attacker. Therefore, the prior probabilities are based on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood.

Calculating the probability:

{probability: 0.20}
