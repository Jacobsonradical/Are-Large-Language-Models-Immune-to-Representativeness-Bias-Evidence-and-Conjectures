Given:
- 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Since we do not have any additional specific evidence that differentiates the attacker from the general neighborhood population, our best estimate is the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
