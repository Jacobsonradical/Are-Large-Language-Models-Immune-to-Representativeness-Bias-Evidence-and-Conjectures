Given the information, we need to use the statistics provided for the specific neighborhood because the attack occurred there. The probability we are interested in is the proportion of individuals in that neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

According to the police investigation:
- 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be directly taken from these statistics.

{probability: 0.2}
