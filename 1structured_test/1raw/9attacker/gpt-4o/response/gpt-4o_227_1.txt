To solve this problem, we need to use Bayesian reasoning. Let's denote the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is from the neighborhood.

Given the information:
- \( P(A) \) is the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller = 0.20 (20%).
- \( P(A^c) \) is the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are shorter than 185 cm = 0.80 (80%).

We are tasked with estimating the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

From Bayesian reasoning:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{ P(B|A) \cdot P(A) }{ P(B) } \]

However, given that we don't have any additional evidence \( B \) other than the neighborhood statistics, the posterior probability in this simplified scenario is simply the prior probability of the event in the neighborhood.

Hence,
\[ P(A|B) = 0.20 \]

Thus, 
{probability: 0.20}
