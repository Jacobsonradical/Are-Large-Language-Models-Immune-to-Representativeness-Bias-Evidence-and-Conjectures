Given the new information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we need to use the neighborhood's population distribution instead of the general city distribution.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the only information we have about the attacker is the neighborhood distribution and no additional evidence indicating a specific height, we can directly use the given probabilities.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
