To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use the neighborhood-specific information rather than the city-wide data, since the attack happened in that specific neighborhood.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller should reflect the neighborhood data, as that is the relevant context.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
