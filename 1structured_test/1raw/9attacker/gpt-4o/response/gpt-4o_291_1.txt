Given the information:

- City-wide: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- Neighborhood: 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened specifically in a neighborhood with its own statistics, we should focus on those neighborhood statistics.

In the neighborhood:
- Probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(\text{shorter}) = 0.80 \)
- Probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller: \( P(\text{taller}) = 0.20 \)

Therefore, based on the neighborhood data, the estimate of the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
