To solve this problem, we can use Bayesian probability to update our estimate based on the new information provided by the police investigation.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the person encountered in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the distribution in the neighborhood is known.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which in this case is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of encountering a person who is 185 cm or taller given that we are in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of encountering a person who is 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood.

Given the neighborhood distribution:
- 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm (\( P(B|not\_A) = 0.80 \))
- 20% are 185 cm or taller (\( P(B|A) = 0.20 \))

We need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of encountering a person who is 185 cm or taller, using the law of total probability. 

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|not\_A) \cdot P(not\_A) \]

Here,
- \( P(not\_A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(B|not\_A) = 0.20 \)

So,
\[ P(B) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.20 \]

Therefore, substituting the values back into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.20} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.20} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.15 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.15} \} \]

This matches the prior because the same distribution percentages were present in the conditional neighborhood.
