To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use the information relevant to the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. According to the data provided:

- In the neighborhood, 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
- Therefore, 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Given this, and assuming that the attacker is representative of the neighborhood's population distribution, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
