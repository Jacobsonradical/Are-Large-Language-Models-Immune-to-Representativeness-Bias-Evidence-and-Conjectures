Given the information provided, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the proportions in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

The relevant information is:

- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the investigation is focusing on this neighborhood specifically, we will use the neighborhood proportions to estimate the probability.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \text{Probability (attacker's height â‰¥ 185 cm)} = \frac{20}{100} = 0.2 \]

So, according to the specific conditions in the neighborhood:

{probability: 0.2}
