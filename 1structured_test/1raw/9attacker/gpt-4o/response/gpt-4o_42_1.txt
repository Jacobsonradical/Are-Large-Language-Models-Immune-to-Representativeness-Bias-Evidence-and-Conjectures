Given the scenario and the information provided, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the event occurred in a particular neighborhood. We can use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. 

First, let's denote the following:
- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( B \): The event that the attack occurred in the neighborhood where the distribution of heights is known.

We are looking for \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the event occurred in the neighborhood. Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

From the information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.20 \) (the probability that a person 185 cm or taller is from the neighborhood).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that a person shorter than 185 cm is from the neighborhood).

We also need \( P(B) \), the overall probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, regardless of the height of the attacker. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
P(B) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.71
\]

Now we can find \( P(A|B) \):

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71}
\]
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71}
\]
\[
P(A|B) \approx 0.0423
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.0423 \) or 4.23%.

\[
\{probability: 0.0423\}
\]
