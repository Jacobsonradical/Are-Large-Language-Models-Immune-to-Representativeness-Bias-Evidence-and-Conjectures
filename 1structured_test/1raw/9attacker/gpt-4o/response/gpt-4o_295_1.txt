To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to determine the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack happened in a specific neighborhood.

Let:
- \( H_1 \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( H_2 \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \) be the event that the attack occurred in the neighborhood with given proportions.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:

- \( P(H_1) \) = 0.85 (based on the city population)
- \( P(H_2) \) = 0.15 (based on the city population)
- \( P(N | H_1) \) = 0.80 (in the neighborhood, 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(N | H_2) \) = 0.20 (in the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller)

We want to find \( P(H_2 | N) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H_2 | N) = \frac{P(N | H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(N)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(N) \), the total probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood:

\[
P(N) = P(N | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(N | H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(N) = (0.80 \cdot 0.85) + (0.20 \cdot 0.15)
      = 0.68 + 0.03
      = 0.71
\]

Now, we can plug \( P(N) \) into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H_2 | N) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71}
           = \frac{0.03}{0.71}
           \approx 0.0423
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.0423}
