Given the probabilities related to the height distribution in the city and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, we should use the height distribution of that neighborhood.

In the neighborhood:
- The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm is 80% or 0.80.
- The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller is 20% or 0.20.

Given that this information is directly from the neighborhood where the attack happened, the best estimate for the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
