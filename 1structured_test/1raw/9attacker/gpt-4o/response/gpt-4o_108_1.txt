To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( A \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Let \( B \) denote the event that a randomly chosen person from the neighborhood is the attacker. We need to find \( P(A|B) \).

According to the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.20 \) (probability that someone in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) \) is assumed to be the same in both cases as we are looking uniformly at the neighborhood.

The problem principally asks for \( P(A) \) because the data pertains directly to the neighborhood's demographics.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be directly taken as the percentage of people in that neighborhood meeting the criteria:

\[ P(A) = 0.20 \]

Therefore, our estimate, as per the neighborhood data, is:

{probability: 0.20}
