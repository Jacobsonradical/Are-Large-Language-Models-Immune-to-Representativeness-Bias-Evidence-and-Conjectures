To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided by the police investigation specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. According to the investigation, in that neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Given that there's no specific additional information about the attackerâ€™s height beyond the local neighborhood's statistics, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as the same probability found in that neighborhood.

So, the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
