To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( H_{\text{tall}} \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_{\text{short}} \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H_{\text{tall}} | \text{occurrence in neighborhood}) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We know:
- \( P(\text{occurrence in neighborhood} | H_{\text{tall}}) = 0.20 \) (20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\text{occurrence in neighborhood} | H_{\text{short}}) = 0.80 \) (80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(H_{\text{tall}}) = 0.15 \) (initial probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H_{\text{short}}) = 0.85 \) (initial probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{\text{tall}} | \text{occurrence in neighborhood}) = \frac{P(\text{occurrence in neighborhood} | H_{\text{tall}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{tall}})}{P(\text{occurrence in neighborhood})} \]

Where \( P(\text{occurrence in neighborhood}) \) can be found using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(\text{occurrence in neighborhood}) = P(\text{occurrence in neighborhood} | H_{\text{tall}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{tall}}) + P(\text{occurrence in neighborhood} | H_{\text{short}}) \cdot P(H_{\text{short}}) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(\text{occurrence in neighborhood}) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{occurrence in neighborhood}) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(\text{occurrence in neighborhood}) = 0.71 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_{\text{tall}} | \text{occurrence in neighborhood}) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{tall}} | \text{occurrence in neighborhood}) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(H_{\text{tall}} | \text{occurrence in neighborhood}) \approx 0.0423 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.0423}
