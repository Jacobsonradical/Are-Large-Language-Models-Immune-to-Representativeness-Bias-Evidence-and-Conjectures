To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, let's consider the given information:

- City-wide, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood proportions for our calculation.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%.

So the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
