Given the problem, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, taking into account the relevant statistics for the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Let's denote:
- \( P(\text{Tall}) = 0.20 \): Probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\text{Short}) = 0.80 \): Probability that a person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm.

Since we do not have additional specific evidence pointing towards the attacker's height, we will base the probability solely on the neighborhood's statistical data.

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is equivalent to the probability of any random person in the neighborhood being 185 cm or taller:

{probability: 0.20}
