Given the information that the neighborhood has 20% of people who are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate, based on the local height distribution, is that the attacker's height falls into this demographic category. Since we have no other specific information about the attacker, beyond general population statistics in that neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood distribution to estimate the probability.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
