To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood data, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attack occurred in the neighborhood with height distribution data available.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.2 \) (Probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A') = 0.8 \) (Probability that a person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.2 \) (Conditional probability in the neighborhood given \( A \))
- \( P(B|A') = 0.8 \) (Conditional probability in the neighborhood given \( A' \))

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) is given by the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

Let's calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.2) + (0.8 \cdot 0.8) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.04 + 0.64 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.68 \]

Now, we compute \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.2}{0.68} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.04}{0.68} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0588 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability is:
{probability: 0.0588}
