To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Hereâ€™s how we can apply it in this context:

- Let A be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller".
- Let B be the event "the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood".

Given:
- P(A | B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.
- P(A) is the general probability that any person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B | A) is the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that anyone in the city lives in the neighborhood.

From the problem statement:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B | A) = 0.20 (In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = 0.80 (80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

To find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^{c}) \cdot P(A^{c}) \]
Where:
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

Thus:
\[ P(B) = (0.20 \cdot 0.15) + (0.80 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.71 \]

Now, substituting back to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.0423 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0423}
