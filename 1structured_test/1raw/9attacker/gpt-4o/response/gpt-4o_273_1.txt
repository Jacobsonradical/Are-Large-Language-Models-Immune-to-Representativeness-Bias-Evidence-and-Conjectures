Given the situation, we'll use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is from the given neighborhood.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is from the neighborhood.

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to determine each of these probabilities:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
\[ P(A) = 0.15 \]

2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the attacker is from the neighborhood given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Since there's no specific information suggesting otherwise, we'll assume the probability of being from the neighborhood is independent of the attacker's height.
\[ P(B|A) = P(B) \]

3. \( P(B) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is from the neighborhood and their height distribution is given by the neighborhood statistics.
We'll assume this is reflected by the neighborhood population distribution.
\[ P(B) = 0.20 \]

Given the base rate in the city that 15% of people are 185 cm or taller, and the specific information that in the neighborhood 20% are 185 cm or taller, we can reasonably argue that these specific neighborhood proportions should be used. Hence, we can assume \( P(B) = 0.20 \) and \( P(B|A) = 0.20 \).

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.15}{0.20} = 0.15 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
