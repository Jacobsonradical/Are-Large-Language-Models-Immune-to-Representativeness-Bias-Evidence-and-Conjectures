To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the neighborhood statistics, we should use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we assume no additional evidence other than general neighborhood statistics. Therefore, the probability estimate should be based solely on these proportions.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%.

Thus, the probability is:
{probability: 0.2}
