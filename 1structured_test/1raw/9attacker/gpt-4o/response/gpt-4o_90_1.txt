To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have the following information:

- Probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- Probability that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, \( P(T|N) = 0.20 \)
- Probability that the attacker is from the neighborhood is \( P(N) \)
- Probability that the attacker is from the city, but not from that specific neighborhood, \( P(\bar{N}) = 1 - P(N) \)

However, we're interested in estimating the probability given that the attack occurred in that specific neighborhood, so we use:

\[ P(T|N) = 0.20 \]

Given that the attack happened in the neighborhood and we have no further evidence to distinguish the attacker, we can directly use this probability for the attacker's height.

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
