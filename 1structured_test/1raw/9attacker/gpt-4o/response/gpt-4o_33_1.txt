To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( H_1 \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) be the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.2 \) (the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood).
- \( P(H_2) = 0.8 \) (the prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm in the neighborhood).

Since the victim was attacked from behind and could not see the attacker's height, we have no additional evidence about the height directly from the victim. Therefore, the initial probabilities based on the neighborhood demographics are directly used.

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ P(H_1) = 0.2 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
