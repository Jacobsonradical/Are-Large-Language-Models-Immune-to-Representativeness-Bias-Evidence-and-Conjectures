To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let:

- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( N \) be the event that the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood.

We are given:
- \( P(H|N) = 0.20 \) (probability that a randomly selected person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(S|N) = 0.80 \) (probability that a randomly selected person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm).

Since the attacker is equally likely to be anyone from that neighborhood:

- Initially, we assume the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller \( P(H|N) = 0.20 \).

Because no additional information about the attacker's height is provided (the victim couldn't determine the height), we rely entirely on the given population distribution in the neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller remains the same as the population distribution in the neighborhood.

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller is:
