To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attack occurred in the neighborhood with specific height distribution, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. 

We know the following:

- \( P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) = 0.2 \) (probability of being 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood)
- \( P(\text{Height} < 185 \, \text{cm}) = 0.8 \) (probability of being shorter than 185 cm in the neighborhood)

Since the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, we use the neighborhood-specific height distribution directly rather than the general city population distribution, because it's more relevant for our calculation.

Using Bayes' theorem and only given this information:

\[ P(\text{attacker's height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm} \mid \text{attack happened in the neighborhood}) = P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) \]

The estimate we seek is directly based on the proportion provided for the specific neighborhood:

\[ P(\text{attacker's height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) = 0.2 \]

Thus, the estimate is:

{probability: 0.2}
