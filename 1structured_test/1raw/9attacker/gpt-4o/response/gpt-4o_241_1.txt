Given the scenario, we can use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred to estimate the probability. Since we lack any direct evidence about the attacker's height and we are only given the distribution of heights in the neighborhood, we can assume that any given person in the neighborhood could be the attacker. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller should align with the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
