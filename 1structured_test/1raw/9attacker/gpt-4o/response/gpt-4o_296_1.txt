This problem can be approached using Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( B \): The attack took place in the neighborhood

We are given:
- \( P(A') \): The probability that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm = 0.8
- \( P(A) \): The probability that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller = 0.2

\( P(B|A) \) is essentially 1, as the question inherently assumes the attack occurred in the neighborhood, and the height we're interested in is only segmented by the population statistics of that neighborhood (not the other parts of the city).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Given that the attack definitely happened in the neighborhood \( P(B|A) = 1 \), we have:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{1 \cdot 0.2}{1} = 0.2 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.2}
