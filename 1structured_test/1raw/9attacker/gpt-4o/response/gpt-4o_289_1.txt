Since we are dealing with specific information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we should use these local statistics rather than the general citywide information to estimate the probability.

In the neighborhood:
- The probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm is 80% (0.80).
- The probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller is 20% (0.20).

Given that the attacker was from this neighborhood, the best estimate of the attacker's height would use these neighborhood statistics.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
