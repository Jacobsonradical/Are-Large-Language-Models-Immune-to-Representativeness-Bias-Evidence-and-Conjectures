To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. The relevant probabilities are:

- 80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Given these probabilities, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is directly the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}
