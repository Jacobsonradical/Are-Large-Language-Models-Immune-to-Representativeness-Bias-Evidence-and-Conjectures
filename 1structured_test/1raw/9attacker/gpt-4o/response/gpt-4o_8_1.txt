To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a particular neighborhood, we should use the information provided specific to that neighborhood rather than the entire city. 

In the neighborhood:
- The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm is 80%.
- The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller is 20%.

Given no additional information about the attacker (such as any distinguishing characteristics that could provide more context), we should use these probabilities directly.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
