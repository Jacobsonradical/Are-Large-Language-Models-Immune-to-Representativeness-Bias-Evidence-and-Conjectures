To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the specific neighborhood statistics, we will use those neighborhood statistics directly because they are more relevant to the specific case.

According to the neighborhood data:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given this neighborhood data is directly the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}
