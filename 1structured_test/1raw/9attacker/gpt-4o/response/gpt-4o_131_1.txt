To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we'll use the information provided specifically for that neighborhood.

According to the information:

- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Given that we are interested in determining the probability after already knowing that the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood-specific distribution.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, the estimate is:

{probability: 0.2}
