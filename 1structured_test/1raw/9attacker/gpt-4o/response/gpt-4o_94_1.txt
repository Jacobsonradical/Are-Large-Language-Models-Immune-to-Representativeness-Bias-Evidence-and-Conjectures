To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, taking into account the neighborhood-specific height distribution. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attack occurred in the specific neighborhood.

We want to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in this neighborhood.

From the problem, we have the following information:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \): The probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B | A) = 0.20 \): The probability that a person 185 cm or taller is in the neighborhood.
- \( P(B | A^c) = 0.80 \): The probability that a person shorter than 185 cm is in the neighborhood, where \( A^c \) denotes the complement of \( A \).

First, we need to compute \( P(B) \), the total probability that a person is in the neighborhood:

\[
P(B) = P(B | A)P(A) + P(B | A^c)P(A^c)
\]

Given that \( P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \), we can plug in the values:

\[
P(B) = (0.20 \times 0.15) + (0.80 \times 0.85) 
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.03 + 0.68 = 0.71
\]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{0.20 \times 0.15}{0.71} = \frac{0.03}{0.71} \approx 0.0423
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0423}
