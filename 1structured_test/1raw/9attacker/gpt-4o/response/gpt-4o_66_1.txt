To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to base our calculation on the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Applying Bayes' theorem:

Let's denote:
- \( H \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(H) \): Probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) \): Probability that a person in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E_N \): Event that the attack occurred in this particular neighborhood.

Given data for the neighborhood:
- \( P(H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.80 \)

We want to find \( P(H | E_N) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in this neighborhood.

Since the neighborhood-specific probabilities are given directly:
- \( P(H|E_N) = 0.20 \)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
