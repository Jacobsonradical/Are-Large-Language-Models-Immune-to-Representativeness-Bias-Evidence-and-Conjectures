{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack happened at night and the victim couldn't see their height. Therefore, the best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is simply the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are that tall. 

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker was that tall is 0.2.
