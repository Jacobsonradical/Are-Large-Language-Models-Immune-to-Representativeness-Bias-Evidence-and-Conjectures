{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any specific information about the attacker's height beyond the fact they attacked from behind at night. This means we should rely on the most relevant information available, which is the demographic data from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

The neighborhood data tells us that 20% of people in that area are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information to go on, it's reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as **0.2 (or 20%)**.
