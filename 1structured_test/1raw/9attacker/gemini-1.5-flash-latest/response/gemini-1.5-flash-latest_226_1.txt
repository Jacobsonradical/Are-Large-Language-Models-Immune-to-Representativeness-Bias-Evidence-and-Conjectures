{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack happened at night.  Therefore, the best estimate we can make is to use the information about the neighborhood's height distribution.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
