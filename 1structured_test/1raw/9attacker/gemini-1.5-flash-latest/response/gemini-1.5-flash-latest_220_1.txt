{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We don't have any specific information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack occurred at night, making it impossible to see their height. 

Therefore, the best estimate for the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is based on the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height. 

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate for the probability of the attacker being that height is **0.2**.
