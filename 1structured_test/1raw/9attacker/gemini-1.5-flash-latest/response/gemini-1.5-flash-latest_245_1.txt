{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, they're not directly relevant to the case. We're specifically interested in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

The information provided states that 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
