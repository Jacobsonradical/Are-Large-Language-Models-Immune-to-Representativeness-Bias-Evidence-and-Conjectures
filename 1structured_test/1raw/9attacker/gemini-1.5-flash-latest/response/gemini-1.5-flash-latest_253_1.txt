{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While we don't have information about the attacker's height specifically, the police investigation provides a more relevant statistic for our estimate. Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, it's more likely that the attacker's height aligns with the neighborhood demographics rather than the city-wide average. 

Therefore, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller to be **20%**, which is the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are that height.
