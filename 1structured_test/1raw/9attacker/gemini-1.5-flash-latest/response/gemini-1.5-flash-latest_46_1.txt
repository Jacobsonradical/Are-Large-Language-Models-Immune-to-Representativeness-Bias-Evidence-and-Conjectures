{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* We are given that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. 
* This information is more relevant than the city-wide statistic because the attack happened in the neighborhood, making the neighborhood population the more likely pool of potential attackers.
* Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.
