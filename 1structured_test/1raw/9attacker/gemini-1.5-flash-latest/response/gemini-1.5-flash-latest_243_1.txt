{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can assume that the attacker is equally likely to be any person in the neighborhood.  Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that tall, which is **20% or 0.2**.
