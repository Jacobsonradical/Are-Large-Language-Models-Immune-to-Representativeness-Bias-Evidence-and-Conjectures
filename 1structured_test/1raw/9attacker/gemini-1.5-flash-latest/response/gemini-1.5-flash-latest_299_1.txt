{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know the following:

* **Citywide:** 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood:** 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood's statistics to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. 

Therefore, the probability is **0.2** (20%).
