{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's overall height distribution is not directly relevant to the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.  

We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
