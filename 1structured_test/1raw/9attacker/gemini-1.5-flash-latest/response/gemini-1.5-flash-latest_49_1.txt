{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any specific information about the attacker's height other than the fact they were able to attack from behind. Therefore, the best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are that height. 

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we estimate the probability of the attacker being that height to be 0.2.
