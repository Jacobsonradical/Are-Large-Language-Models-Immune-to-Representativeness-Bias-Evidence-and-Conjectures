{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This is our best available information about the attacker's height, as the victim couldn't see the attacker.  While the city-wide statistics are interesting, they are less relevant to the specific case since the attack happened in a particular neighborhood.
