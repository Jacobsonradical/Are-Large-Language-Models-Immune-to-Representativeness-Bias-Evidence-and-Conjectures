{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given that the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This information is more relevant than the city-wide statistics because the attack occurred in that specific neighborhood.

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).
