{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are that height, which is 20% or 0.2.
