{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  This is the best information we have about the attacker's height, as we know the attack occurred in that neighborhood.  While the citywide statistics are interesting, they are less relevant in this case.

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.
