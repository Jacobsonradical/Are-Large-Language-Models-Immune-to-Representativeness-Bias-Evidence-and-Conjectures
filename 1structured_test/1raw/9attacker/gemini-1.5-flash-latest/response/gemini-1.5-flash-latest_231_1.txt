{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attacker was in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since we have no other information about the attacker's height, the best estimate for the probability that they were 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who meet that criteria.
