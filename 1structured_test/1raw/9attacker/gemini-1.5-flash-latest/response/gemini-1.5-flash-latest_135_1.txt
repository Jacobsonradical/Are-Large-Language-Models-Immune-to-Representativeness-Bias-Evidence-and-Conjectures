{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We know that the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of people 185 cm or taller compared to the city as a whole. While the city has 15% of people 185 cm or taller, the neighborhood has 20%.  

Since we have no other information about the attacker, we can reasonably assume that the attacker is more likely to be representative of the neighborhood population than the city population. 

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
