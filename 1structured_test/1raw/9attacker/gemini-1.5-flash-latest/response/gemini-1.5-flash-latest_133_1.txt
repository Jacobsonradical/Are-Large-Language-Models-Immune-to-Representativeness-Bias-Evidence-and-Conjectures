{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

While the overall city statistics might be helpful, the most relevant information is the neighborhood data.  Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was that height is **0.2**. 

We're using the neighborhood data because it's more specific to the context of the crime.
