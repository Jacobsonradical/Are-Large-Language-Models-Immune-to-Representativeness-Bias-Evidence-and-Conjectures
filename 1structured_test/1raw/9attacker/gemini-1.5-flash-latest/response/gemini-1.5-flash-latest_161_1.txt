{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's overall population height distribution is irrelevant in this case. We're specifically interested in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

The police investigation provides us with the relevant data: 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
