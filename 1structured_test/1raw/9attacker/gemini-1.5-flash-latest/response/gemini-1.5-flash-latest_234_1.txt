{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's overall height distribution is irrelevant in this case.  We're specifically interested in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was that height is **0.2**.
