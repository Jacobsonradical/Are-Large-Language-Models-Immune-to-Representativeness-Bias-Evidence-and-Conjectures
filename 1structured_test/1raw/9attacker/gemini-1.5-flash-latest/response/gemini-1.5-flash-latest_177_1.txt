{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the citywide statistics are interesting, the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood. The relevant information is the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller. 

Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
