{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We don't have any specific information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack happened in a specific neighborhood. Therefore, the best estimate of the probability is the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.
