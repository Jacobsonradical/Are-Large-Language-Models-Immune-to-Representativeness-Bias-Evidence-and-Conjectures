{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, they don't tell us anything about the specific neighborhood where the attack happened. We should focus on the information provided about the neighborhood:

* 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
