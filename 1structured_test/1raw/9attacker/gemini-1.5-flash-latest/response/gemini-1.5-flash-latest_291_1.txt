{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* We know the attacker's height is unknown, but the attack happened in a specific neighborhood.
* The neighborhood's demographics are more relevant than the city's overall demographics in this case.
* The neighborhood has a 20% chance of someone being 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, our best estimate is that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
