{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is simply the percentage of people in that neighborhood who are that tall.
