{probability: 0.2} 

Here's the reasoning:

We don't have any specific information about the attacker's height except that the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. 

Since we have no other information to go on, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that tall.
