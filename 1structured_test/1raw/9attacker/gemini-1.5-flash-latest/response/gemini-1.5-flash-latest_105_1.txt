{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We are given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  This information is more relevant than the city-wide statistics because the attack happened in that specific neighborhood. 

Since we have no other information about the attacker, the most reasonable estimate is to use the neighborhood statistic. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.
