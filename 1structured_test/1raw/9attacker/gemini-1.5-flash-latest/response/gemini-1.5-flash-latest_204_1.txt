{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's overall height distribution is less relevant than the specific data about the neighborhood where the attack occurred.  Since the police investigation revealed that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can use this as our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was that height.
