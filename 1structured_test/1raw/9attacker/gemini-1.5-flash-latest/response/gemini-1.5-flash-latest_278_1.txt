{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know the neighborhood has a higher percentage of people 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the overall city (15%). This indicates that the attacker is more likely to be from that taller group within the neighborhood.

Therefore, while the city average might be 15%, our best estimate based on the neighborhood information is 20%.
