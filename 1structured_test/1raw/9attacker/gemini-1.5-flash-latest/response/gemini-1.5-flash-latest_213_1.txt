{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any specific information about the attacker's height other than the fact they attacked from behind.  Since the attack happened at night, the victim could not see the attacker's height.  

Therefore, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are that tall. This is because we have no reason to believe that the attacker is any more or less likely to be tall than anyone else in the neighborhood.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
