{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, the most relevant information is the neighborhood demographic. Since 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**. 

It's important to note that this is an estimate based on the available information. We don't have any specific information about the attacker, so this probability is based solely on the neighborhood demographics.
