{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While we don't know the attacker's height, we have information about the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.  We know that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  

Since we have no other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height.
