{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the city-wide statistics are relevant, the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with different demographics.  Since the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people taller than 185 cm (20% compared to 15% city-wide), it's reasonable to estimate that the attacker is more likely to be in that taller group.

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the neighborhood's proportion of taller individuals, which is 20% or 0.2.
