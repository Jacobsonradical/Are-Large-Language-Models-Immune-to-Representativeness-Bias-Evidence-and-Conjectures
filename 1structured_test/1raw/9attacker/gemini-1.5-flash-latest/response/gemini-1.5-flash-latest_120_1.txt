{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know the following:

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood:** 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely to reflect the neighborhood's demographics rather than the city's overall demographics. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability is **20%**, which translates to **0.2**.
