{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's population is not relevant to this specific case. We only care about the neighborhood where the attack occurred.  The problem states that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

Since we don't have any other information about the attacker, our best estimate of the probability they were 185 cm or taller is simply the percentage of people in the neighborhood who fit that description.
