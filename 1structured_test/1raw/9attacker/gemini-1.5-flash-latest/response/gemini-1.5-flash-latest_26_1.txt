{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We're given that the attacker was not seen, so we can only use the information about the neighborhood's height distribution.  The police investigation revealed that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
