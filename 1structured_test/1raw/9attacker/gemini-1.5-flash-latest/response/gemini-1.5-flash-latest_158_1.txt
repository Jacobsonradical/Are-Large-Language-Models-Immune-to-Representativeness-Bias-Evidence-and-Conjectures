{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* We know the attacker was not seen, so the only information we have is the prevalence of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 
* The neighborhood has a higher proportion of people 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city as a whole (15%). 
*  While this doesn't guarantee the attacker was tall, it makes it more likely. 
* **Therefore, our best estimate is to use the neighborhood's proportion as our probability: 20% or 0.2.**
