{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack occurred at night, making it impossible to see the attacker's height.  Since we are provided with information about the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we should use that information.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
