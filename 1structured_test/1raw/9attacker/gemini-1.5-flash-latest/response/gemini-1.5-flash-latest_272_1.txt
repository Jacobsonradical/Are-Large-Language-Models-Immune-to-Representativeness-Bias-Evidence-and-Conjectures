{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attacker was unseen, and we only have information about the height distribution of the population in the city and the neighborhood.  Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood's height distribution as our basis for estimating the probability of the attacker's height. 

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is **20%** or **0.2**.
