{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the citywide statistics are relevant, the attack happened in a specific neighborhood where the distribution of heights is different. We should focus on the neighborhood statistics.

The problem states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Since the attacker was from this neighborhood, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply **20%**, or **0.2**.
