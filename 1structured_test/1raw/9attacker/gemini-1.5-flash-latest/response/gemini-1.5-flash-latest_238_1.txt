{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Prior Probability:** We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior belief about the attacker's height.
* **Neighborhood Information:**  The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of people taller than 185 cm (20%) compared to the city average (15%). This information provides evidence that the attacker is more likely to be taller than 185 cm.
* **Estimate:** While we don't have specific details about the attacker's height, the neighborhood data provides a better estimate of the attacker's height than the overall city average. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood proportion of 20%.

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic estimate, not a definitive conclusion.  There's still a chance the attacker could be shorter, but the neighborhood data makes it more likely they are taller.
