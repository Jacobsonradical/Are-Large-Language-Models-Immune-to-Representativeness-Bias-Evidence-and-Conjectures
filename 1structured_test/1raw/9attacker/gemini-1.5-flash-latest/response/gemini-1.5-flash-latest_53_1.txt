{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we don't have any other information about the attacker, we can assume they are representative of the population in that neighborhood. 

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be **0.2**.
