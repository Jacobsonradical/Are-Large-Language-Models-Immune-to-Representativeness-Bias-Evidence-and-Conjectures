{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, the most reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion in the neighborhood.
