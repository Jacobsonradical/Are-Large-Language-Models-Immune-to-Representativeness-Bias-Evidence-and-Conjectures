{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. While we don't know the attacker's height, the most likely scenario is that the attacker's height aligns with the demographic distribution of the neighborhood.  

Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.
