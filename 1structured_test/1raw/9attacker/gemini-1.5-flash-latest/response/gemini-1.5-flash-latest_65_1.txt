{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the overall population statistics are important, the more relevant information is the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being in that height range is also **0.2**. 

We don't have any other information to suggest otherwise, so we're using the neighborhood demographics as our best indicator.
