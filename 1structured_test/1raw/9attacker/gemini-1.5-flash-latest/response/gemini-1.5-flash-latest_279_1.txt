{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We know that the attacker was in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. While the city-wide average is different, the specific neighborhood information is more relevant to this case.  Therefore, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller to be **0.2**.
