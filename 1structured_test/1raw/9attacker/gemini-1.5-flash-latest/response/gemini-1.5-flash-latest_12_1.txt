{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, the most logical estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are that height.
