{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We are given that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  

Since we have no other information about the attacker, the most reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height.
