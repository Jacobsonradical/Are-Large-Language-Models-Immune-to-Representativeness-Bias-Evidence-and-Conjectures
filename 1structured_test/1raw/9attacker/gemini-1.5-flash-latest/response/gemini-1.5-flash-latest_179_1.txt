{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We're given two pieces of information:

1. **City-wide:** 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. **Neighborhood:** 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood statistic to estimate the probability.  This is because the neighborhood data is more specific and likely more relevant to the case than the city-wide data.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2 (or 20%)**.
