{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know the following:

* **Citywide:** 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood:** 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it's more likely that the attacker's height falls within the neighborhood's height distribution. Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **20%**, or **0.2**.
