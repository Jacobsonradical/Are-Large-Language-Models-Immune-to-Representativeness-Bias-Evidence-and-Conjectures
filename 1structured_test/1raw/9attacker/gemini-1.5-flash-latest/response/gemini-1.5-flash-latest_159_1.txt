{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any specific information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack happened at night and the victim couldn't see their height. Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Since 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our estimate of the probability is **0.2**.
