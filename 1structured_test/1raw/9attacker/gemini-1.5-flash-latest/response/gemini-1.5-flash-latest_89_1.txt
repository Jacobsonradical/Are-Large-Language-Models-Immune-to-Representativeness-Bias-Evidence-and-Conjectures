{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any specific information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. 

Since we have no other information to go on, the most reasonable estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height, which is **20% or 0.2**.
