{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, the more relevant information is the neighborhood statistic. The police investigation tells us that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. 

Since we have no other information about the attacker, our best estimate is to use the neighborhood data.  Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).
