{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

While the city-wide statistics are provided, they are not relevant to the case because the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood.  We should focus on the neighborhood statistics. 

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
