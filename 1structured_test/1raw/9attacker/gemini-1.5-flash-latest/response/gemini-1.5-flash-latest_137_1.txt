{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

While the city-wide statistics are helpful, the most relevant information is the neighborhood statistic.  Since the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, we should base our estimate on the local data.

The problem states that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
