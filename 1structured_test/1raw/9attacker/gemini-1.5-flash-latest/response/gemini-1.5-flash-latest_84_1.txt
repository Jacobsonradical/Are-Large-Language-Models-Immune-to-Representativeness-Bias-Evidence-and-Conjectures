{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Since the attack occurred in that neighborhood, it's reasonable to assume the attacker is more likely to be within the height distribution of that specific area. 

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, they are less relevant in this case since the attack happened in a smaller, more localized area. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people that height in the neighborhood, which is 20%.
