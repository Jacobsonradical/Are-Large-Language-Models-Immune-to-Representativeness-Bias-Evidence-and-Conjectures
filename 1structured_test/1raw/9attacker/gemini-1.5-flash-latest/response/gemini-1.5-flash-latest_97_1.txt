{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given that the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  While the overall city statistics are different, the information about the neighborhood is more relevant to our estimate of the attacker's height.

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
