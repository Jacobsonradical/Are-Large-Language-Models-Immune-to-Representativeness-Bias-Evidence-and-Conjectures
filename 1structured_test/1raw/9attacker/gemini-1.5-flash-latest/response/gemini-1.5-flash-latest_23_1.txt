{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. While the overall city population has a different distribution, the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood.

Therefore, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2** (20%). We are basing this estimate on the specific demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
