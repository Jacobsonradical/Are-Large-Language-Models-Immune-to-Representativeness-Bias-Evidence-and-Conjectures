{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* **Prior Information:** We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior belief about the attacker's height.
* **Neighborhood Information:**  The investigation tells us that in the specific neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller. This provides more specific information about the attacker's potential height.
* **Estimate:** Since we have no other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is more likely to align with the neighborhood's demographics. Therefore, we estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller to be **20% (0.2)**. 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate based on limited information. It's possible that the attacker could be from outside the neighborhood, and we are not considering other factors like gender that could influence height.
