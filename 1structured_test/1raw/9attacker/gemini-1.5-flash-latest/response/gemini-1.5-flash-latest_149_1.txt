{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since we have no other information about the attacker, we can assume that the attacker is equally likely to be any of the people in the neighborhood. 

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are that tall, which is 20% or 0.2.
