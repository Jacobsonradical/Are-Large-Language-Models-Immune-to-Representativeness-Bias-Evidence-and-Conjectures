{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the citywide statistics are interesting, the most relevant information is the neighborhood statistic.  Since the attack occurred in that neighborhood, we should base our estimate on the local population. 

The problem states that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
