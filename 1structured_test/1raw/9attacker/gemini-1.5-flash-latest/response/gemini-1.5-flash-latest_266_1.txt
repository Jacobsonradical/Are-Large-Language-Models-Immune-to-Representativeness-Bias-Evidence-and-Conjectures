{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the city-wide statistics are relevant, the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood. The neighborhood's statistics are more informative in this case because they directly relate to the potential pool of attackers. 

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was that height is **0.2**.
