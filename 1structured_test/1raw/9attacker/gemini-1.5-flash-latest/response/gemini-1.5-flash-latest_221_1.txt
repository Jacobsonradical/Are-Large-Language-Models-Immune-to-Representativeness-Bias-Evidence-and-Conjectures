{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can assume that the attacker's height is equally likely to be within any segment of the population. 

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are that tall, which is 20%, or 0.2.
