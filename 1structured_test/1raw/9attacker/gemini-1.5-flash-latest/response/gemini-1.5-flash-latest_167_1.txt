{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given information about the height distribution of the city as a whole and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to use the neighborhood's height distribution. 

The neighborhood data tells us that 20% of people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
