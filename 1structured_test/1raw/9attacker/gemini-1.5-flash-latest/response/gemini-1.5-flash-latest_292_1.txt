{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attacker's height is unknown, but we have information about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood. Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to use the neighborhood's data.

The neighborhood has 20% of people who are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
