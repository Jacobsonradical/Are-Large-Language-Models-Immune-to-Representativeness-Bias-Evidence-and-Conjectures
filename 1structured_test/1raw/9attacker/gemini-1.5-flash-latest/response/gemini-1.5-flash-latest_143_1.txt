While the city-wide statistics are interesting, the most relevant information is the demographic data from the neighborhood where the attack occurred. We know that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
