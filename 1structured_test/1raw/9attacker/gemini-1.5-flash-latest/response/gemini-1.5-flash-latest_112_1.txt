{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This is our best information about the attacker's height since we know the attack happened in that specific location. 

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, they are less relevant in this case because the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution. 

Therefore, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as 20%, or 0.2.
