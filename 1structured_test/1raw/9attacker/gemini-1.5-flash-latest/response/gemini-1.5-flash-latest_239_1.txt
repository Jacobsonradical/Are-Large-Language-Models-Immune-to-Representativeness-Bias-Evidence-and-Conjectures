{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. While the citywide statistics might be different, the information we have about the neighborhood is more relevant to the specific case. 

Therefore, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
