{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, they are not directly relevant to this case.  The police investigation provides a much more relevant piece of information: the neighborhood where the attack happened has 20% of its residents being 185 cm or taller. 

Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the probability that they are 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people that height in the neighborhood where the crime occurred.
