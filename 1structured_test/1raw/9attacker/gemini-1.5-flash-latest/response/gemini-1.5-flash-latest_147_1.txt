{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* **We have prior information:** We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
* **We have new information:**  The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller people (20%). This new information suggests the attacker is more likely to be taller than the city average.
* **Combining the information:** Since the neighborhood has a higher percentage of taller individuals, it's reasonable to assume the attacker is more likely to be taller than the city average. However, we don't have enough information to drastically change our estimate. Therefore, we adjust our prior probability slightly upwards.

While we can't be completely certain, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
