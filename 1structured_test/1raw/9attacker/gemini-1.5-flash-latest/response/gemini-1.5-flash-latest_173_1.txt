{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, we can assume the attacker is equally likely to be any resident in that neighborhood. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height, which is 20% or 0.2.
