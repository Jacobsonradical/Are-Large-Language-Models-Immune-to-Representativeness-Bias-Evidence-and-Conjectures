{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's population is irrelevant.  We are only interested in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

The problem states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. This is our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
