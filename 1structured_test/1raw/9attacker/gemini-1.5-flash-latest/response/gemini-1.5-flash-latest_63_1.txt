{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's population is irrelevant to the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. We are only interested in the probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm given the specific neighborhood's demographics. 

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
