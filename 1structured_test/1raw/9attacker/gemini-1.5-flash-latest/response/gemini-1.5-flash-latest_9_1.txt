{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know the attacker's height is unknown, but we have information about the distribution of heights in the city and the neighborhood.  

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood's height distribution data to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.  

The neighborhood data tells us that 20% of people are 185 cm or taller. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
