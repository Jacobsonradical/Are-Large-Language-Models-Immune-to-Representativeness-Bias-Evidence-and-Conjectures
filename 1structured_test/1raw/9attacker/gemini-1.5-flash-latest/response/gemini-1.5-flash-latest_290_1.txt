{probability: 0.2}

Here's the explanation:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height except that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood.  Therefore, the best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the percentage of people in that neighborhood who are that height.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker was that height is **0.2**.
