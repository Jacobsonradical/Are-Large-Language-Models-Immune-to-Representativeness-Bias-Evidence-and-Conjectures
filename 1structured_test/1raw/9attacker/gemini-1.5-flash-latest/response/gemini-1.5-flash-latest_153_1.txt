{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

The question asks for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood. This means we're looking for a conditional probability.

We know that in the neighborhood:

* 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
* 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can assume there's no other information that would change our prior belief about the attacker's height.  Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who fit that description, which is **0.2**.
