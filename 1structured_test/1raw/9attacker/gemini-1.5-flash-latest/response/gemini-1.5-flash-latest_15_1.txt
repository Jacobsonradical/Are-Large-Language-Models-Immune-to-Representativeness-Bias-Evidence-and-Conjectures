{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to assume the attacker is representative of the neighborhood population. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **20%**, or **0.2**.
