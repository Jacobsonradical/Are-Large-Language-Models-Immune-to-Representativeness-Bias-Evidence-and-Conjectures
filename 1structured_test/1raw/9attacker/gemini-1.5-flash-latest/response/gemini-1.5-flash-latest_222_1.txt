{probability: 0.2} 

Here's the reasoning:

We are given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Since the attack occurred in that neighborhood, it's reasonable to assume the attacker is likely to be representative of the height distribution in that area. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
