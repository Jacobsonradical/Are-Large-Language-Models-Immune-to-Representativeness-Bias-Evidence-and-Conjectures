{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's population is irrelevant because the attack happened in a specific neighborhood.  We should focus on the neighborhood data.

The question asks for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.  We are given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, our estimate of the probability is 0.2.
