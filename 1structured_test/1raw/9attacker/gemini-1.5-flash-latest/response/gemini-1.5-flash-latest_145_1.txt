{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We know that the attacker was in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, we can assume the attacker's height is representative of the neighborhood's population. 

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.
