{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

While the citywide statistics are relevant, the more important information is the neighborhood-specific data. The attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Since we have no other information about the attacker, our best estimate for the probability that they are 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in that height category in the neighborhood.
