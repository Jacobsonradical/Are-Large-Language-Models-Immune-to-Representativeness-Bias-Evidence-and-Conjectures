{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know the following:

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood:** 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood statistic to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. 

Therefore, our estimate is **20%**, which is equivalent to **0.2**.
