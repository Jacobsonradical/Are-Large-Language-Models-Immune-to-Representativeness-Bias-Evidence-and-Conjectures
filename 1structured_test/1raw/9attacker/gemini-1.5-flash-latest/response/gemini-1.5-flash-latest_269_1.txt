{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* We are given that the attacker was not seen, so we have no specific information about their height.
* We are asked to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
* We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
