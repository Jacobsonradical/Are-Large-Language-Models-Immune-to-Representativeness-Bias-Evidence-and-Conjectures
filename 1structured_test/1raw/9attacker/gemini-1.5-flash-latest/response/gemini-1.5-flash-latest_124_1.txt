{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We're given information about the population of the city and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.  Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we should focus on the neighborhood data, as it's more relevant to the potential attacker.

The neighborhood data tells us that 20% of people in that area are 185 cm or taller.  This is our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
