{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  While we don't know the attacker's height, we have no other information to suggest the attacker is more or less likely to be taller than 185 cm than any other person in that neighborhood.  Therefore, the best estimate of the probability is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%, or 0.2.
