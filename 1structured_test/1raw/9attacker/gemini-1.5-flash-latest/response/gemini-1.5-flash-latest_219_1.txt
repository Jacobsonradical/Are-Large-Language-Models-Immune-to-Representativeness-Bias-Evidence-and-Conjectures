{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

While the city-wide statistics are helpful, they are not directly relevant to this case. We are specifically interested in the attacker's height, and we have information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can reasonably estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as **0.2**. 

It's important to note that this is an estimate based on the information provided. The actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors not mentioned in the problem.
