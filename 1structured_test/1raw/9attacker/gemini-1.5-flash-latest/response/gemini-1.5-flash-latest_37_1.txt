{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We're given information about the height distribution in the city and specifically in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, the most reasonable estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height. 

This is because the neighborhood provides a more specific context than the entire city. While the city-wide statistic is useful, the neighborhood information is more relevant to the particular case.

Therefore, the estimated probability is 20%, or 0.2.
