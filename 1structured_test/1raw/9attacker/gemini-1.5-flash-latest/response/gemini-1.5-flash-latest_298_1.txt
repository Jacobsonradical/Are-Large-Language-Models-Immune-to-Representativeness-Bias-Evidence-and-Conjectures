{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* We know the attacker's height was not observed.
* The information about the city's population distribution is not relevant because the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood.
* The information provided about the neighborhood's population distribution is what matters.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood with that height.
