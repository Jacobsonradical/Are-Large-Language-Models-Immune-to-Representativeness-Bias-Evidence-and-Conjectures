{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* We know that the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. 
* We don't have any other information about the attacker's height, so we should assume the attacker's height follows the same distribution as the neighborhood's population.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
