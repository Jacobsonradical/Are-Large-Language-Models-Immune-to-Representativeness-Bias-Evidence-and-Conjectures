{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's overall height distribution is irrelevant.  We only care about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
