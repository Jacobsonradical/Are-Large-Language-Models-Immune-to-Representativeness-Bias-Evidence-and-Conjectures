{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given information about the height distribution in the city as a whole and specifically in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood's height distribution to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. 

The neighborhood data tells us that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
