{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While we don't know the attacker's height, we have information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker was that height at **0.2**.  

This is a Bayesian reasoning approach: we're using the prior information about the neighborhood to update our belief about the attacker's height.
