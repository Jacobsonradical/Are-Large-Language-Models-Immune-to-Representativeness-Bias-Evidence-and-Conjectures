{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, the most relevant information is the neighborhood data.  Since the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, we should use the local information.  The neighborhood data tells us that 20% of people in the area are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
