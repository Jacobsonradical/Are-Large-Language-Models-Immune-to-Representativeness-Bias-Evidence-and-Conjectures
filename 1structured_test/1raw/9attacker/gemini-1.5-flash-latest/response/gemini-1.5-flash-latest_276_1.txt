{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We're given information about the height distribution in the city and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.  Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, the relevant information is the neighborhood's height distribution. 

The problem states that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
