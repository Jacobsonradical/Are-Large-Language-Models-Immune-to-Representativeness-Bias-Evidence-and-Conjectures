{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

* **The relevant information:** We are told that the attack happened in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. 
* **Ignoring extraneous information:** The fact that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm is not relevant to this specific case. We are focused on the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
* **Applying the neighborhood data:** Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was that height is **0.2**. 

This is a Bayesian reasoning approach. We're using the prior information about the neighborhood to estimate the probability of the attacker's height.
