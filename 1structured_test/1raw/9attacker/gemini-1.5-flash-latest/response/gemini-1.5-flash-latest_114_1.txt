{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's population is irrelevant since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood.  We should only consider the data about the neighborhood:

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
