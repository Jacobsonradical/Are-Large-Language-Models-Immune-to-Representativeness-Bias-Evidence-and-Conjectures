{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's overall height distribution is irrelevant since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood.  We should focus on the neighborhood's data.

The problem states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
