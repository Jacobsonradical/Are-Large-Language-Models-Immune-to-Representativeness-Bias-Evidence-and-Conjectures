{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We are given information about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood. Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood's distribution to estimate the probability.

In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
