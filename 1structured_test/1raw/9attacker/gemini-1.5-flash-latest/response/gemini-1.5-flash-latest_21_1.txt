{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. This information is directly relevant to the attacker, as the attack happened within that neighborhood.

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, they don't directly apply to this specific case. The neighborhood data is more relevant as it provides a localized understanding of the population distribution. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2 (or 20%)**.
