{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

While we don't have specific information about the attacker's height, we can use the provided statistics to make an informed estimate. 

The attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This is significantly higher than the city-wide average of 15%. 

Therefore, it's reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is **0.2 (20%)**. This is based on the fact that the attack took place in an area with a higher concentration of individuals in that height range.
