{probability: 0.2} 

Here's the reasoning:

* We know that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
*  While the city-wide statistics are useful, they are less relevant in this case. We're interested in the attacker's height *within the neighborhood* where the attack happened. 
* Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we have no other information to consider.

Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **20%**, which is the proportion of people in that height range in the neighborhood.
