{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* We know the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. 
* While the city-wide statistics are useful, the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with its own demographics.
* Since we have no other information about the attacker's height, the most reasonable estimate is to use the neighborhood's demographic data. 

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (20%).
