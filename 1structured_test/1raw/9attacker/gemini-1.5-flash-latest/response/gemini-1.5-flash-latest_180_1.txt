{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. While the city-wide statistics are different, we don't have any other information about the attacker. Therefore, the most likely estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the neighborhood percentage, which is **0.2**.
