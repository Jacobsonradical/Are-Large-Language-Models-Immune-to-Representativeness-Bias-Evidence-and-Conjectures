{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we have no other information to go on.  

Therefore, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the percentage of people in the neighborhood who fit that description, which is 20%, or 0.2.
