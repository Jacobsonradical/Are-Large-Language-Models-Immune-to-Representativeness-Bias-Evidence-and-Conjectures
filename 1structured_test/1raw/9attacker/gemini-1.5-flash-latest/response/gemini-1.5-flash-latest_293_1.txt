{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This information is more relevant than the citywide statistics since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%.
