{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of people taller than 185 cm compared to the city as a whole.  

While we don't have specific information about the attacker's height, the information about the neighborhood suggests it's more likely that the attacker was taller than 185 cm.  

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability is the proportion of people taller than 185 cm in the neighborhood, which is 20%.
