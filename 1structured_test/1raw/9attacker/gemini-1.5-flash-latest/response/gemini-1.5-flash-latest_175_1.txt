{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack happened at night and the victim couldn't see the attacker's height.  Therefore, the best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

This is because the information about the city's population is irrelevant in this case. The police investigation already gave us a specific figure for the neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
