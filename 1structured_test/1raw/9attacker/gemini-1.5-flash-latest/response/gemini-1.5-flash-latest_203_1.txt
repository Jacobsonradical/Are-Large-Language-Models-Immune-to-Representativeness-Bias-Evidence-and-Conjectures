{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack happened, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can assume the attacker's height is equally likely to be any height within the neighborhood population. 

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are that tall, which is 20% or 0.2.
