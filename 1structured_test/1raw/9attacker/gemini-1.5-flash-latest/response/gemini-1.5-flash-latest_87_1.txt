{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we have no other information to use. Therefore, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height: 20% or 0.2.
