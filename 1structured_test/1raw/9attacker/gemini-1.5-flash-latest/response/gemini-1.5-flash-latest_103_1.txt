{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know the following:

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood:** 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it's more likely the attacker is from that neighborhood, and we should use the neighborhood data to estimate the probability. 

Therefore, our best estimate is that the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **20% or 0.2**.
