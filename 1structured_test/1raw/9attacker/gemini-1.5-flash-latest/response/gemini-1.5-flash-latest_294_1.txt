{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The information about the city's population is irrelevant since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood.  We should only focus on the data provided about the neighborhood.

Since 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
