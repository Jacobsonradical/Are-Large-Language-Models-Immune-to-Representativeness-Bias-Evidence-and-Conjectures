{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, so we can't use any information about the victim's perception. We only have information about the population distribution of height in the city and the neighborhood.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood's height distribution to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability is **0.2**.
