{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can assume that the attacker's height is representative of the neighborhood's population.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
