{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to assume the attacker is likely to be representative of the neighborhood population. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.
