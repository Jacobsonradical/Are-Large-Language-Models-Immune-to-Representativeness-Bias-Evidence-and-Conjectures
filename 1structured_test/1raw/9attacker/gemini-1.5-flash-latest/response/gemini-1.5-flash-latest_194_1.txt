{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given two pieces of information:

1. **City-wide:** 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. **Neighborhood:** 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood data to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, our estimate is **20%**, or **0.2** as a probability.
