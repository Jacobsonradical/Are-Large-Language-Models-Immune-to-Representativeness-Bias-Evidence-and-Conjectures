{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. 

Since we have no other information to suggest the attacker is more or less likely to be in either height group, we can use the neighborhood's proportion as our best estimate.
