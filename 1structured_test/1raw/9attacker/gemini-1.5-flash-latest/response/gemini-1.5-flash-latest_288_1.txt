{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since we have no other information about the attacker, we can reasonably assume the attacker's height is representative of the neighborhood population.

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
