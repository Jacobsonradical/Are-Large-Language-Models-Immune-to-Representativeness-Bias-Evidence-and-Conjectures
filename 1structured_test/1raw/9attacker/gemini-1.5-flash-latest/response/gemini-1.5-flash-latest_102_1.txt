{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that the attacker was in the specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, the most logical estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in that height range in the neighborhood.
