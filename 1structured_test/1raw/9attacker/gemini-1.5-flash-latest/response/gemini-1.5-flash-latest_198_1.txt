{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem provides us with two pieces of information:

1. **General population:** 15% of people in the city are 185 cm or taller.
2. **Neighborhood population:** 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it's more likely the attacker's height aligns with the neighborhood demographics. Therefore, our estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.
