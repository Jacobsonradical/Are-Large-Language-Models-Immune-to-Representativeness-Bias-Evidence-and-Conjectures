{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact they were taller than the victim, as they were behind them. Therefore, the best estimate we can provide is based on the neighborhood's height distribution.

Since 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
