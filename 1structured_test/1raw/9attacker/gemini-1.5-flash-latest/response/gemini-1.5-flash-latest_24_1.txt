{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height specifically. The question is asking for our *estimate* of the probability, given the information provided.  

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to use this statistic as our best estimate of the probability. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an estimate. It's possible the attacker's height is different, but based on the available information, 20% is the most reasonable guess.
