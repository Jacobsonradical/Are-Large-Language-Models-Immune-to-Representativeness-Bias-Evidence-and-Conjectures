{probability: 0.2}

Here's the explanation:

We know the following:

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood:** 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it's more likely the attacker's height aligns with the neighborhood demographics than the city-wide demographics. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **20%**, or **0.2**.
