{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, they are less relevant than the specific neighborhood information. The police investigation tells us that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can reasonably assume that the attacker is representative of the neighborhood population. Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.
