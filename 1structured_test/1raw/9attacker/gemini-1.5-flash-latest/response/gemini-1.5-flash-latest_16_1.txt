{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact they attacked from behind, making height irrelevant. The information about the population's height distribution is meant to be misleading. 

Since we have no information to suggest the attacker's height is different from the average in the neighborhood, the best estimate is the neighborhood's distribution: 20% are 185 cm or taller.
