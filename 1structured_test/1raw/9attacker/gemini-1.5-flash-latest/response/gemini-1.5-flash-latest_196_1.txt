{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Prior Probability:**  We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior belief about the attacker's height.
* **Neighborhood Information:**  The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher percentage (20%) of people 185 cm or taller. This information suggests that the attacker is more likely to be taller than the city average.
* **Estimating the Probability:**  While we don't have specific data on the attacker's height, we can use the neighborhood information to adjust our prior belief. Since the neighborhood has a higher proportion of taller individuals, it's reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is closer to 20% than the city average of 15%.

**Important Note:**  This is a rough estimate based on available information. We can't definitively determine the attacker's height without further evidence.
