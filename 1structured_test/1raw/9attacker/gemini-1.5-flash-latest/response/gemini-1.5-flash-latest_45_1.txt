{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We are given that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we can use this neighborhood statistic as our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
