{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We know that the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  While the overall city population has a different distribution, the relevant information is specific to the neighborhood where the crime occurred. 

Since we have no other information about the attacker, we can reasonably assume the attacker is likely to share the height distribution characteristics of the neighborhood.
