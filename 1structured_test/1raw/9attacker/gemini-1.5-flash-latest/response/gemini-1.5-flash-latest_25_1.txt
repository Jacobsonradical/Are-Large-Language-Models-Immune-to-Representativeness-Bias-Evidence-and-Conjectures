{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that the attacker's height is unknown, and we're asked to estimate the probability that they were 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no specific information about the attacker's height, the best estimate we can make is to use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

The neighborhood has 20% of people who are 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
