{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker is more likely to be from that population than the general population of the city.  Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.
