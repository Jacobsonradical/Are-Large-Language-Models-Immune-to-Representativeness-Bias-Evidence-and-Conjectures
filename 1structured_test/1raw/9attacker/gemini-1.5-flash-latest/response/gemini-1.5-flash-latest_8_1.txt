{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given information about the height distribution in the city and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should focus on the neighborhood's height distribution. 

The neighborhood has 20% of its population being 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be **0.2**.
