{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we can assume that the attacker's height is equally likely to be any height within the neighborhood population.  Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.
