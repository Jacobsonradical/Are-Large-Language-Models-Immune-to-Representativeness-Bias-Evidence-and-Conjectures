{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know the following:

* **General population:** 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood population:** 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood data to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. 

Therefore, our estimate of the probability is 20%, or **0.2**.
