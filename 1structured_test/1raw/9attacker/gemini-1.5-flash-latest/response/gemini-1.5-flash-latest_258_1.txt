{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This is our best available information about the attacker's height. While the city-wide statistics might be useful in other scenarios, they are less relevant in this case.

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
