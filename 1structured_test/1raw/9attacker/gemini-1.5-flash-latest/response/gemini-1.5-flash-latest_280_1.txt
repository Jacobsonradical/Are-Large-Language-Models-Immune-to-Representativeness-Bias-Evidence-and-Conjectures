{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The problem states that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height.
