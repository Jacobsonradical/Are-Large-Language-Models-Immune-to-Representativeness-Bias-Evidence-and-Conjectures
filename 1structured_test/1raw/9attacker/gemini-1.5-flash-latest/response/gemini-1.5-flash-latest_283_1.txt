{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the overall city population has a different distribution of heights, we're specifically interested in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

The information provided states that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
