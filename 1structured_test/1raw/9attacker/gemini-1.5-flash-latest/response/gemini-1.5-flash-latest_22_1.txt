{probability: 0.2}

Here's the explanation:

We are given that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since we have no other information about the attacker, we can assume that the attacker's height is likely to be distributed similarly to the population of the neighborhood. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
