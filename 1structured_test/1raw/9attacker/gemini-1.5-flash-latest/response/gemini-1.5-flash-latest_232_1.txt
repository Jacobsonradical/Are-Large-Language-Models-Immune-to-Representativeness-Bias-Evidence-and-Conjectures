{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This information is more relevant than the city-wide statistic because the attack occurred in that specific neighborhood. 

Since we have no other information about the attacker, we can reasonably assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height.
