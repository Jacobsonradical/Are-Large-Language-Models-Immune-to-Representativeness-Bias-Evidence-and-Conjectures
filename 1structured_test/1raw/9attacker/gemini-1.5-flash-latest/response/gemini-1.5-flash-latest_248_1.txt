{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.  While the city-wide statistics are different, the attack occurred in a specific location.  

Therefore, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the same as the neighborhood statistic: **20% or 0.2**.
