{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* We know the attack happened in a neighborhood with a different height distribution than the general city population.
* The neighborhood has a higher percentage of people 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city as a whole (15%).
* While we don't know the attacker's height, the information provided suggests a higher likelihood of the attacker being taller than 185 cm because they are more prevalent in the neighborhood. 
* Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is estimated to be **0.2**.
