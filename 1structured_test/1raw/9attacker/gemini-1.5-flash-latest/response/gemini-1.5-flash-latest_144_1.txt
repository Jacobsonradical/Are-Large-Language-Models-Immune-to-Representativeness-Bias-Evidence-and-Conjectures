{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the city-wide statistics are relevant, the information about the neighborhood is more crucial in this case.  Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood statistics to estimate the probability. 

The neighborhood has 20% of its population 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
