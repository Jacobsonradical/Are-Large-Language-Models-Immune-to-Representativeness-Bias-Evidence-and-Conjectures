{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given information about the height distribution in the city and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.  Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, the attacker is more likely to be from that neighborhood than from the city at large. Therefore, we should use the neighborhood's height distribution to estimate the probability.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  This is our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
