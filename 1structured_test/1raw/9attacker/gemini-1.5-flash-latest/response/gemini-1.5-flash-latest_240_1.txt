{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given that in the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller. Since we have no other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker's height follows the same distribution as the neighborhood population. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
