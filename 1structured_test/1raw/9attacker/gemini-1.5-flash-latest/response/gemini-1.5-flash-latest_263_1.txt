{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We don't have any specific information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack happened in a specific neighborhood.  The most logical estimate, then, is to use the height distribution of that neighborhood.  

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller to be **0.2**.
