{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack happened, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can assume that the attacker's height is equally likely to fall within any of the height distributions in the neighborhood.  

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that tall, which is 20% or 0.2.
