{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's population is irrelevant because the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with different height demographics. We only need to focus on the neighborhood's statistics.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being that height is **0.2**.
