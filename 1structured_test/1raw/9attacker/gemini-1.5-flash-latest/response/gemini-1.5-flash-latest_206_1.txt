{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

The information about the city's overall height distribution is not directly relevant since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood. 

The police investigation tells us that in the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
