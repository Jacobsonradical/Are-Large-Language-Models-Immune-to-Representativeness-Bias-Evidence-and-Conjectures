{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

The information about the city's overall population distribution is irrelevant in this case.  We only care about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was that height is **0.2**.
