{probability: 0.2} 

Here's the reasoning:

While we don't know the attacker's height, the information provided suggests that the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller individuals compared to the city as a whole. 

Since the neighborhood has 20% of people 185 cm or taller, compared to the city's 15%, it's reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is **0.2** (or 20%).
