{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, they don't directly apply to this situation. We're interested in the probability of the attacker being tall *given* they live in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.  The neighborhood information provides a much more relevant base rate.

Since 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was that height is **0.2**.
