{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we can assume that the attacker's height is equally likely to be in any of the height ranges within the neighborhood population. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height, which is 20% or 0.2.
