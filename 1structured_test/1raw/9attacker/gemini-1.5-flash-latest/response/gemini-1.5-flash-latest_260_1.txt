{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, the most relevant information is the neighborhood statistic.  The police investigation tells us that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. 

Since we have no other information about the attacker, our best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height.
