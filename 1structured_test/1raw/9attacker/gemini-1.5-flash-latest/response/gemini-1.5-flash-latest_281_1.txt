{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since we have no other information about the attacker, the most logical estimate is to assume the attacker is representative of the neighborhood population. 

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood with that height, which is 20% or 0.2.
