{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While we know the overall population distribution of heights, the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution.  Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, we should use the information specific to that location.

The problem states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
