{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* We know that in the neighborhood where the attack happened, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
* Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we have no other information to go on.
* Therefore, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height. 

While the information about the city's population is given, it's not relevant to this specific case as we are focused on the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
