{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since we have no other information about the attacker, the most logical estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is simply the percentage of people in the neighborhood who meet that criteria.
