{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that they attacked from behind at night, making the victim unable to see their height. Therefore, the best estimate of the probability is based on the neighborhood's population distribution.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
