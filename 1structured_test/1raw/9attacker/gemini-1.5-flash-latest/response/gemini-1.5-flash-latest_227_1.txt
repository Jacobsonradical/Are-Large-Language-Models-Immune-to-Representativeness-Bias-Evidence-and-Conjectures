{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We are given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since we have no other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is likely to be representative of the neighborhood's population.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2.
