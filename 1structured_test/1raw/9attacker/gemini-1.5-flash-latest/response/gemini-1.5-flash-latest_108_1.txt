{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given information about the height distribution in the city and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.  Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, the most relevant information is the height distribution in the *neighborhood* where the attack happened.

The problem states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
