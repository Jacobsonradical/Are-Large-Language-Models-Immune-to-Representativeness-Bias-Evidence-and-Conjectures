{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We are given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since we have no other information about the attacker, the most logical estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion in the neighborhood: 20% or 0.2.
