{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given that in the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since we have no other information about the attacker, we can assume that the attacker's height is likely to be distributed according to the neighborhood's population. 

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height, which is 20% or 0.2.
