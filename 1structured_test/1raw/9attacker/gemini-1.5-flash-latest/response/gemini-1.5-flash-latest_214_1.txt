{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We don't have any specific information about the attacker's height other than the fact they attacked from behind, making the victim unable to see their height. Therefore, the best estimate we can make is based on the prevalence of people 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

Since 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
