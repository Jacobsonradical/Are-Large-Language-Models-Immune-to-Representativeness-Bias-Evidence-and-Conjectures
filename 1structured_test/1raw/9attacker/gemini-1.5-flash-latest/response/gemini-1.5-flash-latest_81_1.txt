{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know the following:

* **Citywide:** 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood:** 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it's more likely that the attacker's height aligns with the neighborhood's demographic than the city's overall demographic.  

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **20%**, which translates to **0.2**.
