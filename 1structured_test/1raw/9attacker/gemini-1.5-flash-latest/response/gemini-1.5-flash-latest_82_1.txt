{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While we don't know the attacker's height, we can use the information provided about the neighborhood to estimate the probability. Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.

It's important to note that this is just an estimate. We're making the assumption that the attacker is a random person from the neighborhood, which might not be true.
