{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given that the attacker was not seen, so we need to use the information about the neighborhood to estimate the probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm.

Since 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being that height is also **0.2**.
