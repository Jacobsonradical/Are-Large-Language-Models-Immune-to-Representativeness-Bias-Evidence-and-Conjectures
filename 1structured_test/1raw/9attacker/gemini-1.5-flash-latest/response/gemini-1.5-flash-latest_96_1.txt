{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height besides the fact that they attacked from behind, meaning the victim couldn't see them.  

Therefore, the best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are that height. 

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability is 0.2.
