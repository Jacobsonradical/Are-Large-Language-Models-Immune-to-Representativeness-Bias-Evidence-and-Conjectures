{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We're given two pieces of information:

1. **City-wide:** 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. **Neighborhood:** 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood statistic as our best estimate.  Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **20%, or 0.2**.
