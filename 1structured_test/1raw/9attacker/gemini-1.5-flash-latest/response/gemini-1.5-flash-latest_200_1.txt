{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

The problem states that the victim could not see the attacker's height.  This means we should base our estimate on the general population of the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

The information provided tells us that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
