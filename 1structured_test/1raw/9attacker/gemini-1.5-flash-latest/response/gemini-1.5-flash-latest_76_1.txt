{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's overall height distribution is irrelevant in this case.  We're specifically interested in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.  The provided information tells us that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
