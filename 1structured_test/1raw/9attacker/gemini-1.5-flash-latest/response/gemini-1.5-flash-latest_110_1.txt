{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact they were able to attack from behind, meaning we can't use any physical characteristics to narrow down the possibilities.

Since we know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being in this height category is **0.2**.

It's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the available information. We don't have any evidence to suggest the attacker is more likely to be taller or shorter than average for the neighborhood.
