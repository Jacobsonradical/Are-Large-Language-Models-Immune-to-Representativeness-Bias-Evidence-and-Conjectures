{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know the attacker was in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This information is more relevant than the city-wide statistics because the attack happened in that specific neighborhood.

Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.
