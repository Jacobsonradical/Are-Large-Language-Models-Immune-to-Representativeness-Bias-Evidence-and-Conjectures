{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* **We're given a specific piece of information:** The attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
* **This is the most relevant information:**  While the overall city statistics are interesting, they don't directly apply to the specific location of the attack. 
* **The neighborhood data is our best indicator:** Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it's reasonable to assume the attacker is more likely to be within the height distribution of that neighborhood.

Therefore, the best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is **0.2 (or 20%)**.
