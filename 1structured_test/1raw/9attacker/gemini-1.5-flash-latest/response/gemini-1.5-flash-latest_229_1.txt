{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given that the attacker was not seen, so we can only use the information about the neighborhood's population distribution.  

The problem states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
