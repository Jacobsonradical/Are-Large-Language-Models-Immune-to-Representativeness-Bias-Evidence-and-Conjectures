{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We're given information about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.  Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood's height distribution to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller. This is our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
