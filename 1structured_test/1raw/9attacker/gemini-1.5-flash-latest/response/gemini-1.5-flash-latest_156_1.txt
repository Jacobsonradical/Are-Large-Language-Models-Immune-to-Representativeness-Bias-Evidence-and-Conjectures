{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While we know the general population statistics, the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution.  The information about the neighborhood is the most relevant to this case. Since 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was that height is **0.2**.
