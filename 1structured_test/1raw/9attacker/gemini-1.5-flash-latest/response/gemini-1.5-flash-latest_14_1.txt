{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. While the citywide statistics are useful, the most relevant information is the specific data from the neighborhood where the crime happened. Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the probability they are 185 cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people in that neighborhood who are that height.
