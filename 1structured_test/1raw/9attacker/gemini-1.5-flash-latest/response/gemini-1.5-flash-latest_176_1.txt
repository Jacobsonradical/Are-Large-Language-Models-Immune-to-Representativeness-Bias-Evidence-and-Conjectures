{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given information about the height distribution in the city and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. We know that the attacker's height is unknown, but we have to rely on the available data to make an estimate.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to consider the height distribution of that specific area rather than the entire city. 

The neighborhood has a 20% proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
