{probability: 0.2}

Here's the explanation:

We know the following:

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood:** 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it's more likely the attacker's height is consistent with the neighborhood demographics. Therefore, we estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller to be **20%**, or **0.2**.
