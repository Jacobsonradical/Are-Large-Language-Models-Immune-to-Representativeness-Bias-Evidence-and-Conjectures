{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. While the citywide statistics are useful, the neighborhood statistics are more relevant because the attacker is more likely to be from that specific area. 

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.
