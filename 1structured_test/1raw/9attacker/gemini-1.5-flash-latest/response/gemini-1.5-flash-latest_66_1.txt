{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  

Since we have no reason to believe the attacker is any more or less likely to be tall than the general population of the neighborhood, the best estimate of the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is simply the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are that height.
