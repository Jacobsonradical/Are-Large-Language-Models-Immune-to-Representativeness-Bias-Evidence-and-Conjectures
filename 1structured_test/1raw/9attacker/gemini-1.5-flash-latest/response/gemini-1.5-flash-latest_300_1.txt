{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We know that the attack happened in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, the most logical estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
