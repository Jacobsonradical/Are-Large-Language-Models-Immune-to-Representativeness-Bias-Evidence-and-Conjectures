{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the citywide statistics are helpful, they are less relevant than the specific neighborhood data.  The attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  

Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in that height range in the neighborhood, which is 20%.
