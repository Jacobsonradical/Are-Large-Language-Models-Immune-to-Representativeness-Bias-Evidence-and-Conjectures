{probability: 0.2}

Here's the explanation:

While we don't know the attacker's height, we have information about the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, it's more relevant to consider the local height distribution than the citywide distribution. 

The neighborhood has 20% of people who are 185 cm or taller. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
