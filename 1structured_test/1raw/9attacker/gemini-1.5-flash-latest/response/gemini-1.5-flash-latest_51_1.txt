{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller. Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we can reasonably assume that the attacker's height is likely to be representative of the neighborhood's population. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
