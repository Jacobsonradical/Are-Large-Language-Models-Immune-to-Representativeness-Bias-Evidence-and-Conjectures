{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any specific information about the attacker's height other than the fact that they attacked from behind at night, making it impossible for the victim to see their height.

Therefore, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height. 

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, that's our best estimate for the probability of the attacker being that height.
