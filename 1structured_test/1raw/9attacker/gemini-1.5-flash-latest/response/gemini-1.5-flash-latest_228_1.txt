{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, the most relevant information is the neighborhood demographic.  Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should use the local information:

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.** 

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
