{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This is our best available information, as the victim couldn't see the attacker's height.

While the city-wide statistics are provided, they are less relevant to this specific case.  The neighborhood data is a more accurate reflection of the possible pool of attackers.

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
