{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know the following:

* **Citywide:** 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood:** 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it's more likely that the attacker's height aligns with the neighborhood's demographic. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is **20%**, or **0.2**.
