{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attacker was likely from the neighborhood where the attack took place.  Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that there's a 20% chance the attacker was that height. 

While we have information about the city as a whole, it's less relevant because the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with a different demographic.
