{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of people are 185 cm or taller. Since we have no reason to believe the attacker is any more or less likely to be taller than average in that neighborhood, the best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who meet that criteria: 20%, or 0.2.
