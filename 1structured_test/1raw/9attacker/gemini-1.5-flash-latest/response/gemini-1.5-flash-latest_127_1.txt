{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no reason to believe the attacker is any more or less likely to be in that height range than the general population of the neighborhood, the best estimate of the probability is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2.
