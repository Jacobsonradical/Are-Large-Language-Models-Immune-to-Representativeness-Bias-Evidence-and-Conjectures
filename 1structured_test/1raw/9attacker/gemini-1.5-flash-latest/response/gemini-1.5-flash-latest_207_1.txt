{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

The information about the city's overall population height distribution is not directly relevant to the specific neighborhood where the attack happened.  

Since the police investigation revealed that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
