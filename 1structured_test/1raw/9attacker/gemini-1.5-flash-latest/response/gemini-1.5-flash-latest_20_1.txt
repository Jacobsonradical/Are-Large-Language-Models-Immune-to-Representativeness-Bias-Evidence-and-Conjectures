{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller. While we don't know the attacker's height, the information about the city-wide population is irrelevant to this specific case. 

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood statistics. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
