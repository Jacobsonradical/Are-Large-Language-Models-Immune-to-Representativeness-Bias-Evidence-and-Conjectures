{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This information is more relevant to the specific case than the city-wide statistics, as it reflects the demographics of the potential pool of attackers in the immediate area. 

Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).
