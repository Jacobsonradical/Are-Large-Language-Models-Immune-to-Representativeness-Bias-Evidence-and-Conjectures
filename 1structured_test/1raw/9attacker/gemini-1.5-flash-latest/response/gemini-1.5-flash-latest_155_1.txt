{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* **The information about the city is irrelevant.** We are only concerned with the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
* **The problem states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.** This is the best available information to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, our estimate is **0.2**.
