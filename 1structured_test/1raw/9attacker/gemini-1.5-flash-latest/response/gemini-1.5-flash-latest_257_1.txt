{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people taller than 185 cm compared to the city as a whole.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to assume the attacker's height is likely to be representative of the neighborhood. 

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%, which is the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height.
