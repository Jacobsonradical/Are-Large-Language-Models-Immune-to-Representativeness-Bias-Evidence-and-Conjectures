{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

While the city-wide statistics are relevant, the more important information is the neighborhood statistic.  Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should base our estimate on the local population distribution.

The neighborhood data tells us that 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
