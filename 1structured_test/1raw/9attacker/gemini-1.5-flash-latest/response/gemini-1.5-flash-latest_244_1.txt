{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, the most logical estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height.
