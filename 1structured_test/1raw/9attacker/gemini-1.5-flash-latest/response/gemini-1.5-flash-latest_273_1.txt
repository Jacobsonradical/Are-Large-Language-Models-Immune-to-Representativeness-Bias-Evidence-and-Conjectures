{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that the attacker's height is unknown, but we have information about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to consider the height distribution of that specific area. We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
