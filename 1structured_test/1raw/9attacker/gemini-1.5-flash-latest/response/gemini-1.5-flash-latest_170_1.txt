{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  While we don't have specific information about the attacker's height, the best estimate we can make is to assume the attacker is representative of the neighborhood population. 

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).
