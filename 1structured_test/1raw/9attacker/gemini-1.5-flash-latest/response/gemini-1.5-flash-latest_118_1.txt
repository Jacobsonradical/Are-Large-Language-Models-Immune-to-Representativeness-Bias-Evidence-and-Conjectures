{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack occurred in a neighborhood with a different height distribution than the city as a whole.  

Since the neighborhood has a higher percentage of people 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city (15%), it's reasonable to assume the attacker is more likely to be in that taller range. 

Therefore, our best estimate is to use the neighborhood's percentage as our probability: 20% or 0.2.
