{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who fit that description.
