{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. While the broader city statistic is helpful, it's less relevant in this case since we're specifically interested in the neighborhood where the attack happened. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
