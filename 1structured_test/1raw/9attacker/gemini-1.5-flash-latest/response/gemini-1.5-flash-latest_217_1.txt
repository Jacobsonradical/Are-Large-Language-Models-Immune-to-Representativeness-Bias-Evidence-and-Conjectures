{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given information about the height distribution in the city as a whole and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.  Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, the relevant information is the height distribution within that neighborhood.

We know that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
