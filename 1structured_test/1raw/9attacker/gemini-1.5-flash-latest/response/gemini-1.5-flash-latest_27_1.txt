{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We are given that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in that height range in the neighborhood.
