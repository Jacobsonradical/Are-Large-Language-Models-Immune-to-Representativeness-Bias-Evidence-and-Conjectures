{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Prior Probability:** Before we know anything about the attack, we know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
* **Likelihood:**  The information about the neighborhood tells us that the likelihood of someone being 185 cm or taller in that specific area is 20%. 
* **Posterior Probability:**  We need to combine the prior probability with the likelihood to get our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Since we don't have any other information about the attacker, we can simply use the neighborhood's proportion as our estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 20% or 0.2.
