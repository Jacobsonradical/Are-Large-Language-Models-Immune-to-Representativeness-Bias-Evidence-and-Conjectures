{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height from the victim's perspective. We only know the general height distribution in the city and the specific neighborhood. 

Therefore, the best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that tall.  Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability is 0.2.
