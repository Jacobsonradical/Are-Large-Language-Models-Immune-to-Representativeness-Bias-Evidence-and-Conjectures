{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know the following:

* **Citywide:** 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood:** 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it's more likely that the attacker's height aligns with the neighborhood's distribution, rather than the citywide distribution. 

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
