{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We're given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  Since the attack occurred in that neighborhood, it's reasonable to assume the attacker is more likely to be within the height distribution of that neighborhood. 

While the citywide statistics are helpful, they don't directly apply to the specific neighborhood where the crime occurred. The neighborhood's higher percentage of taller individuals makes it more likely that the attacker was taller than 185 cm.
