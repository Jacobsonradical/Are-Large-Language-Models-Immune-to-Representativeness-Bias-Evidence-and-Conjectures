{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We know the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people taller than 185 cm compared to the city overall.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who fit that description.
