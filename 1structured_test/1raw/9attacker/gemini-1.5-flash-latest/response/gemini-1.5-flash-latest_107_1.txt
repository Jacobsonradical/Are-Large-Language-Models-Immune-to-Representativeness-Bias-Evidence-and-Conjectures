{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack happened in a specific neighborhood. Therefore, the best estimate of the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the percentage of people in that neighborhood who are that tall. 

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our estimate for the probability is 0.2.
