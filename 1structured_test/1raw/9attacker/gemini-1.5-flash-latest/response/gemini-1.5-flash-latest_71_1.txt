{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We're given information about the population's height distribution in the city and in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.  Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood's data to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

The neighborhood data tells us that 20% of people in that area are 185 cm or taller.  This is our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was that height.
