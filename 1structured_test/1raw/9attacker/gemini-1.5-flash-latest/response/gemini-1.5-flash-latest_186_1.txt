{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood. Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.
