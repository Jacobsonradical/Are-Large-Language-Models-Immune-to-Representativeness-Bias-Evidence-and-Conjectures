{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While the citywide statistics are useful, the more relevant information is the neighborhood-specific data. The police investigation revealed that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

Since we have no other information about the attacker, our best estimate is to use the neighborhood data. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.2 (or 20%).
