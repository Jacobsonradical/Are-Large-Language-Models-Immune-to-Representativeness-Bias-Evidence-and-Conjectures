{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know the following:

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood:** 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood statistics to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. 

Therefore, our best estimate is **0.2**.
