{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. This is the best available information we have about the attacker's height. 

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, they are less relevant because the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with potentially different demographics.

Therefore, the most logical estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
