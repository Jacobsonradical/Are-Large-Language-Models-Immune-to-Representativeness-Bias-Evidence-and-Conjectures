{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Prior Probability:** We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior belief about the attacker's height.
* **Neighborhood Information:** The neighborhood has a higher proportion (20%) of people 185 cm or taller compared to the city average (15%). 
* **Estimate:**  Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, it's reasonable to adjust our prior probability based on this new information. The neighborhood information suggests the attacker is more likely to be taller than the city average. 

While we don't have enough information for a precise calculation, a reasonable estimate is to use the neighborhood proportion as our new probability.
