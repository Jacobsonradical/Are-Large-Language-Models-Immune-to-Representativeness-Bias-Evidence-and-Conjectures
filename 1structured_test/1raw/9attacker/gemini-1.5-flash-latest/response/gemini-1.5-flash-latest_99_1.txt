{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We know that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, the most logical estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in that height range in the neighborhood.
