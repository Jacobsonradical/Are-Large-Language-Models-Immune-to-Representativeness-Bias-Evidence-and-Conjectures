{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller. Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can assume the attacker is equally likely to be any height within the neighborhood's population distribution.

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height, which is 20% or 0.2.
