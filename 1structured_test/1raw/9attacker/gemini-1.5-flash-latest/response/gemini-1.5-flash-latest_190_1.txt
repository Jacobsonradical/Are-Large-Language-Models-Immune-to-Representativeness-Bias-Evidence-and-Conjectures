{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the percentage of people in the neighborhood who fit that description. 

It's important to note that this is a very basic estimate.  We're assuming that the attacker is a random person from the neighborhood, which may not be the case.  However, without more information, this is the most reasonable estimate we can make.
