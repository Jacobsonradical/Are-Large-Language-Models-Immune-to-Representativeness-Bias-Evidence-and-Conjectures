{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* **We don't have any specific information about the attacker's height.**  We only know the general distribution of heights in the city and the specific neighborhood. 
* **The most likely scenario is that the attacker's height is similar to the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.** Since 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being that tall as 0.2. 

**Important Note:** This is a very basic estimate. In a real investigation, many other factors would be considered, such as:

* **Witness descriptions:**  Even if the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, other witnesses might have.
* **Evidence at the scene:**  Footprints, DNA, or other evidence could help narrow down the possibilities.
* **Suspect pool:**  The police investigation would likely identify potential suspects, and their heights would be considered.
