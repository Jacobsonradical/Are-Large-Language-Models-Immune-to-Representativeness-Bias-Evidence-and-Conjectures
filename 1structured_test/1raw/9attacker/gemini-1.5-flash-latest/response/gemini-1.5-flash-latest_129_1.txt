{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given information about the overall population and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. The attack victim couldn't see the attacker's height, so we need to consider the probability based on the neighborhood's demographics. 

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**. 

We are not given any other information about the attacker, so we can't make any more refined assumptions about their height.
