{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that they attacked from behind at night, making it impossible for the victim to see their height. 

Therefore, the best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height, which is **20% or 0.2**. 

It's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the information provided. The actual probability could be different depending on other factors that we don't know about.
