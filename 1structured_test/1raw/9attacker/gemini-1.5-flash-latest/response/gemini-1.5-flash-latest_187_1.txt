{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height.
