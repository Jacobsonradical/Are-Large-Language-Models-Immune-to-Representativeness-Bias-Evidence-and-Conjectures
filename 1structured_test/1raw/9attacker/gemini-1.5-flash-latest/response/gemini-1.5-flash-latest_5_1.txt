{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's overall height distribution is irrelevant in this case. We are only interested in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

The police investigation tells us that **20%** of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, we can assume this 20% represents the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
