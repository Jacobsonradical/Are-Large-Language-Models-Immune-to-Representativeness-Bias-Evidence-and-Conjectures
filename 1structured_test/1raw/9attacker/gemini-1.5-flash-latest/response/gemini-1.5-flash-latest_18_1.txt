{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given that the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who fit that description.
