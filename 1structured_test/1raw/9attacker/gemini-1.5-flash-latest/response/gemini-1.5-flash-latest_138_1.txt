{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We don't have any specific information about the attacker's height other than the fact they attacked from behind.  Since the attack occurred at night, the victim couldn't see the attacker's height.  Therefore, the best we can do is use the information about the neighborhood's height distribution.

The neighborhood has 20% of people who are 185 cm or taller.  This is our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
