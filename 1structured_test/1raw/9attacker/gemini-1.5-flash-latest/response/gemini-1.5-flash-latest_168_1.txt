{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We are given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. This is the best available information we have about the attacker's height, since the victim couldn't see the attacker. 

While the city-wide statistic is different, it's not as relevant to this specific case. We should base our estimate on the local information, which suggests a 20% chance the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
