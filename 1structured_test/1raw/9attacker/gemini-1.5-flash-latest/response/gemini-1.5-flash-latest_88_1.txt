{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

We know that the attacker was in the neighborhood where 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the probability that they are 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who fit that description.
