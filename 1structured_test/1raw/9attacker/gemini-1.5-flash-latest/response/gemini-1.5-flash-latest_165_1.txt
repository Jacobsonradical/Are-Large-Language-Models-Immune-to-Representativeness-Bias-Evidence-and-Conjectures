{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  While the city-wide statistic of 15% is relevant, the neighborhood data is more specific and therefore a better indicator of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
