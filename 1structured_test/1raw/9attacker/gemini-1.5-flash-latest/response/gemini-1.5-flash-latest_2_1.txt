{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no other information to rely on.  Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height, which is 20% or 0.2.
