{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's overall height distribution is irrelevant in this case.  We are only interested in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.  Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
