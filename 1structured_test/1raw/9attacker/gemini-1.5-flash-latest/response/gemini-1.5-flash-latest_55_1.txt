{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, they are not directly relevant to the case. We're focused on the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

The police investigation provides us with the relevant data: 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
