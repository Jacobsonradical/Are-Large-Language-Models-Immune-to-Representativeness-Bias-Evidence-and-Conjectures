{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know the following:

* **Citywide:** 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood:** 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more likely the attacker's height aligns with the neighborhood demographics than the citywide average. 

Therefore, our best estimate is that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is **0.2 (or 20%)**.
