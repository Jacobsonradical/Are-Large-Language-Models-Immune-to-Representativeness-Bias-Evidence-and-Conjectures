{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we have no other information to work with.  Therefore, the most likely estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are that height.
