{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information to go on, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are that tall.
