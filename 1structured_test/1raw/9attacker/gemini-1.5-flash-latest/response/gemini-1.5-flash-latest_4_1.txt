{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The information about the city's population is irrelevant. We're only concerned with the neighborhood where the attack happened.  Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
