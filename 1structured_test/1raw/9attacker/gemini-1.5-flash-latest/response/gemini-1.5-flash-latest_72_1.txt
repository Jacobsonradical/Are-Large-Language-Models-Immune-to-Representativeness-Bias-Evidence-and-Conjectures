{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We know the following:

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood:** 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that tall. 

Therefore, our estimate is **0.2**.
