{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to assume the attacker's height is distributed similarly to the neighborhood population. 

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 20%, or 0.2.
