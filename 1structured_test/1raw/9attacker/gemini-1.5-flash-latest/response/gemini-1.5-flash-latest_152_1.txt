{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that the attacker's height is unknown, and the victim couldn't see the attacker.  Therefore, we can only rely on the information about the population distribution of height in the neighborhood.

The question asks for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.  In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.  

Since we have no other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is representative of the neighborhood's population.  Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
