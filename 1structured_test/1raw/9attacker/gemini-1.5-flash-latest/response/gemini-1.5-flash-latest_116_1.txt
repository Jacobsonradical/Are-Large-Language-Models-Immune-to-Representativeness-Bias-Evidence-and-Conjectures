{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

While we don't know the attacker's height, the information provided suggests that the neighborhood's height distribution is relevant. We know that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we have no other information to use. Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height, which is **0.2**.
