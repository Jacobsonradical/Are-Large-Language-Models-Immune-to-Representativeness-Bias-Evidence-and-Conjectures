{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* **Prior Probability:** We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
* **Neighborhood Information:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher percentage (20%) of people 185 cm or taller. This suggests that the attacker is more likely to be tall than the average person in the city.
* **Lack of Other Information:** We have no other information about the attacker's height. We don't know their gender, age, or any other factors that could influence their height.

**Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the neighborhood's proportion of tall people, which is 0.2.**
