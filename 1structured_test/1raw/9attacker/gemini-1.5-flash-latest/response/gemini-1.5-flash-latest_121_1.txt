{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* **The information about the city is irrelevant.** The question specifically asks about the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
* **The neighborhood data provides the direct probability.** The problem states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
