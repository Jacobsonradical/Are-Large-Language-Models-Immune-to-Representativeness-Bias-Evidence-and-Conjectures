{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We are given that the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people taller than 185 cm compared to the city as a whole.  Since we have no other information about the attacker, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker is likely to have a height that is representative of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 20%, which is the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.
