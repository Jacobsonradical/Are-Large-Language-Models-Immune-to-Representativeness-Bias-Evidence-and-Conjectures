{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

We don't have any information about the attacker's height specifically, beyond the fact that they attacked from behind, making it impossible for the victim to see. 

The most logical approach is to use the information about the neighborhood where the attack happened.  We are told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

Therefore, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **0.2**.
