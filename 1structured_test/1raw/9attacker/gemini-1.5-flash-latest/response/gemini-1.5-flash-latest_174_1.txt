{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

While the city-wide statistics are interesting, they are not directly relevant to the attack. We are specifically interested in the neighborhood where the attack happened. The information about the neighborhood tells us that 20% of the people living there are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
