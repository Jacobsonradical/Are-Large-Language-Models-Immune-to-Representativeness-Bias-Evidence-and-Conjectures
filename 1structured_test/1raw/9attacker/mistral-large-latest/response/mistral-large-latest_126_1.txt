To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution than the general city population, we should use the neighborhood statistics for our estimate.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
