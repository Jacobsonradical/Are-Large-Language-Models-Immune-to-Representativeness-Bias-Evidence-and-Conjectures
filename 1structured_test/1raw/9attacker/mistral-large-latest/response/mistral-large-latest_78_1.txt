To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the relevant information provided. The city-wide statistics indicate that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, the police investigation found that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Given that the attack happened in this particular neighborhood, it is more appropriate to use the neighborhood-specific statistics rather than the city-wide statistics. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is based on the neighborhood data.

{probability: 0.20}
