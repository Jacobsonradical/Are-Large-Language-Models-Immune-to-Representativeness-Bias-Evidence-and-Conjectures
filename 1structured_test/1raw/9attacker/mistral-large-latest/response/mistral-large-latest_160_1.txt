To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the specific information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, rather than the general city population.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Given this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is directly related to the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
