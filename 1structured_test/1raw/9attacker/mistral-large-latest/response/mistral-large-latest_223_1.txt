To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should use the statistics from that neighborhood rather than the general city statistics.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the neighborhood statistics, is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
