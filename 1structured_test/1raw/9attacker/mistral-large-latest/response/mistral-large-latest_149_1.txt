To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can consider the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution compared to the general city population, it is more relevant to use the neighborhood statistics.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
