To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. The neighborhood statistics are more relevant than the city-wide statistics because the attack happened in that specific area.

Given that in the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
