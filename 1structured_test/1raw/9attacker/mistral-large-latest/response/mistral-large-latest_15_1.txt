To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the relevant information provided. The city-wide statistics indicate that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, while the neighborhood-specific statistics indicate that 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, the neighborhood-specific statistics are more relevant to our estimation. Therefore, we should use the 20% figure from the neighborhood.

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
