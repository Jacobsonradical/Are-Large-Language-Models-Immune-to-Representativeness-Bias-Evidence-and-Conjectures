To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. The neighborhood statistics indicate that 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
