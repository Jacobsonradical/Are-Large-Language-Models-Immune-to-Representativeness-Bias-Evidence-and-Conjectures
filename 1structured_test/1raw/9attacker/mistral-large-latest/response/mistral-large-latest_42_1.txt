{probability: 0.2}

Explanation: Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, and we have no other information about the attacker, we should use the statistics from that neighborhood to estimate the probability. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
