Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated by considering the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. In that neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
