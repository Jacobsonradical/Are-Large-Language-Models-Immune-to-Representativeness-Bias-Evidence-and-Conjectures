To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, this local statistic is more relevant than the city-wide statistic.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
