To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the information provided about the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more relevant to the incident than the general city statistics.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
