To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information given about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. The neighborhood statistics are more relevant to the specific incident than the general city statistics.

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can use this percentage as our estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability is:

\[
\text{{probability: 0.20}}
\]
