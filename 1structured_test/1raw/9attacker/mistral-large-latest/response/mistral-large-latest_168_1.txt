To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as this is more specific and relevant to the incident.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Given this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability is:

{
  "probability": 0.20
