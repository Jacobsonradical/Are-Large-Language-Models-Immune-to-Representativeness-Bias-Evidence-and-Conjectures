To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. According to the police investigation, 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
