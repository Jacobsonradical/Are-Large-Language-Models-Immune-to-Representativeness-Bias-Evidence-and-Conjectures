To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the relevant information provided. The general population statistics indicate that 15% of people are 185 cm or taller, while the specific neighborhood statistics indicate that 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood where the statistics differ from the general population, it is more appropriate to use the neighborhood statistics for our estimate.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
