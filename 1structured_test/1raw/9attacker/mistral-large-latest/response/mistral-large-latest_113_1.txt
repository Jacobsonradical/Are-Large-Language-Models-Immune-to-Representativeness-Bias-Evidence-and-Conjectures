To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the relevant information provided. The key piece of information is the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as this is the most specific and relevant context for the event.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Given this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability is:

  "probability": 0.20
