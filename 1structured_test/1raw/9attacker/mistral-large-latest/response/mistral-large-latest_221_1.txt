To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the specific neighborhood statistics rather than the general city statistics, as the attack occurred in that neighborhood.

Given that in the neighborhood:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
