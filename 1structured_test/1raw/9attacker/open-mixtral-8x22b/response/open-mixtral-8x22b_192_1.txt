Given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, and without any other specific information about the attacker, it's reasonable to base our estimate on the general height distribution of that neighborhood.

If we assume that the attacker was randomly chosen from the population of that neighborhood, then the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller would be equal to the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
