Given the information, if we assume that the attacker was randomly selected from the population of the neighborhood, we could use the neighborhood's height distribution to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, as 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

However, this is a simplification and assumes that height is the only factor and that the attacker was randomly selected from the population. In reality, other factors could influence the probability, such as the time of the attack, the attacker's motive, and the victim's relation to the attacker.

But based on the provided information, the estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
