Given the information, we can't definitively determine the attacker's height. However, we can make a probabilistic estimate based on the population statistics provided.

In the city, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion is higher, at 20%. Therefore, if we assume that the attacker's height is a random variable drawn from the height distribution of the neighborhood population, we would estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.2, or 20%.

Please note that this is a statistical estimate and not a certainty. The actual height of the attacker may vary.
