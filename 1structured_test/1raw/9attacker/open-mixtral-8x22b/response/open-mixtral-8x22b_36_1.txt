Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This is a case of using prior probabilities to estimate the likelihood of an event.

In this case, the prior probability is the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood, which is 20%.

While it might be tempting to consider the overall city's height distribution, the more relevant data for this specific case is the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This is because the attacker likely resides in or frequently visits the area.

Therefore, based on the given information, my estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
