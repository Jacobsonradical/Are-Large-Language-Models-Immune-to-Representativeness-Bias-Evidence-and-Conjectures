Based on the given information, we can see that the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller compared to the city as a whole. However, we should be cautious in using this information, as it does not necessarily mean that the attacker was more likely to be from this taller group.

The probability that a random person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20%. This information alone does not provide a definitive probability that the attacker was of that height. However, in the absence of any other information, we might use this neighborhood-specific probability as a rough estimate for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

But note that this is a very rough estimate. The actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors not provided in the question, such as whether the attacker was a resident of the neighborhood, the attacker's motivation, etc.

Given these considerations, my estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2, based on the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller}
