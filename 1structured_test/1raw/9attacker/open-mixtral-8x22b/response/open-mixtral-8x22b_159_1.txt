Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of height in the city and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Since 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we can assume that these proportions reflect the general height distribution in the city. However, the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller individuals (20% are 185 cm or taller) compared to the city's average.

To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as a more specific reference. Since 20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that there is a 20%, or 0.2, probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumes that the height distribution in the neighborhood is representative of the attacker's height distribution. In reality, other factors could influence the attacker's height, such as the specific circumstances of the attack or the attacker's personal characteristics.
