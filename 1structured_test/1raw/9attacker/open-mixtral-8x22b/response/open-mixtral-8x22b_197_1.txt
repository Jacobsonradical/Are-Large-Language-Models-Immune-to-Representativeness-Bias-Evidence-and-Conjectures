The problem presents us with two different distributions of height in the population: one for the entire city and one for the specific neighborhood where the attack took place. Since the attacker was not identified, it is reasonable to consider the distribution of heights in the neighborhood as more relevant than the city-wide distribution.

Therefore, we'll use the neighborhood distribution to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker belongs to this group is also 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.

This reasoning assumes that the height of the attacker is independent of the fact that they committed the attack. In other words, being taller does not make someone more or less likely to have committed the crime.
