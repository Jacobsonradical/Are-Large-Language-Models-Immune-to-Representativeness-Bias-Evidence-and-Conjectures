Given the information, we know that in the city 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and in the specific neighborhood, this percentage is even higher at 20%. However, we cannot directly use the neighborhood percentage to estimate the probability of the attacker's height because the attacker might not necessarily be a resident of that neighborhood.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it might be reasonable to assume that the attacker is more likely to come from the neighborhood population than the city population as a whole. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller could be somewhere between the city percentage and the neighborhood percentage, leaning more toward the neighborhood percentage.

However, without specific information about the attacker or their origin, we can only make an educated guess. Therefore, I would estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.18, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This estimate is not definitive and is subject to change with more information. It is simply a best guess based on the data provided.
