Given the information, we can't definitively say that the attacker is taller than 185 cm. However, we can make an estimate based on the available data.

The fact that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, compared to 15% in the city as a whole, suggests that there might be a slightly higher probability that the attacker is in this taller group.

However, this doesn't account for other factors such as the time of the attack (which might suggest opportunity for certain height groups), any specific targeting of the victim, or any other relevant circumstances.

So, based solely on the height statistics, we might estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller to be slightly higher than 15%, but less than 20% (since other factors could also influence the probability).

Let's say, for the sake of estimation, the probability is 18%.

Final answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.18}
