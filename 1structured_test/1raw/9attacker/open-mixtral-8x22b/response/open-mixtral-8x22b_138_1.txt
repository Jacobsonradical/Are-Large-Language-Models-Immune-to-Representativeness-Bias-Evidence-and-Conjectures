Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the victim did not see the attacker, we cannot use any identifying features or witness accounts. Therefore, we must rely on the statistical distribution of heights in the neighborhood.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This means that, if we were to randomly select a person from the neighborhood, there would be a 20% chance (or 0.2 probability) that the person would be 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that this probability is an estimate and not a certainty. The actual probability may be higher or lower depending on other factors not mentioned in the information provided.

Here's the probability in the requested format:
{probability: 0.2}
