Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is also 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.

This assumes that the attacker is a random person from the neighborhood and that there is no other information available to suggest otherwise. It is important to note that this is an estimate, and the true probability could be different.
