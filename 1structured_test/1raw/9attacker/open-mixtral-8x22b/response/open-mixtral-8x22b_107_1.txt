Based on the information provided, the general population of the city has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller. However, the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher percentage, 20%, of people who are 185 cm or taller. Since the attacker was from this neighborhood, it is more likely that the attacker was 185 cm or taller compared to the general population of the city. Therefore, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be the percentage of people in that height range in the neighborhood.

{probability: 0.20}
