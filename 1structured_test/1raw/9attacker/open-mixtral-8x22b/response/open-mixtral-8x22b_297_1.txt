Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the neighborhood statistics, as the attack occurred there.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood is 20%. This is because 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

It's important to note that this is an estimate based on the given data and assumes that height is the only factor and the attacker was randomly selected from the population. In reality, there could be other factors that affect the probability, such as the time of the attack, the attacker's motivation, and other personal characteristics of the attacker.

So, following the requested format, the estimated probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
