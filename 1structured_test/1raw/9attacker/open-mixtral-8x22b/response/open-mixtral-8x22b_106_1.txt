Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the neighborhood statistics since the attack took place there.

The police investigation revealed that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Since the victim could not see the attacker's height and was attacked from behind, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is a random variable following the height distribution of the neighborhood population. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height or greater.
