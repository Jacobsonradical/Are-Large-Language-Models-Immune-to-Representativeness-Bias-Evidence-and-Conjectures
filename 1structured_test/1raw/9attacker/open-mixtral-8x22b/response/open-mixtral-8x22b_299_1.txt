To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred. However, it's important to note that we are making an assumption that the attacker was a resident of the neighborhood.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, which is our baseline. But since the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it seems reasonable to adjust our estimate upwards.

However, we cannot simply use 20% as our estimate because we don't know for certain that the attacker was a resident of the neighborhood. Therefore, we might want to take a weighted average of the city's overall distribution and the neighborhood's distribution, with more weight given to the neighborhood's distribution.

Let's say we give 70% weight to the neighborhood's distribution and 30% weight to the city's distribution (this is an arbitrary choice for the example, as we don't have the exact data to make a precise calculation). Then the estimated probability would be:

0.7 * 0.2 + 0.3 * 0.15 = 0.14 + 0.045 = 0.185

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.185.

{probability: 0.185}
