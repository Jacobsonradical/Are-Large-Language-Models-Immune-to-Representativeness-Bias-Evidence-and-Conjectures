Given that the attacker's height is unknown, we can use the information provided about the population heights to estimate the probability. Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, it makes sense to use the height distribution of that neighborhood rather than the entire city.

In this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on this information alone, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

However, it's important to note that this is a very rough estimate and actual probability may vary. Other factors not mentioned here, such as specific eyewitness accounts or physical evidence, could influence the probability.

Here's the format you requested:
{probability: 0.2}
