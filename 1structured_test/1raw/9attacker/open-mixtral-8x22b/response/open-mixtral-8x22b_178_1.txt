Based on the information provided, it would be reasonable to consider the height distribution of the neighborhood as more relevant to the attacker's height than the height distribution of the entire city. This is because people living in the same neighborhood might be more likely to interact with each other, and thus, a person from the neighborhood might have attacked the victim.

Given that 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, it seems reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as 0.2. However, it is important to note that the actual probability could be different, as the height distribution of attackers might not perfectly follow the overall height distribution in the neighborhood.
