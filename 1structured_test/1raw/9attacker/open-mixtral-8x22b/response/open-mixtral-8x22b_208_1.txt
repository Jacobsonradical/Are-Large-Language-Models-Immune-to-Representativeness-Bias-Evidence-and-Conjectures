Based on the given information, it appears that the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller individuals (185 cm or taller) compared to the city as a whole. However, without any other specific information about the attacker or additional evidence, we can only make a rough estimate based on the given proportions.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can use this as our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
