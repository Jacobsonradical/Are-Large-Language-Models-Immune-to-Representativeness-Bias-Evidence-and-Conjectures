Based on the information provided, it seems that the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the neighborhood where the attack occurred than in the city as a whole. However, since we don't have any other specific information about the attacker, we can only use the neighborhood's height distribution as an estimate.

So, given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is also 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.

{probability: 0.2}
