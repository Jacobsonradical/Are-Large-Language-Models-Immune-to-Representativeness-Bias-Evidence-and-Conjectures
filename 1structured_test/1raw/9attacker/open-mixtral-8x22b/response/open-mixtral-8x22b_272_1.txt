Considering that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where the proportion of taller people (185 cm or taller) is higher (20%) than the city's average (15%), it's reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is also higher than the city's average.

However, the exact height of the attacker is still uncertain, as we don't have any direct evidence. Therefore, we can only use the neighborhood's height distribution as a reference.

Based on this information, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
