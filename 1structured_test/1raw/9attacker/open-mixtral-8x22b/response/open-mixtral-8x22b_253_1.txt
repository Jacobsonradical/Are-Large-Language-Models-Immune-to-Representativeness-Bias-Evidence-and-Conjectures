Based on the information provided, the general population of the city has a higher percentage of individuals who are shorter than 185 cm (85%) compared to the neighborhood in which the attack occurred (80%). This means that the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%) than the city's average (15%).

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is more likely to follow the distribution of the neighborhood's population than the city's population. Therefore, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.20, or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
