Given the information, we can't definitively determine the attacker's height, as we don't have any direct evidence. However, we can make an estimation based on the available data.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller would be higher in the neighborhood where the crime occurred compared to the city as a whole, as the proportion of people 185 cm or taller is higher in that neighborhood (20% compared to 15% in the city).

Since the height of the attacker could not be determined, and the crime occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Here's the strict format:
{probability: 0.2}
