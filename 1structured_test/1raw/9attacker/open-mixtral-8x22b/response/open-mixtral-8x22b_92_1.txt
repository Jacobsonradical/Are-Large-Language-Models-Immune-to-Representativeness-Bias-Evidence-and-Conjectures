Given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, and we have no other specific information about the attacker, it is reasonable to use this statistic as a starting point. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate and not a certainty, as the actual probability could be influenced by other factors not included in the information provided.

That being said, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.2, or 20%.

Here's the reasoning:
{probability: 0.2}
