Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the population statistics of the city and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Since the attacker's height is unknown, we can use the height distribution of the population as a prior probability. In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, we have additional information that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as a more specific prior probability. This is because the attack occurred in that specific neighborhood, and it is reasonable to assume that the attacker is more likely to be from the neighborhood population than the general city population.

Therefore, based on the neighborhood's height distribution, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20.
