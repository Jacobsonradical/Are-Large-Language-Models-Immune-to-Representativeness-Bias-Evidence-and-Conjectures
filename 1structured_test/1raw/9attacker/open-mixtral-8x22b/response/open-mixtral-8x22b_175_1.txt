Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would depend on the specific neighborhood in which the attack occurred, as the height distribution in this neighborhood differs from the city as a whole.

Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, it follows that 20% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that if an individual is chosen at random from this neighborhood, there is a 20% chance that they are 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that this is a statistical inference and may not reflect the actual height of the attacker. It's also possible that the attacker is not a resident of the neighborhood.

That being said, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.2 (or 20%).
