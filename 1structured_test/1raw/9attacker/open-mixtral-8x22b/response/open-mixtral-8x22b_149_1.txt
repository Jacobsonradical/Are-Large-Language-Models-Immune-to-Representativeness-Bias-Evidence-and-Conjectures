Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be higher in the neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the overall city population. This is because the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city overall (15%).

However, it's important to note that this doesn't guarantee that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. It's a probability estimate based on the given population statistics.
