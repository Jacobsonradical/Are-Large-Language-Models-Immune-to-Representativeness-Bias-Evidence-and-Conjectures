Based on the information provided, we know that in the city as a whole, there is an 85% chance that a random individual is shorter than 185 cm and a 15% chance that they are 185 cm or taller. However, in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, the distribution of heights is different: there is an 80% chance that a random individual is shorter than 185 cm and a 20% chance that they are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, it would be more informative to use the neighborhood's height distribution to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.
