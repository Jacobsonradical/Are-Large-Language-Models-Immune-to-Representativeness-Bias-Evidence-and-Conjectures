Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and not a certainty.

The overall population of the city has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion is higher at 20%. Since the attacker is from this neighborhood, it's reasonable to use this local statistic for our estimate.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2 or 20%.
