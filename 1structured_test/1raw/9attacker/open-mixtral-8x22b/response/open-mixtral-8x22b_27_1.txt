Based on the information provided, the fact that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller gives us a baseline probability. However, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than the city's average.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we could consider the height distribution in the neighborhood. Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we could use this as an estimate for the probability that the attacker falls into this height range.

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and not a certainty. The actual probability could be different if there are other factors at play that we're not aware of.
