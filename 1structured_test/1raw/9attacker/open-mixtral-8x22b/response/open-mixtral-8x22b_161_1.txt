After considering the given information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood. Since the attack occurred in this particular neighborhood, we should consider the local height distribution.

The information states that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Without any further information about the attacker, such as physical evidence suggesting a specific height or eyewitness accounts, we are left to rely on this statistical data.

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
