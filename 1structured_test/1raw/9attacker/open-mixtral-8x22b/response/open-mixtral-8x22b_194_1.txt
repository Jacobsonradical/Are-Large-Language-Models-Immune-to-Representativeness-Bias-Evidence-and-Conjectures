Based on the information provided, we can make an educated guess about the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, we must remember that this is just a statistical estimate and does not guarantee the actual height of the attacker.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where this proportion is higher, with 20% of the population being 185 cm or taller.

Since the crime occurred in this neighborhood, it might be more reasonable to use the neighborhood's statistics rather than the city's overall statistics. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be based on the neighborhood statistics.

{probability: 0.20, which corresponds to 20%}
