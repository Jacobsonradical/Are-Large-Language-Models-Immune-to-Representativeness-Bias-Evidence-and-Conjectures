Based on the information provided, we can see that in the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion increases to 20%.

Since the attacker was not identified and there are no other clues regarding their height, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as a more specific reference. Therefore, we estimate that the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.20, based on the neighborhood's height distribution.

{probability: 0.20}
