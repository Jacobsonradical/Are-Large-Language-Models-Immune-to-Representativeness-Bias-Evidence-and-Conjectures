Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood statistics. Since the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city average (15%), it is reasonable to assume that the attacker is more likely to have come from this taller subset of the population.

However, we cannot definitively conclude that the attacker was 185 cm or taller without additional evidence, as the attacker could still be from the 80% of the population who are shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, our estimate will be based on the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood.

{probability: 0.20}

This means there's a 20% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the given neighborhood statistics.
