Based on the information given, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, this could be taken as a rough estimate for the probability that the attacker was in this height range.

However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and not a certainty. The actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors not mentioned, such as whether the attacker was a resident of the neighborhood or just passing through, or whether there are other height-related factors that might influence the likelihood of someone being an attacker.

The answer in the requested format would be:
{probability: 0.2, based on the given information and assuming the attacker is a resident of the neighborhood}
