Based on the information provided, we know that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since the attacker is more likely to be from the neighborhood due to the location of the attack, we can use the neighborhood statistics for our estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
