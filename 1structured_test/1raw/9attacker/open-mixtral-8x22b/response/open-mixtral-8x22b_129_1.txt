Given the information, it's important to note that we cannot determine the exact probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as we do not have enough information about the attacker or the specific circumstances of the crime. However, we can provide an estimate based on the population statistics given.

Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller (as opposed to 15% in the overall city), it might be reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than the city average.

However, it's also important to consider that this probability is not a direct reflection of the attacker's height, but rather a reflection of the height distribution in the neighborhood. The actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors not provided in the question.

That being said, based on the information given, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
