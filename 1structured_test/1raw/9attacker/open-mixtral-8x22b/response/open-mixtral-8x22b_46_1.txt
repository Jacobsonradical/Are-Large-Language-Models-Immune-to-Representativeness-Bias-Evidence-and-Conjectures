Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller depends on the population distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 80% of the people in that neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, it implies that 20% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that if we were to randomly select a person from the neighborhood, there would be a 20% chance that they are 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that this probability doesn't definitively identify the attacker's height. It merely provides a statistical estimate based on the available data. The actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors not mentioned in the question, such as the attacker's specific location within the neighborhood, their motive, or any other relevant circumstances.

That being said, based solely on the given information:

{probability: 0.2, or 20%}
