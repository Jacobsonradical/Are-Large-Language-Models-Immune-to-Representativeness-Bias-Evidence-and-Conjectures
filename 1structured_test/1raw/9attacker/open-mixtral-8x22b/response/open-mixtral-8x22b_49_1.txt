Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by using the data from the neighborhood in which the attack occurred. This is because the neighborhood data is more specific to the context of the attack.

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that there is a 0.2 probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the information provided. The actual probability could be different, as we don't have information about other factors that could influence the attacker's height, such as the attacker's age, gender, or other physical characteristics.

So, in the requested format: {probability: 0.2}
