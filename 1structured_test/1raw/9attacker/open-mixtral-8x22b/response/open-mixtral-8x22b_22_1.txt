Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would depend on whether we consider the attacker to be a random individual from the city or specifically from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

If we consider the attacker as a random individual from the city, the probability would be 0.15 (15%). However, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with a higher percentage of taller people, it might be more reasonable to assume that the attacker is from that neighborhood. In this case, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller would be 0.20 (20%).

Therefore, based on the given information, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}

This estimate assumes that the attacker is a random individual from the neighborhood where the attack occurred. If there are additional details about the attacker that suggest a different assumption, the probability estimate might need to be adjusted accordingly.
