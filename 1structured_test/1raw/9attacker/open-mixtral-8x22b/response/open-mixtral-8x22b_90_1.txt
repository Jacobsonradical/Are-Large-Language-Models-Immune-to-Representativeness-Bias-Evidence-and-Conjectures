Based on the given information, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller would depend on whether we assume the attacker is a random person from the city or specifically from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

If we assume that the attacker is a random person from the city, we would use the city's height distribution. In this case, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%).

If we assume that the attacker is from the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we would use the neighborhood's height distribution. In this case, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (20%).

Without further context, it's not clear which assumption to make, so I will provide both estimates.

Estimate 1 (city distribution): {probability: 0.15}

Estimate 2 (neighborhood distribution): {probability: 0.20}
