Based on the given information, we know that in the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion is higher, with 20% of the people being 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker was drawn from the population of this neighborhood rather than the city as a whole. Therefore, we should base our estimate on the statistics of the neighborhood rather than the city.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%. However, to answer in the requested format:

{probability: 0.20}
