Based on the information provided, we can see that the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller compared to the city as a whole. However, without any specific information about the attacker or the circumstances of the attack, it is not possible to definitively determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

That being said, we can make an educated guess based on the available information. Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we could estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker was in this height range. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and should not be taken as a definitive answer.
