Based on the information provided, the attacker's height is unknown, and the only data we have is the distribution of heights in the city and the specific neighborhood. Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it is reasonable to use the neighborhood's height distribution as a reference for estimating the attacker's height.

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is estimated that there is a 0.2 probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
