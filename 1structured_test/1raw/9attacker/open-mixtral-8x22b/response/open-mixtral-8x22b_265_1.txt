Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, it's important to note that this is an estimation, not a certainty.

In a general context (the whole city), the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller is 15%. However, the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where the proportion of taller people is higher than the city average (20% vs 15%).

Therefore, if we assume that the attacker is a resident of this neighborhood and that height is randomly distributed among the attackers (which may not be the case in reality), we can estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as 20%.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.2}
