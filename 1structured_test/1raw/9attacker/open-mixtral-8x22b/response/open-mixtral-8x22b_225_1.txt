Based on the information provided, we know that the attacker came from the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. However, we don't have any specific information about the attacker's height, so we can't definitively say that the attacker was in this taller group. But, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2, or 20%, based on the neighborhood's height distribution.

{probability: 0.2}
