Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would depend on the population distribution in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 80% of people in that neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, it means that 20% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that the attacker has a 20% chance of being 185 cm or taller. However, this is a rough estimate and doesn't take into account other factors such as the possibility of the attacker being from outside the neighborhood or the fact that taller people might be more likely to be identified and ruled out as suspects.
