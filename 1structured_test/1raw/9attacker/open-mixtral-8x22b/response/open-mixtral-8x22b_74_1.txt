Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that an attacker chosen randomly from that population would also have a 20% chance of being 185 cm or taller.

However, this is just an estimate based on the available data, and without more specific information about the attacker, we cannot make a definitive conclusion. Other factors, such as the attacker's age, gender, and ethnicity, could also influence their height, but we don't have that information in this case.

So, based on the information given, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
