Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate, as we don't have specific information about the attacker.

Given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller (compared to 15% in the city overall), it suggests that there might be a higher likelihood that the attacker was in this taller group.

However, we can't say for certain that the attacker was from this neighborhood or that they fit this height distribution. There are many factors that could influence the attacker's height, such as where they were visiting from, their individual height, etc.

That being said, if we were to use the neighborhood height distribution as a proxy for the attacker's height, we would estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as 0.20 (or 20%).

Final answer: {probability: 0.20}
