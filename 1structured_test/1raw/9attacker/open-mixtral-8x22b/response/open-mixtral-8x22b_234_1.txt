Based on the information provided, the height of the attacker is unknown, and we only have the distribution of heights in the city and the specific neighborhood. Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it would be reasonable to consider the height distribution of the neighborhood as more relevant to the case.

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is logical to use this percentage as an estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.20}
