Based on the information provided, we can't definitively say that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as height alone does not determine the likelihood of someone being an attacker. However, we can estimate the probability based on the given height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Without any other information, we can assume that any individual in that neighborhood, including the attacker, has a 20% chance of being 185 cm or taller.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
