Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being in this height range is also 20%, or 0.2.

However, it is important to note that this is an estimate based on the available data, and there may be other factors that could influence the actual probability. For example, if the attacker was wearing shoes with thick soles, they might appear taller than they actually are. Additionally, the height of the victim and other contextual factors could also affect the interpretation of the evidence.

Therefore, with the understanding that this is an estimate based on limited information, we can say:

{probability: 0.2}
