Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering both the general population statistics and the specific neighborhood statistics.

Given that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, we can infer that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where only 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, this suggests a higher proportion of taller individuals in that area compared to the city as a whole. Therefore, using the neighborhood statistics, we can estimate that there is a 20% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

This estimation assumes that the height of the attacker is solely dependent on the height distribution within the neighborhood. However, without additional information, such as eyewitness accounts or physical evidence, it is challenging to provide a more precise estimate.
