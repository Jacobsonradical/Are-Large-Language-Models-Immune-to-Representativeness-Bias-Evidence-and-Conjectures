Based on the information provided, we know that in the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, this percentage is higher, with 20% of the population being 185 cm or taller. Since the attacker was from this neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood's height distribution for our estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
