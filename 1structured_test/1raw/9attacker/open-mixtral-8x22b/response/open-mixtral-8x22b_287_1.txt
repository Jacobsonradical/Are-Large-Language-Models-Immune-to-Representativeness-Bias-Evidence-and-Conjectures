Based on the information provided, we can make the following estimates:

1. In the city, there is an 85% chance that a random person is shorter than 185 cm and a 15% chance that they are 185 cm or taller.
2. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, there is a higher concentration of taller individuals, with 80% being shorter than 185 cm and 20 % being 185 cm or taller.

Since the attacker was from the neighborhood where taller individuals are more prevalent (20% compared to the city's 15%), it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than the city's average. Therefore, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than 15%, but not necessarily as high as 20%, as that would imply that the attacker's height is solely determined by the neighborhood's distribution.

Given these considerations, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be closer to the neighborhood's distribution, but not exactly the same. Let's estimate it to be around 18%:

{probability: 0.18}
