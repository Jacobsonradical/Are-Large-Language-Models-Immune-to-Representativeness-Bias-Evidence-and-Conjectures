Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by looking at the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker has a 20% chance of being in that height range. However, this is just an estimate and does not guarantee that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
