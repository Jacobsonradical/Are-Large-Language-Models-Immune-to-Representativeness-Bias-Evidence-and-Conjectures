Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller would depend on the population distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, this could serve as an estimate for the probability that the attacker is of that height or taller, assuming that all heights are equally likely to commit the crime.

However, it's important to note that this is a simplification and the actual probability could be influenced by other factors not included in the information provided, such as the distribution of heights among potential suspects, or any other relevant evidence.

Given the information provided, the estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be 0.2.
