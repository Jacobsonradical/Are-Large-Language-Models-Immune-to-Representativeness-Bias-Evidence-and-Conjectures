Given the information, we can make an educated estimate based on the statistics provided. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate and not a definitive answer, as individual cases can vary greatly.

In the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion increases to 20%. Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, it might be reasonable to use the neighborhood's statistics for our estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be estimated as:

{probability: 0.20}

Again, this is an estimate based on the given statistics and assumes that height is randomly distributed among potential attackers in the neighborhood. It does not account for other factors that could influence the attacker's height, such as physical requirements for the attack.
