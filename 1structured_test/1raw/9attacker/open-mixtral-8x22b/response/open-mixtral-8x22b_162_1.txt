Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in both the general city population and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.

However, since the attacker's height is unknown and the only information we have is the distribution of heights in the population and the neighborhood, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about the attacker's height.

Nevertheless, we can use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred as a more specific reference. This is because, in the absence of specific information about the attacker, we can assume that the attacker is more likely to be from the neighborhood.

So, based on the fact that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that there is a 20% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.2}
