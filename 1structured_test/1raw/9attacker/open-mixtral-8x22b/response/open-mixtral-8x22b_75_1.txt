Based on the information provided, the general population of the city has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller. However, the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher percentage of taller people, with 20% being 185 cm or taller.

Since the attacker was not seen, we cannot definitively say that the attacker is from the same neighborhood. However, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker could be from the same neighborhood, given that the attack occurred there.

Therefore, considering the higher prevalence of taller people in the neighborhood, it would be more probable to estimate that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. However, this is still an estimation and not a certainty.

{probability: 0.20}

This probability estimate is based on the given data about the neighborhood and is not a definitive answer, as the actual height of the attacker is unknown.
