Based on the information provided, we can only use the population demographics as a reference for estimating the probability of the attacker's height. Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, we can assume that the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is also 20%.

However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and the actual probability could be different. Factors such as the attacker's age, gender, and ethnicity, which might affect their height, are not provided. Additionally, the attacker might not be a resident of the neighborhood.

So, strictly following the format:
{probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
