Based on the information provided, it appears that the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of individuals who are 185 cm or taller compared to the city as a whole. This suggests that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller might be higher than the city average.

However, it's important to note that this is an estimation based on population statistics, and it doesn't necessarily reflect the exact probability for the individual attacker. The actual probability could be influenced by various other factors not mentioned in the question, such as the attacker's specific motives, the victim's height, or any prior knowledge the victim might have about potential attackers.

Given these considerations, and strictly adhering to the format requested:

{probability: 0.20, this is an estimate based on the provided neighborhood statistics}

This means that based on the given data, there's a 20% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, this should be interpreted with caution as it's a statistical estimate and may not reflect the actual probability for the specific case.
