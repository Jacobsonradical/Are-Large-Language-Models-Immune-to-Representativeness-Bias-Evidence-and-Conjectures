Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is likely higher in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, compared to the city average. However, the exact probability cannot be definitively determined without more specific information about the attacker or the witnesses.

That being said, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as a reference to estimate the probability. If 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, then it's reasonable to estimate that there's a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Please note that this is a rough estimate and not a definitive answer, as other factors could influence the actual probability.
