Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the victim did not see the attacker's height. However, we can estimate the probability based on the population statistics.

In the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this percentage is higher at 20%. Since the attacker is likely to be from this neighborhood, it is reasonable to use the neighborhood statistics as a basis for our estimate.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
