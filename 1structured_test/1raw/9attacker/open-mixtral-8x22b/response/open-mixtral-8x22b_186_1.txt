Given that the attack occurred at night and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we cannot be certain about the attacker's height. However, we can make an estimate based on the available population statistics.

In the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, the attack occurred in a neighborhood where this proportion is higher, with 20% of the population being 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, it is reasonable to use the neighborhood's population statistics as the basis for our estimate. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2, or 20%.
