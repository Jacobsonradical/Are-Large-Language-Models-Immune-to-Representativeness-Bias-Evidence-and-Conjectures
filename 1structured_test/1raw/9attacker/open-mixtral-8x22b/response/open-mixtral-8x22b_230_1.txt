Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the neighborhood has a higher proportion of taller individuals (20%) compared to the city as a whole (15%), it's reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is more likely to fall within the taller range.

However, it's important to note that this estimation doesn't account for other factors that could influence the attacker's height, such as the specific demographics of individuals who commit such attacks or any other relevant characteristics of the attacker that might be available.

Based solely on the height distribution in the neighborhood, we can estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.2, assuming the attacker's height is a random variable following the height distribution of the neighborhood}
