Based on the information provided, it seems that the population in the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller people (20%) compared to the city as a whole (15%). However, without any specific evidence pointing to the attacker's height, we cannot definitively say that the attacker was taller than 185 cm.

That being said, if we were to make an educated guess based solely on the statistical data provided, we might estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller would be higher in this neighborhood compared to the city as a whole. But remember, this is just a statistical estimation, not a definitive conclusion.

{probability: 0.20, this is a statistical estimate based on the given data and does not account for any specific evidence about the attacker's height}
