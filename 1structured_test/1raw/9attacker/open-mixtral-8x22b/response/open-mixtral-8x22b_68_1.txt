Based on the information provided, we know that in the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller individuals, with 20% being 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, it would be reasonable to use the neighborhood's demographic data for our probability estimate. Therefore, we would estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
