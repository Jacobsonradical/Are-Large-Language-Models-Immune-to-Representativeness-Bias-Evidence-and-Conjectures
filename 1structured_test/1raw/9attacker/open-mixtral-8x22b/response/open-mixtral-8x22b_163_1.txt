Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by looking at the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Given that 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can infer that there is a higher likelihood that the attacker belongs to this taller group compared to the general population of the city, where only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that this estimate is based solely on the distribution of heights and does not account for other factors that may influence the probability, such as the specific circumstances of the attack, witness testimonies, or other evidence collected during the investigation.

That being said, based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be:

{probability: 0.2}
