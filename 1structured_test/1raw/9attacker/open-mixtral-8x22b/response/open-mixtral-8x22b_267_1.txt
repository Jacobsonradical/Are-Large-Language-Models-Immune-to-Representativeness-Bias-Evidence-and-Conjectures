Given the information, we can make an educated guess about the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, it is important to note that this is just an estimate and not a definitive answer.

The general population of the city has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller, while in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this percentage is higher at 20%. Since the attack took place in this neighborhood, it is reasonable to assume that the height distribution of the attacker might follow the neighborhood's height distribution more closely than the city's overall height distribution.

Therefore, based on the given information, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%).
