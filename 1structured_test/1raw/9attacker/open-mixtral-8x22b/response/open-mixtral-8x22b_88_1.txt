Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine the attacker's height. However, we can make an educated guess using the probabilities given for the city and the neighborhood.

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, versus 15% in the city as a whole, it's reasonable to assume that the probability is higher in this context. Therefore, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood percentage.

Keep in mind that this is a statistical estimate and not a definitive answer.
