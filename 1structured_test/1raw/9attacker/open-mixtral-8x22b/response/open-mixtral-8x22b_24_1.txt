Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to use this figure as an estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was in this range.

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the given data and does not account for other factors that could influence the attacker's height, such as the specific demographics of the attacker or any other relevant evidence.

So, the estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
