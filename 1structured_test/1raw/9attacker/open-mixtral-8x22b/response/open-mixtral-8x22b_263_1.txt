Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the local demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Given that 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker also has a 20% chance of being in this height range.

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the given data, and the actual probability could be different. Factors such as the specific time of the attack, the attacker's method, and other circumstantial evidence could influence the probability. But based strictly on the height statistics, here's the answer in the requested format:

{probability: 0.2}
