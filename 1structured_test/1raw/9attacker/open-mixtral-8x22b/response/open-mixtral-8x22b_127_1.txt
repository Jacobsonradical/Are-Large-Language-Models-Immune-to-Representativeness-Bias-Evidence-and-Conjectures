Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the city and the specific neighborhood. However, we must keep in mind that this is an estimation based on available data and does not guarantee the exact height of the attacker.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this percentage is higher at 20%. Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, it's reasonable to consider this local distribution of heights to be more relevant than the city's distribution.

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}

This means that there is a 20% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the given data.
