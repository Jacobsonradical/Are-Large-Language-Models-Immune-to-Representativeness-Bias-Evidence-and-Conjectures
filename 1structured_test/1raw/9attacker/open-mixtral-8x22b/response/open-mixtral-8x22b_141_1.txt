Given the information, we know that in the city at large, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion is higher, at 20%. Since the attacker was from this neighborhood, it would be more accurate to use this local statistic for our estimate.

Therefore, based on the given information, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2, which corresponds to 20%}
