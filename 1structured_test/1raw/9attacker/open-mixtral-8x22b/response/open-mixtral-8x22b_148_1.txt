Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that an attacker chosen at random from that neighborhood would have a 20% chance of being 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the statistics provided, and there could be other factors that affect the probability, such as the attacker's motivations, opportunity, and other characteristics. But based solely on the height distribution, the probability estimate would be:

{probability: 0.20}
