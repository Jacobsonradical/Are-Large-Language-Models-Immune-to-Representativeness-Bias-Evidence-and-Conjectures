Given the information, we can use the data from the neighborhood as a more specific reference for estimating the probability of the attacker's height. The reasoning behind this is that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, and the characteristics of the neighborhood population might have influenced the likelihood of who the attacker was.

According to the information provided, 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, if we assume that the attacker was randomly selected from the neighborhood population, we can estimate that there is a 0.2 probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

However, it's essential to note that this is an estimate based on the limited information provided, and other factors could influence the attacker's height, such as the specific characteristics of the attack or the attacker's motives.

Based on the given information and the reasoning above, I estimate the probability as follows:
{probability: 0.2}
