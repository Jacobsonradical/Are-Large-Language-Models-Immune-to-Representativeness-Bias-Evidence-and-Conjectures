Given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, and without any other specific information about the attacker, it is reasonable to use this statistic as the estimate for the attacker's height.

However, it is important to note that this is just an estimate and not a definitive answer. It is based on the available data and assumes that the attacker's height is a random variable that follows the same distribution as the general population in that neighborhood.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.20}
