Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller depends on the population distribution in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, this could serve as an estimate for the probability that the attacker was of this height or taller, assuming that the attacker was a random individual from that neighborhood.

However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and actual probability could be different. For instance, the attacker might not be a resident of the neighborhood, or certain height groups might be more likely to commit such crimes, altering the probability.

That being said, following the provided format:

{probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
