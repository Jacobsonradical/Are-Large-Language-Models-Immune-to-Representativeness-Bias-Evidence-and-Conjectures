Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be higher in the neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the city's overall population.

In the city, there is a 15% chance that a person is 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood, this probability increases to 20%.

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it's reasonable to use the neighborhood's population statistics as the basis for our estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.20}
