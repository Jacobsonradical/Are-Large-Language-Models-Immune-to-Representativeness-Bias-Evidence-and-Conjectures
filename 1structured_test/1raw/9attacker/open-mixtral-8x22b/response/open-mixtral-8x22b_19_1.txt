Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to estimate that there's a 20% probability that the attacker was in this height range.

However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and not a definitive probability. The actual probability could be influenced by other factors not mentioned in the question, such as the specific habits, presence, and characteristics of individuals in the neighborhood.
