Based on the information provided, the height of the attacker is unknown and we only have statistical data about the general population and the specific neighborhood. Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it would be reasonable to assume that the attacker's height follows the same distribution.

However, it's important to note that this is an estimate and not a certainty, as the attacker's height could still fall into the shorter category. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This means there's a 20% chance or 1 in 5 probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the statistics of the neighborhood.
