Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being of that height or taller is also 20%. However, this estimate assumes that the attacker's height is a random variable with the same distribution as the height distribution in the neighborhood, which may not be the case.

Answer: {probability: 0.2}
