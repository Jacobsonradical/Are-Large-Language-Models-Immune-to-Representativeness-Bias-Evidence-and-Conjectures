Given the information, there are no specific details about the attacker other than the general height distribution in the city and the neighborhood. Therefore, we can only estimate the probability based on the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to estimate that there's a 20% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

However, this is a rough estimate and should be treated with caution, as it does not take into account any other factors that might influence the attacker's height, such as the nature of the attack, the victim's height, or any other details about the crime.
