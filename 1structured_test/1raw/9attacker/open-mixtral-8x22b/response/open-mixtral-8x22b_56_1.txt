Given that the attacker's height is unknown and the only information available is the height distribution of the population, we can use this data to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

In the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This suggests that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher in this neighborhood than in the city as a whole.

However, it's important to note that this is just a statistical probability and not a guarantee. The actual height of the attacker could be different.

That being said, the best estimate we can make based on the given information is the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
