Given the information, we can't definitively determine the attacker's height. However, we can make an educated guess based on the population statistics for the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

The city's population as a whole has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller. However, the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher percentage of taller individuals, with 20% of the population being 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it would be reasonable to use the neighborhood's statistics as a basis for estimating the attacker's height. Therefore, we could estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.20}
