Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine the height of the attacker. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the given probabilities.

In the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this percentage is higher, at 20%. Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it may be more likely that the attacker was a resident of this neighborhood. Therefore, we might estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood statistic of 20%, or 0.20 in decimal form.

However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate, not a certainty. The actual probability could be different, depending on other factors not included in this information.

So, my estimate of the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
