Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the population distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can use this as our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height falls into that range.

However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on the available data and assumes that the height of the attacker is randomly distributed according to the height distribution in the neighborhood. Other factors, such as witness descriptions or physical evidence, could potentially influence the estimate.

That being said, following the requested format, here's the estimated probability:

{probability: 0.2}
