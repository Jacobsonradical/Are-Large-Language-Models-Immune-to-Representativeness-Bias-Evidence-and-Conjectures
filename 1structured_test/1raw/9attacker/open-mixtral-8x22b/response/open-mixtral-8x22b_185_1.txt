Based on the information provided, it's important to note that we don't have any specific information about the attacker other than the fact that the incident occurred in a neighborhood with a higher percentage of taller individuals compared to the city's average.

Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that there's a 20% chance that a random individual from this neighborhood would be 185 cm or taller.

However, this doesn't mean that the attacker is necessarily one of these taller individuals. It's a probability estimate based on the demographics of the neighborhood, not a definitive identification of the attacker's height.

Therefore, the probability estimate that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
