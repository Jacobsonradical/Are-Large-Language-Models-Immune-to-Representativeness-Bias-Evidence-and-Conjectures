To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the given information about the heights of people in the city and in the specific neighborhood.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller (more than the city's average of 15%), it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than the city's average.

However, we don't have any specific information about the attacker, such as their gender, age, or ethnicity, which could potentially influence their height. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact probability.

Given the information available, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.
