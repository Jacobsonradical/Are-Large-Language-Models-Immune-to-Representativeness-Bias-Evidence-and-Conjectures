Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Given that 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, this percentage could serve as an estimate for the probability that the attacker was of this height or taller.

However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and not a definitive probability. The actual probability could be influenced by other factors not mentioned in the question, such as the attacker's gender, age, or any specific characteristics that might make them more or less likely to be taller than 185 cm.

That being said, based on the information given:

{probability: 0.2, or 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller}
