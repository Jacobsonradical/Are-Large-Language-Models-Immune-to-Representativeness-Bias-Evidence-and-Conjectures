Given the information, we can't definitively determine the attacker's height since the victim did not see the attacker. However, we can make an educated guess based on the statistics provided.

In the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this number is higher at 20%.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it may be more likely that the attacker came from that area. Therefore, we might estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than the city average, but lower than the neighborhood average, since we don't know for certain that the attacker is a resident of that neighborhood.

A conservative estimate might be the average of the city and neighborhood percentages for people 185 cm or taller, which would be (15% + 20%) / 2 = 17.5%.

However, this is just an estimate and the actual probability could be different. It's also important to note that height is not the only factor in identifying a suspect, and other evidence would be needed to make a definitive identification.

Final answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.175}
