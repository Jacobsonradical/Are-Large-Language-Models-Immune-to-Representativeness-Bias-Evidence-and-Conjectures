Based on the information provided, the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is more probable in the neighborhood where the attack occurred (20%) than in the city as a whole (15%). However, we don't have any specific information about the attacker or any factors that might make it more likely for the attacker to be in the taller range.

Given this, it seems reasonable to use the neighborhood's height distribution as the basis for our estimate, as it is more specific to the location of the attack. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.20}

This estimate assumes that the attacker is a random individual from the neighborhood population, which might not be the case if there are other relevant factors we're not aware of.
