Based on the information provided, the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller depends on the height distribution of the population in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and does not account for other factors that could influence the attacker's height, such as the height distribution among potential suspects or any available physical evidence.
