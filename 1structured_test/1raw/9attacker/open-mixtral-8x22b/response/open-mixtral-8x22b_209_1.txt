Given that the attack occurred at night and the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can't make a definitive conclusion about the attacker's height. However, we can use the given probabilities to make an estimate.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this probability increases to 20%. Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is more likely to follow the neighborhood's distribution.

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.20}
