Based on the information provided, the overall population of the city and the specific neighborhood have different height distributions. However, without any specific evidence linking the attacker's height to the height distribution of the neighborhood, we cannot definitively say that the attacker's height is more likely to be within the neighborhood's height distribution.

Nevertheless, if we were to make an educated guess based solely on the neighborhood's height distribution, we could estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20%, as this reflects the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

That being said, this is a very rough estimate and may not reflect the actual probability. The actual probability could be lower or higher depending on various factors, such as the attacker's motive, the victim's height, and any other evidence that may be available.
