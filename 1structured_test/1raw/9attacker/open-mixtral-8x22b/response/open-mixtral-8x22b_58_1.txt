Based on the information provided, the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the neighborhood where the attack occurred than in the city as a whole. This is because 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, compared to only 15% in the city.

However, we must remember that these statistics are about the population in general, not about criminals specifically. Without more information about the attacker, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about their height.

That being said, if we had to make an estimate based on the given data, we could say that the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is higher in the neighborhood than in the city. So, our estimate would be:

{probability: 0.20, based on the neighborhood statistics}
