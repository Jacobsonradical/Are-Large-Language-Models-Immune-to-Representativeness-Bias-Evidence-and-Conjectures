Based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to use the neighborhood's height distribution as a more specific reference for estimating the attacker's height. This is because the attack occurred in that neighborhood, and the height distribution there is different from the city as a whole.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, if we assume that the attacker's height is randomly distributed according to the neighborhood's height distribution, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

This is a rough estimate and does not take into account other factors that could influence the attacker's height, such as any descriptions provided by the victim or other witnesses, or any other evidence discovered during the investigation.

So, in the format requested:
{probability: 0.20}
