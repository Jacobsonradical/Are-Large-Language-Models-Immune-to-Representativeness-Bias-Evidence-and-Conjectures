Based on the information provided, the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller depends on the population distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to infer that there is a 0.2 probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
