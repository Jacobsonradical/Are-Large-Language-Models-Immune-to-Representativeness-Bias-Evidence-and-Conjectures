Given the information, we know that in the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, that proportion is higher at 20%.

Since the crime took place in this neighborhood and we have no further information about the attacker's height, it's reasonable to use the neighborhood's height distribution for our probability estimate.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}

This estimate assumes that height is not related to the likelihood of committing a crime, and that the attacker was a random individual from the neighborhood. If there were reason to believe that taller people were more likely to commit such a crime, or if there were some other reason to suspect a certain height, our estimate might be different. But based on the information given, 0.20 is a reasonable estimate.
