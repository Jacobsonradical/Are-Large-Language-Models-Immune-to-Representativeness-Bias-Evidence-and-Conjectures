Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine the height of the attacker. However, we can use the given statistics to make an estimate. Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is also 20%. This assumes that the attacker was a random individual from the neighborhood and not specifically selected based on height.

{probability: 0.2}
