Based on the information provided, the general population of the city has a 15% chance that a random individual is 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this probability increases to 20%. Since the attacker was not seen, we can only make an estimate based on the demographics of the neighborhood.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
