Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the population distribution in the city and the specific neighborhood.

1. In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. In the specific neighborhood, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it would make sense to use the neighborhood's population distribution to estimate the probability of the attacker's height. However, we should also consider the city's distribution, as it provides a broader context.

To balance these two pieces of information, we could take a weighted average of the city and neighborhood distributions. However, since we don't have the exact weights, we'll provide a range of probabilities based on the city and neighborhood distributions.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is likely to be between 15% (city distribution) and 20% (neighborhood distribution).

{probability: between 0.15 and 0.20}
