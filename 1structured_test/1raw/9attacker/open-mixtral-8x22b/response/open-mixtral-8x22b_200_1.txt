Based on the given information, we cannot definitively say that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the victim did not see the attacker's height. However, we can make an estimate based on the statistics of the population in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood, this proportion increases to 20%. Given that the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it is reasonable to use the neighborhood statistics as the basis for our estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

0.20 (or 20% when expressed as a percentage)

So, in the requested format:

{probability: 0.20}
