Given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, compared to the city-wide statistic of 15%, we can infer that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher in this neighborhood.

However, we don't know the exact distribution of heights within the taller group (185 cm or taller), nor do we know if the attacker is a resident of the neighborhood or just passing through. We also don't have any other distinguishing features or evidence to help narrow down the suspect pool.

Therefore, based on the given information, the most reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are of that height or taller, which is 20%, or 0.2 in probability terms.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.2}
