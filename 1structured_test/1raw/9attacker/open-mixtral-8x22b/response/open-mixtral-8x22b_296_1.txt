Based on the information provided, the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the general population of the city. This is because a higher proportion of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city as a whole (15%).

However, without specific information about the attacker or the circumstances of the attack, we cannot definitively say that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We can only say that there is a higher probability in this neighborhood.

So, the probability estimate would be:

{probability: 0.20}

This means that there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
