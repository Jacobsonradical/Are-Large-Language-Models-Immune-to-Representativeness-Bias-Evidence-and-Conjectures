Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller using the neighborhood statistics, as that is the most specific information we have about the location of the attack.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that there is a 0.2 probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and the actual probability could be different. Factors such as the attacker's age, gender, or ethnicity, which were not provided, could also affect the probability.

So, in the requested format:
{probability: 0.2}
