Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be higher in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the overall city population. This is because the percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller is 20% in the neighborhood, while it is only 15% in the overall city population.

However, it's important to note that this doesn't definitively prove that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. It simply means that the likelihood is higher in this neighborhood compared to the city as a whole.

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.20}
