Given the information, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller would depend on the specific neighborhood's population height distribution rather than the entire city's distribution. This is because the crime occurred in a specific neighborhood, and it's reasonable to assume that the attacker is from that neighborhood.

In this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
