Based on the information provided, we can determine that the general population of the city has a higher percentage of people who are shorter than 185 cm (85%) compared to the neighborhood where the attack occurred (80%). This means that there is a higher proportion of taller individuals in the neighborhood than in the city as a whole.

However, the information provided does not give us any specific details about the attacker's height or any other relevant characteristics. Therefore, we can only make an estimate based on the population distribution in the neighborhood.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be equal to the proportion of individuals in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, this proportion is 20%.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
