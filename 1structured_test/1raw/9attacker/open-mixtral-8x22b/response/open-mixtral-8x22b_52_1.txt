Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be higher in the neighborhood where the crime occurred than in the city as a whole. However, we don't have any specific information about the attacker, so we can only use the general population statistics as an estimate.

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is in this group would be 0.2. This is just an estimate based on the available data and assumes that the attacker was a random individual from the neighborhood population.

{probability: 0.2}
