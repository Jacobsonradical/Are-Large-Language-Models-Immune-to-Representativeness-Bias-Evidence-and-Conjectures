Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be higher in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the general population of the city.

In the city, there is a 15% chance that a person is 185 cm or taller. However, in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, this probability increases to 20%.

Since we don't have any additional information about the attacker, we can only base our estimate on the general height distribution of the population in that neighborhood.

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
