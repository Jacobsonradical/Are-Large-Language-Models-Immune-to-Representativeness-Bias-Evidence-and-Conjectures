Based on the information provided, we can't definitively say that the attacker was taller than 185 cm. However, we can estimate the probability based on the given statistics.

The fact that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, as opposed to the citywide average of 15%, suggests that there might be a slightly higher probability that the attacker was in this height range.

However, it's important to note that this doesn't necessarily mean the attacker was taller than 185 cm. The height of the attacker would depend on many factors, including the specific circumstances of the attack and the height of the victim.

That being said, based purely on the statistics provided, we could estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as follows:

{probability: 0.2, this is based on the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller}

This estimate assumes that the height of the attacker is randomly distributed according to the height distribution of the neighborhood population, which might not be the case in reality.
