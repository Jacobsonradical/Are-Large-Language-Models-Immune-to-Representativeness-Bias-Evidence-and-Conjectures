Based on the information provided, the general population of the city has a 15% probability of being 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this probability increases to 20%.

Given that the attacker's height is unknown and there is no other specific information to narrow down the suspects, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker could be any person from that neighborhood. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.20}

This estimation is based on the available information and the assumption that the attacker is a random person from the neighborhood. If additional information is provided, such as witness descriptions or specific suspects, this probability could change.
