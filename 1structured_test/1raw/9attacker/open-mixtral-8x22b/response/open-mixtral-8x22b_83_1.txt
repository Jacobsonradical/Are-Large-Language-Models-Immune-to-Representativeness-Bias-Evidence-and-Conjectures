Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as we do not have any direct evidence about the attacker's height. However, we can make an educated guess based on the population statistics given.

The overall population of the city has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller. However, the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller people, with 20% being 185 cm or taller. Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it may be reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is more likely to be representative of this local population than the overall city population.

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be based on the local population statistics.

{probability: 0.2}

Again, this is an estimate based on the given information and not a definitive answer.
