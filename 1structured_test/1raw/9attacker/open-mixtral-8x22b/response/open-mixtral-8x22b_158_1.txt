Based on the information provided, it seems that the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the city as a whole. However, without any other specific information about the attacker, we can only make an estimate based on the population statistics.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, which is higher than the city average of 15%. Therefore, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is higher than the city average but does not exceed 20% because we don't have any specific information about the attacker.

So, my estimate is:
{probability: 0.20}

This means that there is a 20% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the population statistics of the neighborhood.
