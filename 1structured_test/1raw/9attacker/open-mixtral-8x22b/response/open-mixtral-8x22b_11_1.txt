Based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to use the height distribution of the neighborhood as a proxy for estimating the probability of the attacker's height. Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is also 20%, or 0.2 when expressed as a number between 0 and 1.

{probability: 0.2}
