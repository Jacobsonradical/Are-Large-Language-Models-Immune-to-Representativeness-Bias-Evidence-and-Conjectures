Given the information, we can only make an estimate based on the population statistics of the city and the specific neighborhood. We don't have any other specific evidence about the attacker's height.

In the city, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion is higher at 20%.

Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, it might be reasonable to assume that the attacker's height follows the distribution of the neighborhood, rather than the city as a whole.

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the given data, is 0.2 (or 20%).
