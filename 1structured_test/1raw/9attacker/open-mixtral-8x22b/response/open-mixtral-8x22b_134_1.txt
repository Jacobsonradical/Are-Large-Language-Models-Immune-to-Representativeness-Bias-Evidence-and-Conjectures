Given the information provided, we can make an educated guess about the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and not a definitive answer.

The city's overall population statistics suggest that 15% of people are 185 cm or taller. However, the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller individuals, with 20% being 185 cm or taller.

If we assume that the attacker is a resident of the neighborhood (which is a reasonable assumption given the context), then we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is approximately 20%.

However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and not a definitive answer. The actual probability could be lower or higher depending on other factors not considered here, such as the specific time of the attack, the attacker's motives, and any other relevant information.

Here's the format you asked for:
