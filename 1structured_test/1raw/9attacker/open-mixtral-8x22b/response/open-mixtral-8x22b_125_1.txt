Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is higher in the neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the city as a whole. In the neighborhood, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller, compared to 15% in the entire city. However, since the attacker's height is unknown and there is no specific evidence to suggest the attacker was taller than 185 cm, we cannot definitively say that the attacker was taller. But based on the neighborhood statistics, we can estimate a higher likelihood.
