Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller would be influenced by both the general population statistics and the neighborhood statistics. However, since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, the neighborhood statistics would likely be more relevant. Therefore, we would estimate the probability based on the neighborhood statistics.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.20, this is based on the fact that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller}
