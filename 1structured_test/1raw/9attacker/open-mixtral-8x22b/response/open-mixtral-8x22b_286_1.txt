Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that any given individual from that neighborhood, including the attacker, has a 20% chance of being 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that this is an estimate and not a certainty. The actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors not mentioned in the question, such as any additional information about the attacker or specific characteristics of the victim that might influence the height of the attacker.

Given the information provided, the estimated probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
