Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being in this height range is also 20%, or 0.2.

However, it's important to note that this is an estimate and not a certainty. The actual probability could be different, as we don't have information about other factors that could influence the attacker's height, such as the victim's height or the specific circumstances of the attack.

That being said, based on the information provided:

{probability: 0.2}
