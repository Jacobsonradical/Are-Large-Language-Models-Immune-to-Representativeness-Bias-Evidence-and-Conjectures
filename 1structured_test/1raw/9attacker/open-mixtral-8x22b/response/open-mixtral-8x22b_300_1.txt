Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would depend on the specific distribution of heights within the neighborhood where the attack occurred. However, since we only have the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood (20%), we can use this as our estimate.

This does not consider other factors that might affect the probability, such as any specific characteristics or behaviors of the attacker that might make them more or less likely to be of a certain height. Nonetheless, based on the given data, we can make an estimate.
