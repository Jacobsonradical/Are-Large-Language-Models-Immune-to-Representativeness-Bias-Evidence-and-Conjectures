Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to use this as an estimate for the probability that the attacker falls into this height range.

However, it's important to note that this estimation assumes that the attacker was a random individual from the neighborhood. In reality, the attacker's height could deviate from this estimate, especially if the attacker had specific reasons for targeting the victim.
