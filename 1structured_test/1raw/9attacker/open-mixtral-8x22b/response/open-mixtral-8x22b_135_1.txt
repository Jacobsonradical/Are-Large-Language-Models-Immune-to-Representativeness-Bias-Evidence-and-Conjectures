Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would depend on the specific neighborhood statistics rather than the citywide statistics, as the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood. Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller would also be 0.2, or 20%.

However, this is a rough estimate based on the given data and does not take into account other factors that could affect the probability, such as the possibility that taller individuals might be more or less likely to commit such crimes, or that the attacker might not be a resident of the neighborhood.
