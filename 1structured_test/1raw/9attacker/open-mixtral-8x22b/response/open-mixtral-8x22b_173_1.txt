Based on the information provided, we can't definitively say that the attacker was one height or another. However, we can use the given data to make an educated estimate.

Given that the city's population has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller, and the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher percentage (20%) of people who are 185 cm or taller, we might infer that there is a slightly higher probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller than if we were considering the city's population as a whole.

However, it's important to note that this doesn't definitively mean the attacker was 185 cm or taller. It just means that there is a higher proportion of people that height or taller in the neighborhood.

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the data, would be:

{probability: 0.20}

This is still a rough estimate and the actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors not provided in the scenario.
