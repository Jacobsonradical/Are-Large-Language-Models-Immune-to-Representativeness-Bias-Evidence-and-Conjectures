Based on the information provided, the general population of the city has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion increases to 20%. Since the attacker was not identified, and considering the higher proportion of taller people in the neighborhood, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood distribution. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20, or 20%.
