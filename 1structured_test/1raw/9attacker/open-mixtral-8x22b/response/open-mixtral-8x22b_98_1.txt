Based on the information provided, it appears that the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the city as a whole. However, without any other information about the attacker or specific clues that might suggest their height, we can only base our estimate on the general height distribution in the neighborhood.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based solely on this information, we might estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be:

{probability: 0.2}

This is a rough estimate and the actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors not mentioned in the question.
