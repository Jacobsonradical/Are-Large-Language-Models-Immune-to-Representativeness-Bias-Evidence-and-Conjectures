Given the information, we can't definitively say that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the victim did not see the attacker's height. However, we can estimate the probability based on the population statistics.

In the city as a whole, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion increases to 20%. This suggests that taller individuals might be overrepresented in this neighborhood.

Since the attacker was present in this neighborhood, it might be reasonable to use the neighborhood's height distribution to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.2, or 20%.
