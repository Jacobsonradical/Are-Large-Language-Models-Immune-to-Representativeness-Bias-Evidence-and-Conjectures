Based on the information given, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would depend on the population specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the neighborhood has a higher proportion of taller individuals (20%) compared to the city average (15%), it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than the city average.

However, without additional information about the attacker or the distribution of heights specifically for individuals who commit such attacks, we can only estimate based on the general height distribution of the neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability estimate that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
