Based on the information provided, the general population of the city has a higher percentage of individuals who are shorter than 185 cm (85%) compared to the neighborhood where the attack occurred (80%). This suggests that the neighborhood has a relatively higher proportion of taller individuals (185 cm or taller) than the city as a whole.

Since the attacker's height is unknown, and the victim could not see the attacker, we cannot definitively determine the attacker's height. However, we can use the given probabilities as a basis for estimation.

Given that the neighborhood has a higher percentage of taller individuals (20%) than the city as a whole (15%), it could be reasonable to assume that there is a higher probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the demographics of the neighborhood.

That being said, this is an estimate based on statistical likelihood and does not guarantee the actual height of the attacker.

{probability: 0.20}

This means that based on the given data, there is a 20% probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
