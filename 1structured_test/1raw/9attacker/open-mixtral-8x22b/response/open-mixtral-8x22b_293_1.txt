Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. The fact that the attack happened at night and from behind, preventing the victim from seeing the attacker's height, means we can only rely on the statistical data.

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, this could serve as our initial estimate for the probability that the attacker was in this height range. However, it's essential to acknowledge that this is an approximation, as individual factors could influence the actual probability.

That being said, strictly adhering to the requested format:

{probability: 0.2, as this is the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the height distribution in the neighborhood}
