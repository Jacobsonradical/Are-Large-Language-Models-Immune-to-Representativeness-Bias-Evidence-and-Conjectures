Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by using the statistics from the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This is because the neighborhood statistics are more specific to the circumstances of the attack.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2, based on the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

However, it's important to note that this is an estimation based on the given data. The actual probability could vary depending on other factors not mentioned in the prompt, such as the height distribution among potential suspects, or other evidence that might influence the probability.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.2}
