Given the information, we don't have any specific details about the attacker other than the general height distribution in the city and the neighborhood. Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it might be reasonable to assume that the attacker is from the same area.

If we use the neighborhood height distribution as our prior, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.

However, this is a very rough estimate and doesn't take into account any other factors that might be relevant, such as the victim's height, the nature of the attack, or any other evidence the police might have found.
