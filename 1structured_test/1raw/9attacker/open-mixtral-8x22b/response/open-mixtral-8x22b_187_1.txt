Based on the information provided, we know that in the city, the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. However, we are also given information about the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, which suggests a different distribution of heights. In this neighborhood, the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

Since the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood and we have no further information about the attacker, it would be reasonable to assume that the attacker's height follows the height distribution of the neighborhood.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
