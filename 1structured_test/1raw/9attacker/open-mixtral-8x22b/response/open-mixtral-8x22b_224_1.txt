Based on the given information, it seems that the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the city as a whole. However, without any specific evidence linking the attack to taller individuals, we can only use the population statistics as an estimate.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood is 20%, as given by the data. This is higher than the citywide probability of 15%. However, without more specific information, we cannot definitively say that the attacker is more likely to be in the taller group.

So, based on the given data and for the sake of this estimation, we can say that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%. But to answer in the required format:

{probability: 0.2}
