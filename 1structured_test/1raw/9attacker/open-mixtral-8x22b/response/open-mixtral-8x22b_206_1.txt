Based on the information given, it appears that the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the overall city population. However, without any other details about the attacker or the attack, we cannot definitively say that the attacker was more likely to be 185 cm or taller.

That being said, if we were to make an educated guess based solely on the height statistics of the neighborhood, we could estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than the city average, which was 15%. Since 20% of the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to use this figure as our estimate.

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.2}
