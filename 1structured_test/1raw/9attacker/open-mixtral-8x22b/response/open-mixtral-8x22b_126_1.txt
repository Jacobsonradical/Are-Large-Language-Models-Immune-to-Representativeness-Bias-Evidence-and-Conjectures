Based on the information provided, it seems that the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the city as a whole. However, we don't have specific information about the attacker, so we can't definitively say whether the attacker is among the taller portion of the population.

Given the higher concentration of taller individuals (20%) in the neighborhood compared to the city average (15%), it might be reasonable to adjust our estimate of the attacker's height probability accordingly. However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and not a guarantee.

Here's the estimate in the requested format:
{probability: 0.20, this is based on the given distribution of heights in the neighborhood}
