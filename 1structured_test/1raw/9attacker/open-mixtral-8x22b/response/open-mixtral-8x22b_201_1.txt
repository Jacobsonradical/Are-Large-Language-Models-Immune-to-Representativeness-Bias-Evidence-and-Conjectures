Based on the information provided, the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the city as a whole. This is because 20% of the neighborhood population is 185 cm or taller, compared to 15% in the entire city.

However, it's important to note that this does not definitively prove that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. It simply means that, given the available data, a person chosen at random from this neighborhood has a higher probability of being 185 cm or taller than a person chosen at random from the city.

Given this information, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is based on the fact that 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller. However, this is a rough estimate and the actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors not provided in the question.
