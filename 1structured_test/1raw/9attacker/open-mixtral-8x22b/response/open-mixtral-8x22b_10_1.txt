Given the information, it's important to note that we cannot definitively determine the attacker's height based on this data alone. However, we can make an estimation based on the probabilities given.

Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to use this probability as a starting point for our estimation. This probability is based on the specific demographics of the neighborhood, which could potentially be more relevant than the city-wide statistics if the attacker is a resident of the same neighborhood.

Therefore, our estimation for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}

This estimation assumes that the height of the attacker is a random variable, independent of the act of committing the crime, and that the attacker is a resident of the neighborhood. If there are additional details or context, the estimation could change.
