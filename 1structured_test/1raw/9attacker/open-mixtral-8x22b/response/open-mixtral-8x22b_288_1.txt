Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the local demographics. Since 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, it means that 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Given that the attack occurred in this neighborhood, and assuming that the attacker is one of the residents, we can infer that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.

{probability: 0.2}
