Based on the information provided, we can see that the neighborhood demographic for height slightly differs from the overall city demographic. In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, while in the neighborhood the proportion is higher at 20%.

Given that the attacker's height could not be determined, and using the available data, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood demographic.

{probability: 0.20}

This means there's a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the neighborhood demographic. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate, and the actual probability could be different depending on other unknown factors.
