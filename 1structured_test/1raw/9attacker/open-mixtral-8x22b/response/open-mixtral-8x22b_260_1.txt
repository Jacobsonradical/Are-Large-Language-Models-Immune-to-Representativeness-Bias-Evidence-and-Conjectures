Given the information, we can't definitively say that the attacker was 185 cm or taller with absolute certainty since the victim did not see the attacker. However, we can estimate the probability based on the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that there is a 0.2 probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This is based on the assumption that height is not a factor that influences the likelihood of someone committing a crime.
