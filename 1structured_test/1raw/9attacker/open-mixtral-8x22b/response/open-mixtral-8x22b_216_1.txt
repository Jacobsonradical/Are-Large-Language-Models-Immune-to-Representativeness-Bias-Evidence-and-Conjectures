Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be higher in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the city as a whole. This is due to the higher percentage of taller individuals (20%) living in the neighborhood versus the city (15%).

However, it's important to note that we don't have any other information about the attacker, such as whether they are a resident of this neighborhood or not. We also don't know if the attacker's height is correlated with committing such crimes.

Given the data we have, we can only make a rough estimate based on the height distribution in the relevant neighborhood. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.20 (or 20%).
