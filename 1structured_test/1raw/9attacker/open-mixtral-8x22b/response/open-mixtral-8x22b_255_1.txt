Based on the information provided, we can make an educated estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate and not a definitive answer.

Given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller (compared to 15% in the city as a whole), it's reasonable to assume that the likelihood of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher in this neighborhood.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
