Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This is because the local distribution of heights is likely to be more relevant than the distribution across the entire city.

In this case, 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Without any other specific information about the attacker, we would use this statistic as our best estimate of the probability.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
