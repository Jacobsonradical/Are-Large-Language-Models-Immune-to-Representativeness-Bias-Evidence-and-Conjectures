Based on the information provided, the attacker's height could not be determined directly. However, we can make an educated guess based on the statistics of the neighborhood in which the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that there is a 20% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
