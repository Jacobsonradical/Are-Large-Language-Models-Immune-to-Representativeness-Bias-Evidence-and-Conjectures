Based on the given information, it's not possible to determine the exact probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, we can make an estimate using the available data.

Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can use this as a starting point for our estimate. However, this probability assumes that all heights in the neighborhood are equally likely to be the attacker, which may not be the case.

Additionally, we don't know if the attacker is a resident of the neighborhood or not. If the attacker is not a resident, then the probability could be different.

Therefore, considering the available information and the limitations of our knowledge, we can estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.2, this is just an estimate and the actual probability could be different}
