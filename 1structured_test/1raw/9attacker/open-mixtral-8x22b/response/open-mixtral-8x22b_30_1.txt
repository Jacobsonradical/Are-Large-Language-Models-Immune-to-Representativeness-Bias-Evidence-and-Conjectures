Based on the information provided, the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller would depend on the population demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 80% of the people in this neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, it implies that 20% are 185 cm or taller.

This information is more specific and relevant than the city-wide statistics, as it pertains directly to the location of the crime. Therefore, assuming there is no additional information about the attacker, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.20}
