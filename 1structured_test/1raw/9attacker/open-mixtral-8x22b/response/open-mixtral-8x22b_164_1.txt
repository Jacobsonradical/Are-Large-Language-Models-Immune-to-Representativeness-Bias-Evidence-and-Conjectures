Based on the information provided, the overall population of the city has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion is higher, with 20% of people being 185 cm or taller. Since the attacker was not identified, we cannot definitively say that they are taller than 185 cm. However, based on the neighborhood statistics, there is a higher likelihood that the attacker is 185 cm or taller compared to the city's general population. Therefore, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.20}
