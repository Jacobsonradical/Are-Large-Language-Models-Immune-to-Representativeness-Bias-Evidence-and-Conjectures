In this case, we don't have any specific information about the attacker other than the general height distribution of the population and the neighborhood where the attack occurred. If we assume that the attacker was randomly selected from the population of the neighborhood, we could use the neighborhood's height distribution as the basis for our estimate.

The fact that the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution than the city as a whole suggests that the neighborhood's height distribution might be more relevant to our estimate. However, without more specific information, we can't completely rule out the possibility that someone from outside the neighborhood was the attacker.

Given these considerations, it seems reasonable to base our estimate primarily on the neighborhood's height distribution, while acknowledging that the citywide distribution might also have some influence. Therefore, I would estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller to be somewhat higher than the citywide average, but lower than the neighborhood average.

Here's a simple way to combine these two pieces of information: we could take a weighted average of the citywide and neighborhood probabilities, with more weight given to the neighborhood probability since it seems more directly relevant. For example, we might use a weight of 0.75 for the neighborhood probability and 0.25 for the citywide probability, resulting in an estimated probability of:

0.75 * 0.20 + 0.25 * 0.15 = 0.1875

So my estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller would be 0.1875.

{probability: 0.1875}
