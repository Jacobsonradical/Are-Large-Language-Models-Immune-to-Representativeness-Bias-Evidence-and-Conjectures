Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the relevant population.

In this case, we have the height distribution for the entire city, as well as the height distribution for the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood, it would be more appropriate to consider the height distribution of that neighborhood rather than the entire city.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.2}
