To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the specific neighborhood distribution.

The overall city population data suggests that 15% of the people are 185 cm or taller. However, the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller people, with 20% being 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, it would be more appropriate to use the neighborhood's height distribution for our estimate. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).
