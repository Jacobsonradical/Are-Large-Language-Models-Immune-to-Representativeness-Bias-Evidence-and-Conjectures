Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distributions of height in the city and in the specific neighborhood.

Since 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we can take this as a baseline distribution. However, we also know that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, the distribution is slightly differentâ€”80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

With this information, we might intuitively think that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller would be higher in this neighborhood than in the city overall. However, we must remember that the height distribution in the neighborhood cannot directly influence the probability that the attacker was of a certain height unless we have additional information about the attacker.

Since we don't have any more specific information about the attacker, we can only use the baseline city-wide distribution. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is still 15%, which is the same as the city-wide distribution.
