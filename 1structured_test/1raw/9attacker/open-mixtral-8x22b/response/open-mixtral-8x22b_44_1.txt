Based on the information provided, the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the city as a whole. This is because 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, compared to 15% in the city.

However, it's important to note that this information alone does not definitively determine the height of the attacker. The height of the attacker is not necessarily representative of the average height in the neighborhood or city.

Given the information, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.20, based on the neighborhood statistics}

This is a rough estimate and not a definitive answer, as the actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors not provided in the question.
