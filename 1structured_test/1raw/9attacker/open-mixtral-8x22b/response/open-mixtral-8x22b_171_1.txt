Based on the information provided, the height of the attacker is not directly known. However, we can use the given population statistics to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This would be the baseline probability. However, we are also given that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller is higher, at 20%.

Since the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, it would be more reasonable to use this local statistic to estimate the probability. Therefore, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.

This is a probabilistic estimate and not a certainty, as individual height can vary and the actual attacker's height may not follow the general trend of the neighborhood.
