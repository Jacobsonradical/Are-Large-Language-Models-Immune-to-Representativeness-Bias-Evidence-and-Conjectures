Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that an attacker chosen randomly from that population would also have a 20% chance of being 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
