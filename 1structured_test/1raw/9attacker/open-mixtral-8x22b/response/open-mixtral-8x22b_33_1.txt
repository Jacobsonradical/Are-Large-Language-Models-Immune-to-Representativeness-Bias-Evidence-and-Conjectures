Based on the provided information, the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller depends on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being that height or taller is also 20%, or 0.2 in the range of 0 to 1.

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that in the city, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller. This is the general distribution of heights in the city.
2. However, the police investigation reveals that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that this neighborhood has a higher proportion of taller people compared to the city's average.
3. Without any other specific information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the neighborhood's height distribution to estimate the probability of the attacker's height.
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.2, based on the neighborhood's height distribution.

So, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.2}
