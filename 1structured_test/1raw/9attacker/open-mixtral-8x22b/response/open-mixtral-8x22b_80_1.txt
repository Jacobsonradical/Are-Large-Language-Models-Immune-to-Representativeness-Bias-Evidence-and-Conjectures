Given the information, we can make an educated estimate about the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to consider this local demographic distribution.

However, we should also keep in mind that this is just an estimate and not a certainty, as the height of the attacker could still fall outside of this distribution. Nonetheless, based on the given information, we can assume that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
