Given the information, we know that the city population has 15% of people 185 cm or taller. However, the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller people (20%). Since the attacker is likely to be from the neighborhood, it would make sense to base our estimate on the neighborhood's demographics.

Thus, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
