Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be higher in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred than in the city as a whole. This is because the neighborhood has a higher percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller compared to the city's overall population.

However, it's important to note that this doesn't definitively mean the attacker was 185 cm or taller. It simply means that the likelihood is higher in this neighborhood than it would be in the city overall.

That being said, the probability would be estimated as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

So, the answer in the requested format would be:
{probability: 0.2}
