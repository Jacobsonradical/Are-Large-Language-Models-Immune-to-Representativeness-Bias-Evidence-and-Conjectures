Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the city and the specific neighborhood.

Since the neighborhood has a higher proportion of taller individuals (20%) compared to the city average (15%), it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is also higher than the city average.

However, without further context or information about the attacker or the circumstances of the attack, we cannot make a definitive conclusion. We can only estimate the probability based on the given population statistics.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}

This estimate is based on the proportion of individuals 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
