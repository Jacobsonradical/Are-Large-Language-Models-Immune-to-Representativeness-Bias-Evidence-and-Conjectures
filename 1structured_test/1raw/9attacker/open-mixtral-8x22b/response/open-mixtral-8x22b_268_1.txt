Given that the attack occurred at night and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we cannot definitively say that the attacker was taller than 185 cm. However, we can use the available information to make an educated guess.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion is even higher, at 20%. Given that the attacker was from this neighborhood, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than the city average but lower than the neighborhood average, as the attacker is just one individual and not the entire neighborhood.

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.18, which is a rough average between the city average (0.15) and the neighborhood average (0.20)}
