Based on the given information, if we assume that the attacker is a random person from the neighborhood, then the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be equal to the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller. This proportion is given as 20%. However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and actual probability might vary depending on other factors such as specific time of the attack, any known motives, and other contextual information.
