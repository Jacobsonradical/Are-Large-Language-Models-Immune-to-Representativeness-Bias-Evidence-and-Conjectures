Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to use this proportion as an estimate for the probability that the attacker was in this height range.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.20}
