Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would depend on the population distribution in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being in this height range is also 20%.

However, it's important to note that this is an estimate and should not be taken as a definitive answer. The actual probability could be different due to various factors not mentioned in the question, such as the time of the attack, the victim's height, or any other relevant circumstances.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.2}
