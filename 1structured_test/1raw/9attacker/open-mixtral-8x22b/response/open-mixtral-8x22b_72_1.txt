Based on the information provided, we can see that the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the overall city population (15%). This suggests that there might be a higher likelihood that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that we cannot definitively determine the attacker's height based solely on this statistical information. The actual probability would depend on other factors such as the distribution of heights within the taller group, the eyewitness accounts (if any), and other physical evidence.

Given the constraints of the question and the data provided, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are of that height or taller, which is 20%.
