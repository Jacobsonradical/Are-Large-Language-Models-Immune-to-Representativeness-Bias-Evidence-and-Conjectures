Based on the given information, the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller depends on the population statistics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker was also 185 cm or taller.
