Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the city and the specific neighborhood. However, it's important to note that this is a probability estimate and not a certainty.

Given that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we can use these percentages as a baseline for the city's height distribution. However, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where the distribution is slightly different (80% are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller), it might be more appropriate to use the neighborhood's height distribution for the estimate.

Therefore, based on the neighborhood's height distribution, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
