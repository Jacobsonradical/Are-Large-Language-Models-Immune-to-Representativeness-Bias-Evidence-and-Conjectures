Given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker's height follows the height distribution of the neighborhood's population. However, this is an estimation, and without further information about the attacker or any specific evidence, we cannot determine the exact height of the attacker.

That being said, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be:

{probability: 0.20}
