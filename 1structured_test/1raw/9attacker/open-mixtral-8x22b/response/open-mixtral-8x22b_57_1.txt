Based on the information provided, we don't know anything specific about the attacker other than the fact that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Without any further information about the attacker, the most reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.
