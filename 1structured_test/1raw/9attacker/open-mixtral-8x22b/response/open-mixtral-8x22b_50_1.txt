Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would depend on whether we assume that the attacker was a resident of the neighborhood or not.

If we assume that the attacker was a resident of the neighborhood, then we can use the given probabilities for that neighborhood. In this case, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be 0.20 (or 20%).

On the other hand, if we assume that the attacker was not a resident of the neighborhood and could be any person from the city, then we should use the probabilities for the city. In this case, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be 0.15 (or 15%).

Without more information, it is not possible to definitively say which assumption is more appropriate. However, if we go by the information provided which focuses on the neighborhood, it might be reasonable to assume that the attacker was a resident of the neighborhood.

So, based on the information provided and assuming the attacker was a resident of the neighborhood, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
