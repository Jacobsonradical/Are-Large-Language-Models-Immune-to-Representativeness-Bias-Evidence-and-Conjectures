Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the neighborhood statistics as more relevant than the overall city statistics. This is because the crime occurred in the neighborhood, and the characteristics of the neighborhood population are more likely to be representative of the attacker's height.

Using the neighborhood statistics, we know that 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on this information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
