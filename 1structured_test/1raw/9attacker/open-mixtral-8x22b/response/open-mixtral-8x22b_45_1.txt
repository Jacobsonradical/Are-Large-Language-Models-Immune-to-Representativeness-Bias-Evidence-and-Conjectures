Given the information, it appears that the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of individuals who are 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city as a whole (15%). Since the victim could not see the attacker's height and the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it is reasonable to use the neighborhood's height distribution for estimating the probability.

Therefore, based on the given data, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}
