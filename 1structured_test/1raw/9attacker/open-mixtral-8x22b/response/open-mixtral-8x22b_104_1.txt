Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

In the city as a whole, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion is higher at 20%. Since the attacker was in this neighborhood, it is reasonable to assume that they are more likely to be part of this neighborhood's population than the city's overall population.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.20}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the attacker is a random member of the neighborhood population, and does not take into account any other information about the attacker or the circumstances of the attack. It is also important to note that this estimate is just that – an estimate – and the actual probability could be higher or lower depending on additional information that is not provided in the question.
