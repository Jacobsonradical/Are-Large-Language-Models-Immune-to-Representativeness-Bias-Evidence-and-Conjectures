Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller would depend on the specific population of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being of that height is also 20%, or 0.2, if we assume that all heights are equally likely. However, without further information about the attacker or the circumstances of the attack, this is just an estimate.

{probability: 0.2}
