Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be higher in the neighborhood where the attack occurred than in the city as a whole. This is because the proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood (20%) is greater than in the city (15%).

However, it's important to note that this probability is not a certainty. The actual probability could be influenced by other factors not mentioned, such as the specific demographics of people active in the area at the time of the attack, or any personal details about the victim that might affect who would target them.

Given the information, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on the neighborhood statistics:

{probability: 0.20}
