Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 80% of the people in that neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. This estimate assumes that the attacker was randomly selected from the population of the neighborhood, which may not be the case in reality.
