Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the given statistics about the population in the city and the specific neighborhood. However, it's important to note that these statistics are not direct evidence of the attacker's height, and other factors should be considered during an actual police investigation.

In this case, we can use the fact that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller and 20% of the neighborhood's population is of the same height range. Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it might be reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is more likely to follow the neighborhood's distribution.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.20}

This means there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the given information.
