Given that the attacker's height is unknown, we can use the available information about the population and the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of people are 185 cm or taller, this information can serve as our starting point for the probability estimate. However, it is important to note that this probability does not account for individual characteristics of the attacker, such as strength or agility, which could also be relevant factors.

Given the information available, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.2}

This estimate is based solely on the height distribution of the neighborhood's population and does not take into account any other factors that may influence the probability of a particular individual being the attacker.
