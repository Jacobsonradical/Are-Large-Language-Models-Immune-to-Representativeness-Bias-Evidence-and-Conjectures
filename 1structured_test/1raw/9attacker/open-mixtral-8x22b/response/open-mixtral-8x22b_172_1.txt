Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the neighborhood's demographic data. Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker also has a 20% chance of being 185 cm or taller.

It is important to note that this probability is a rough estimate and should not be taken as a definitive answer, as there could be other factors influencing the attacker's height that are not accounted for in this analysis.

Here is the probability in the requested format:
{probability: 0.2}
