After considering the given information, it appears that the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the specific neighborhood where the crime occurred compared to the overall city population. However, we cannot definitively say that the attacker is taller due to the lack of direct evidence and the fact that height alone does not determine the likelihood of committing a crime.

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to estimate that there is a 0.2 probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
