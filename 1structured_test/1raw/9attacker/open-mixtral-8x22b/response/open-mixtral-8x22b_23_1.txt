Based on the information provided, the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller depends on the population demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that there's a 0.2 probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, this is a rough estimate and the actual probability could be different.
