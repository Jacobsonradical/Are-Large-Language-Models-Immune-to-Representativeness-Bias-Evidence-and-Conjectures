The information given suggests that the attacker's height is more likely to be 185 cm or taller if we consider the neighborhood statistics rather than the city's general population. However, we don't have any specific information about the attacker.

In the absence of any specific information about the attacker, a reasonable assumption is that the attacker's height is equally likely to be any height found in the population. This means that in this case, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller would be the same as the proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood.

So, the probability would be:
{probability: 0.20}

This is a very rough estimate and the actual probability could be different. For example, if the attacker was wearing high-heeled shoes or if the victim was shorter than average, this could affect the estimation.

Also, it's important to note that this probability doesn't necessarily mean that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, just that there's a 20% chance based on the available information. Without more specific evidence, we can't make a definitive determination about the attacker's height.
