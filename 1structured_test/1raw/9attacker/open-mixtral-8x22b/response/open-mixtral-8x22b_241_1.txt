Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that there is a 0.2 probability that the attacker's height was in that range.

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and the actual probability could be different. The probability could be influenced by other factors, such as the attacker's motivation, opportunity, and ability to commit the crime, as well as any potential biases in the data.

That being said, following your requested format:

{probability: 0.2}
