Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by using the statistics from the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This is because the neighborhood statistics give a more specific and relevant estimate for the attacker's height than the city-wide statistics.

The police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on the given data, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
