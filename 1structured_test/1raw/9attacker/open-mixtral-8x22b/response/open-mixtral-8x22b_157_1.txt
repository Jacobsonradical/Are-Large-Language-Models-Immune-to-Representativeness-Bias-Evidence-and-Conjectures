Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the characteristics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker also has a 20% chance of being in that height range.

However, it's important to note that this probability is based solely on the height distribution in the neighborhood and does not take into account any other factors that might influence the likelihood of a given individual being the attacker.

That said, using the given format:

{probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

{probability: 0.2}
