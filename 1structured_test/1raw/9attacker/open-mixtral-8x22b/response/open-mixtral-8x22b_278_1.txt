Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood's height distribution. Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, this can serve as an estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was in this range.

Keep in mind that this is an estimate and not a definitive answer, as the actual probability might be influenced by other factors not mentioned in the question, such as the attacker's specific motives or their method of attack.

Based on the provided information:
{probability: 0.2, your estimate: 20%, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
