Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker also has a 20% chance of being in this height range.

However, it's essential to note that this is just an estimate based on population statistics and does not guarantee the attacker's height. Other factors could influence the actual probability, such as the specific demographics of people present in the area at the time of the attack or any additional information obtained through the investigation.

That being said, based on the given data, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
