Given the information, we can't definitively say that the attacker was taller or shorter than 185 cm. However, we can estimate the probability based on the given population statistics.

The citywide statistics suggest that there's a 15% chance of encountering someone 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this probability increases to 20%.

Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, it might be more reasonable to use the neighborhood statistics for our estimate. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).

So, in the requested format:
{probability: 0.2}
