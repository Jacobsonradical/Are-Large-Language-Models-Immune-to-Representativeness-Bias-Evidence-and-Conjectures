Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller depends on the context. If we assume that the attacker was randomly chosen from the population of the city, then the probability would be 0.15. However, if the attacker was chosen from the neighborhood where the attack occurred, then the probability would be 0.20, since 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Without any additional information, we cannot definitively determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, based on the given information, we can estimate that the probability is likely between 0.15 and 0.20.

Here's my estimate of the probability:

{probability: 0.175}

This estimate assumes that the attacker was equally likely to be chosen from the city population as a whole and from the neighborhood in which the attack occurred. However, this is just a rough estimate, and the actual probability could be higher or lower depending on other factors such as the time of day, the location of the attack, and any other relevant information about the attacker.
