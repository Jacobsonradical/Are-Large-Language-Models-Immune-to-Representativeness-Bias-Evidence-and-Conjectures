Given the information, we are dealing with conditional probability, specifically the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood.

Let A be the event that a person is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that a person is from the specific neighborhood.

We are given:
- P(A), the probability that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller: 0.15
- P(A|B), the probability that a person from the specific neighborhood is 185 cm or taller: 0.20

However, we cannot directly use P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, because we don't have information about the probability of a person from the neighborhood committing the attack.

Since the height of the attacker is unknown and we only have information about the height distribution in the city and the specific neighborhood, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as a better estimate for the attacker's height, as the attack occurred there.

Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is P(A|B), which is 0.20 or 20%.
