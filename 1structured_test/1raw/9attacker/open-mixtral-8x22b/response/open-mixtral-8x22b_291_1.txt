Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the neighborhood demographics. Since the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city average (15%), it is reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is more likely to fall within this range.

However, we cannot definitively determine the attacker's height based solely on this information, as the height of the attacker could still fall within either category. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is higher than the city average but lower than 100%.
