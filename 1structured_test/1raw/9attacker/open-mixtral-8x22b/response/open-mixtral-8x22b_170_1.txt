Based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to use the height distribution in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred as a proxy for estimating the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This is because the height distribution of the entire city might not accurately reflect the height distribution of the specific neighborhood.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, assuming that the height of the attacker is a random variable independent of any other factor, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as 0.20 (20%).

However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and does not constitute definitive proof of the attacker's height. Other factors, such as eyewitness accounts, physical evidence, and the victim's perception of the attacker's size, could also influence this probability.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.20}
