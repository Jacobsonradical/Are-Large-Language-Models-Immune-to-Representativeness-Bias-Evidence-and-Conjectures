Based on the information provided, the height of the attacker is unknown. However, we can make an educated guess based on the height distribution of the population in the city and the specific neighborhood.

The city's population overall has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller. However, the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller people, with 20% being 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in that specific neighborhood, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker is likely to be from that area. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller would be based on the neighborhood statistics.

{probability: 0.2, based on the 20% of the neighborhood population being 185 cm or taller}
