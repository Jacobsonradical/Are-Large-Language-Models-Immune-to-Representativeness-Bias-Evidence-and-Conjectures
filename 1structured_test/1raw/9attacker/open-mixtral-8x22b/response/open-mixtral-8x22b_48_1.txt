Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

While the overall city population has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller, the neighborhood in question has a higher proportion of taller individuals, with 20% being 185 cm or taller. Since the attacker was from this neighborhood, it is reasonable to use the neighborhood's height distribution for our estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%).

Final answer:
{probability: 0.20}
