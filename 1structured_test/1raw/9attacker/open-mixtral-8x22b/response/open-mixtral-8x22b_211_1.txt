Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, this could serve as an estimate for the probability that the attacker was also 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate, as the height of the attacker could still be shorter than 185 cm. The actual probability might be different, depending on additional factors not provided in the question, such as any specific characteristics of the attacker mentioned by the victim or witnesses, or any other evidence discovered during the police investigation.

That being said, based on the information given:
