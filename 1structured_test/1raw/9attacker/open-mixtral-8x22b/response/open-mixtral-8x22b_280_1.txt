Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the population statistics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. However, without more specific information about the attacker, such as whether they are a resident of the neighborhood or not, we can only make an estimate based on the available data.

Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, it follows that 20% are 185 cm or taller. This percentage is higher than the city's average (15%), suggesting a slightly higher probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller if we assume the attacker was a resident of the neighborhood.

However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and does not guarantee the actual height of the attacker. The actual probability could be influenced by many other factors not included in the provided data.
