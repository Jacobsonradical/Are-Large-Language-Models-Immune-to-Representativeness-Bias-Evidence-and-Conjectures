Based on the information given, it seems that the height of the attacker is more likely to be 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as 20% of the people meet this criteria, compared to 15% in the city as a whole. However, this information alone does not allow us to definitively determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Without more information about the specific characteristics of the attacker, such as their weight, build, or any other distinguishing features, we cannot make a definitive estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, based on the information given, it is reasonable to assume that the probability is higher than in the city as a whole, but still less than 100%.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
