Given the information that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can start with an initial probability of 0.15 for the attacker being 185 cm or taller. However, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller is higher (20%), this additional information should be factored into our estimate.

Although we don't know the exact relationship between the city's population and the neighborhood, we can use the neighborhood's proportion as a more specific and relevant data point. Therefore, based on the information given, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
