Given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, and without any specific information pointing towards a different distribution for attackers, it is reasonable to assume that the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller follows the same distribution as the general population in that neighborhood. Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.20}
