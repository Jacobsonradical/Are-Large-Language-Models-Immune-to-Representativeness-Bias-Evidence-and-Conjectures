Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the specific population distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker's height follows the same distribution.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.2}

This is an estimate based on the given data and assumes that the height of the attacker is a random variable that follows the same distribution as the height of people in the neighborhood. It does not account for any specific information about the attacker or the circumstances of the attack.
