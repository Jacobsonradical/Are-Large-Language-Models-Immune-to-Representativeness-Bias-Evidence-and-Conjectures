Based on the information provided, we can make an educated estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Given that the population in the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city average (15%), it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being of this height range is higher than the city average.

However, we don't have any specific information about the attacker's height, so we can only use the available data for our estimation. In this case, we can use the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood as our estimate of the probability:

{probability: 0.20}

This means that there is a 20% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the given data.
