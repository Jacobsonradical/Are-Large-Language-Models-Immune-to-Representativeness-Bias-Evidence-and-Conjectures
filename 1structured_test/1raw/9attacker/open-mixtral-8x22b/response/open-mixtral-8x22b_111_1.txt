Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the city and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion is higher, with 20% of the people being 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, it is more reasonable to consider the distribution of heights in this neighborhood rather than in the entire city. Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.20}

This means that there is a 20% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the height distribution in the neighborhood.
