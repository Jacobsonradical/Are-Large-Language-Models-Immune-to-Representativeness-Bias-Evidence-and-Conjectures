Given the information provided, it's important to note that we cannot determine the exact probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as we don't have enough information about the attacker. However, we can estimate the probability based on the information given about the population demographics.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, we also know that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that taller individuals might be more prevalent in this neighborhood compared to the city's average.

Without any other specific information about the attacker, we might consider the neighborhood demographic more relevant to the case. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller could be based on the neighborhood demographic.

{probability: 0.20, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Again, this is an estimate based on the information provided and assumes that the attacker is a random individual from the neighborhood. The actual probability could be different if there is additional information about the attacker.

This is not a definitive answer, but an estimate based on the provided information and statistical reasoning.
