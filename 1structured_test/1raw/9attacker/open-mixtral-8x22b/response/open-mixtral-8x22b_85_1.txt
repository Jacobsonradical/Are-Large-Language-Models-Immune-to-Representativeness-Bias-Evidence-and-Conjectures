Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller, we can infer that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%).

However, it's important to note that this estimation is based on the assumption that the attacker is a random individual from the neighborhood and does not take into account any other factors that may influence the attacker's height, such as age or gender.
