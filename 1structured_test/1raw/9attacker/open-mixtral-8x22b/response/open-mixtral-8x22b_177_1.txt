Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the population statistics of the city and the specific neighborhood. However, it's important to note that this is an estimation and not a definitive answer, as we don't have specific information about the attacker.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood, this number is higher, at 20%. Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it might be reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is more likely to follow the neighborhood's distribution than the city's.

However, we don't know if the attacker is a resident of the neighborhood or just happened to be there at the time of the attack. If we assume that the attacker is equally likely to be a resident or a non-resident, we could take a weighted average of the city and neighborhood probabilities: (0.15 * 0.5) + (0.20 * 0.5) = 0.175.

But this is a simplification and depends on several assumptions. In a real-world scenario, other factors like the time of the attack, the nature of the attack, and other evidence could influence this estimate.

Given these considerations, my estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.175.
