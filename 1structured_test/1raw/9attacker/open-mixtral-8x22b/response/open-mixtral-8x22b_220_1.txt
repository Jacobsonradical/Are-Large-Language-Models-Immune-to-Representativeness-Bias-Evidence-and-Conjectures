Based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is more likely related to the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred rather than the general city population. This is because the attacker was more likely to be from the local area.

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it's plausible to estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

However, this is a statistical estimate and not a definitive answer, as individual cases can always vary from the general trend.
