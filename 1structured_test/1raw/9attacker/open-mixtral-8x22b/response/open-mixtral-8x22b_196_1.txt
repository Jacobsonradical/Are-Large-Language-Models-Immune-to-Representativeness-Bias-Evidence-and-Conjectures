Given the information, we know that in the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, that proportion is higher, at 20%. This suggests that taller individuals might be overrepresented in that neighborhood compared to the city as a whole.

Since the attacker was not identified and the only clue is the demographic data of the neighborhood, it's reasonable to base our estimate on the height distribution of the neighborhood. Therefore, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of such individuals in the neighborhood, which is 20%.

In probability terms, this can be represented as:
{probability: 0.20}
