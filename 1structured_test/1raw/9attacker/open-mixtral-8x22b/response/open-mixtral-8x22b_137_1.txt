Based on the information provided, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as a more specific reference for estimating the attacker's height, as it is a more localized data point than the overall city's height distribution.

Given that 80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, it follows that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Since the victim could not see the attacker's height and we have no other information to suggest the attacker is more likely to be a certain height, we can use this 20% value as our best estimate for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
