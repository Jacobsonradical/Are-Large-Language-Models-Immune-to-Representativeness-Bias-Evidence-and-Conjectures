Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the height distribution of the population in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being this height or taller is also 20%, or 0.2, assuming that the attacker was a random individual from that population.

Here's the strict format:
{probability: 0.2}
