Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the city and in the specific neighborhood.

Since we don't have any specific information about the attacker's height, we can assume that the attacker is a random person in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, while 80% are shorter.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%).

So, the answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.20}
