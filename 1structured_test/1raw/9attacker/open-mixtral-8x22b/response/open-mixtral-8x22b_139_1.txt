Given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, and without any other specific information about the attacker, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker's height follows the same distribution as the neighborhood population. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.20}
