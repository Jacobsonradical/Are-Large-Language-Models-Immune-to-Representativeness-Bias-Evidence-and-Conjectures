Based on the information provided, the general population data suggests that 15% of people are 185 cm or taller. However, the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller individuals, with 20% being 185 cm or taller. Since the attacker was not identified and the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, it's reasonable to consider the neighborhood's population statistics as a better indicator of the attacker's height.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
