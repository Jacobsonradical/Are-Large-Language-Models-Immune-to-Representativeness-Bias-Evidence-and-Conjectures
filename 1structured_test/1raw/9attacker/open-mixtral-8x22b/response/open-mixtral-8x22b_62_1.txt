Based on the information provided, it appears that the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the specific neighborhood (20%) than in the city as a whole (15%). However, this doesn't necessarily mean the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as we don't have any direct evidence linking the attacker's height to the neighborhood's height distribution.

But, if we were to make an estimate based solely on the height distribution in the neighborhood, we could say that there's a higher probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller compared to the city's average.

That being said, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and not a definitive answer, as there are many other factors that could influence the attacker's height.

Here's the formatted answer:
{probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
