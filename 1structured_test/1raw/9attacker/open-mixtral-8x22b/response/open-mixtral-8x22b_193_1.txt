Given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, and without any additional information about the attacker, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker's height follows the distribution of heights in that neighborhood. Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2, or 20%.

However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and does not guarantee the actual height of the attacker. The true probability may be higher or lower depending on other factors not considered here, such as witness testimonies, physical evidence, or the victim's perception of the attacker's height.
