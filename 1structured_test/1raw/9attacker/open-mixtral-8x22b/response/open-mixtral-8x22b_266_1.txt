Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would depend on whether we consider the city's overall statistics or the neighborhood's specific statistics.

If we were to use the city's overall statistics, we would estimate that there is a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. However, since the crime occurred in a specific neighborhood where the proportion of taller individuals is higher, it would make more sense to use the neighborhood's statistics.

Using the neighborhood's statistics, we would estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This estimation assumes that the height of the attacker is a random variable independent of their propensity for crime, which might not be entirely accurate in reality.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
