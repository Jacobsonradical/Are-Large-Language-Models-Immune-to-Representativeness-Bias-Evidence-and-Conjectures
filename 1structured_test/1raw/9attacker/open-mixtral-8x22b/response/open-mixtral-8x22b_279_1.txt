Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine the height of the attacker. However, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the given population statistics.

Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller (compared to 15% in the overall city), it is reasonable to assume that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is higher in this neighborhood than in the city as a whole.

Therefore, we can estimate the probability as follows:
{probability: 0.20}

Again, this is just an estimate based on the given population statistics and does not guarantee that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
