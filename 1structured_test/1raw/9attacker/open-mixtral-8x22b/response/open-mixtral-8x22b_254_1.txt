Probability estimation in such cases involves considering both the general population statistics and the specific neighborhood statistics. However, without specific information about the attacker or a known correlation between height and likelihood to commit a crime, we cannot definitively say that the attacker's height is influenced by these statistics.

That being said, we can still use these statistics as a rough guide to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given that the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the overall city population (15%), it might be reasonable to assume that the attacker's height follows this local distribution.

However, it's important to remember that this is a rough estimate and not a definitive answer.
