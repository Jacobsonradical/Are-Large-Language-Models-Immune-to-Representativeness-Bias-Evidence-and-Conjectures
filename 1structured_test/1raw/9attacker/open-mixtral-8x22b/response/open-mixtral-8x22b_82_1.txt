Based on the information provided, it seems that the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the neighborhood where the attack occurred than in the city as a whole. However, without specific information about the attacker or their relationship to the victim or the neighborhood, we cannot definitively say that the attacker is taller than 185 cm.

In the city, the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller is 15%, or 0.15. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, this probability is higher, at 20%, or 0.20.

Given that the attacker was in this neighborhood, we might expect their height to be distributed according to the neighborhood's height distribution. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be 0.20, or 20%.

However, this is still an estimate and would depend on various factors such as the exact location of the attack, the time of the attack, and any other information that might be available about the attacker.

So, in the requested format:
{probability: 0.20}
