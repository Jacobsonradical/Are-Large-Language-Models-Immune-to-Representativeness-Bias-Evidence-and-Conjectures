To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the neighborhood statistics. However, since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it is more relevant to base our estimate on the neighborhood statistics.

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can use this as our estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

So, the estimated probability is 0.20 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.20}
