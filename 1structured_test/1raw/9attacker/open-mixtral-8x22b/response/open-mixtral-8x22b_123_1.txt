Based on the information provided, the height of the attacker is unknown and the victim did not see the attacker. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the height of the attacker. However, we can make an estimate based on the population statistics of the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, while in the neighborhood, this percentage increases to 20%. Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it may be reasonable to use the neighborhood statistics as a basis for our estimate.

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and not a definitive answer. The actual height of the attacker could be different, as the attacker may not be a resident of the neighborhood or may not fit the general height distribution of the population.

That being said, based on the information given:
{probability: 0.2, which corresponds to a 20% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller}
