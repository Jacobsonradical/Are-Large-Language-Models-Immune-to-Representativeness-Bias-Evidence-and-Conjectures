Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine the height of the attacker. However, we can use the given probabilities to make an estimate.

In the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Since the attacker was in this neighborhood at the time of the attack, it would be reasonable to use the neighborhood's height distribution rather than the city's to estimate the attacker's height.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller would be estimated to be 0.20 (or 20%).

Final answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.20}
