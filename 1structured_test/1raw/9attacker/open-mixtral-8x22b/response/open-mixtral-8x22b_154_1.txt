Based on the information given, it seems reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is more likely to reflect the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred rather than the entire city. This is because the attacker is more likely to be a resident of the neighborhood.

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is also 20%, or 0.2.

However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on the available information and assumptions. The actual probability could be different, depending on other factors not mentioned in the question.

So, in the requested format:

{probability: 0.2}
