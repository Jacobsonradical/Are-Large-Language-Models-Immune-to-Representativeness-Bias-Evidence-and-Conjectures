Given the information, we can't definitively say the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as we don't have enough data to make a precise calculation. However, we can make an educated guess based on the statistics provided.

The overall population of the city shows that 15% of people are 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this percentage increases to 20%. This could suggest that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than the city average due to the neighborhood's demographics.

However, it's important to note that these are just statistics and do not guarantee that the attacker falls into this height range. Other factors, such as the attacker's opportunity, motive, and means, should also be considered in the investigation.

Under the assumption that height is the only factor influencing the probability, we could estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood average:

{probability: 0.20}
