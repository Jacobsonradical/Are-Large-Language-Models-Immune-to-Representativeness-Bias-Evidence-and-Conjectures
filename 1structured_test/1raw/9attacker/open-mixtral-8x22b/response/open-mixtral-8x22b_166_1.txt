Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be higher in the neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the general population of the city. This is because the percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood is 20%, as opposed to 15% in the city as a whole.

However, it's important to note that this information alone does not definitively prove that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. It simply suggests that, if the attacker were a random individual from that neighborhood, there would be a higher probability that they are in the taller portion of the population.

So, based on this information:
{probability: 0.20}

This probability is an estimate and should be used cautiously, as it does not account for any other factors that could influence the attacker's height, nor does it account for any other relevant information about the attack.
