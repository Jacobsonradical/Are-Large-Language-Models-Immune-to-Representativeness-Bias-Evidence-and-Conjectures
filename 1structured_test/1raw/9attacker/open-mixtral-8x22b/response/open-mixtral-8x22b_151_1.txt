Based on the information provided, the general population of the city has a higher percentage of people shorter than 185 cm (85%) compared to the neighborhood in which the attack occurred (80%). This means that the neighborhood has a relatively higher percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city average (15%).

However, this information alone doesn't directly tell us the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as it doesn't account for other factors such as the distribution of heights within the taller group, the time of the attack, the likelihood of different height groups to commit such a crime, and so on.

That being said, if we were to make a very rough estimate based solely on the height distribution in the neighborhood, we might say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than the city average but lower than the neighborhood average (due to the factors mentioned above).

So, assuming the attacker was randomly selected from the population of the neighborhood, a rough estimate might be somewhere around the neighborhood average of 20%, but this is a very rough estimate and the actual probability could be significantly different.
