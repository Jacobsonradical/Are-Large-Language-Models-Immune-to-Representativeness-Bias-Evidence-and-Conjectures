Based on the information provided, we can see that the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller compared to the city as a whole. This suggests that there might be a higher likelihood that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that we're dealing with population statistics, and these don't necessarily reflect the characteristics of an individual, in this case, the attacker. The attacker could be from outside the neighborhood, or they could be an outlier within the neighborhood's population.

That being said, if we were to make an estimate based solely on the information given, we would use the statistics from the neighborhood, as that's the most relevant data we have.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.2, based on the neighborhood statistics}
