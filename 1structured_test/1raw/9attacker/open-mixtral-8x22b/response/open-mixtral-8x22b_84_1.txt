Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the demographics of the city and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, we should also consider the neighborhood's demographics. In this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's demographics over the city's demographics. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is based on the neighborhood's demographics.

Probability: 0.20 (or 20%)
