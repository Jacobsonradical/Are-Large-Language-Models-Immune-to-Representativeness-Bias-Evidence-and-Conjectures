After considering the given information, we can see that the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller compared to the overall city. Since no specific information was provided about the attacker, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as a reference. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
