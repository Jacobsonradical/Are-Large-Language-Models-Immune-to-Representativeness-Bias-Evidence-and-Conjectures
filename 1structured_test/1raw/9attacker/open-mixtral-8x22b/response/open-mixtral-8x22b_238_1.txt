Based on the given information, we can assume that the height of the attacker is a random variable influenced by the height distribution of the population in the city and specifically in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Since the neighborhood has a higher proportion (20%) of people who are 185 cm or taller compared to the city's average (15%), it is reasonable to consider this factor when estimating the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, we should also consider that this probability is not solely determined by the neighborhood's height distribution, as other factors could influence the attacker's height.

Given that we don't have additional context to adjust our estimate, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as the basis for our probability calculation. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2, or 20%.
