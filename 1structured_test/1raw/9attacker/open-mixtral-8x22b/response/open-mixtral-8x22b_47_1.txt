Considering the information provided, the height of the attacker is unknown, and the only clue we have is the height distribution of the population in the city and the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attacker's height is uncertain, we can use the given height distribution as a prior probability.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Given that the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, the proportion of taller people is higher than the city average.

Although we cannot definitively determine the attacker's height, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on the given data, our best estimate would be:

{probability: 0.20, considering the height distribution in the neighborhood}

This probability is an estimate, and it doesn't guarantee that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. It is still possible that a shorter person committed the crime. However, based on the information provided, this is our best estimate using the height distribution in the neighborhood.
