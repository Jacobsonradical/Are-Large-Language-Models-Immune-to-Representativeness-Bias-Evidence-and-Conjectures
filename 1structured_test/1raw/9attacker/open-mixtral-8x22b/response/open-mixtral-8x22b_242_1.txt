Given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, and without any specific information about the attacker or any distinguishing features, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker's height follows the height distribution of the neighborhood's population. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

However, it is essential to note that this is an estimate based on the given population statistics and does not guarantee the actual height of the attacker. The police investigation should consider other factors and evidence in their investigation.
