Based on the information provided, it seems that the height of the attacker in relation to the general population of the city is not necessarily indicative of the height of the attacker in the specific neighborhood where the crime occurred. Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker's height also follows this distribution.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
