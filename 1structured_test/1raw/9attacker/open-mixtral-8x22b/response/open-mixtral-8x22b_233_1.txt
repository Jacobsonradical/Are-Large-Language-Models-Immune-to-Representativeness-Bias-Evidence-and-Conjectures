Based on the information provided, we don't have any specific details about the attacker other than the fact that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Without any additional context, the most reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are of that height or taller.

However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and not a certainty. The actual probability could be different if there are other factors at play that we're not aware of.

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
