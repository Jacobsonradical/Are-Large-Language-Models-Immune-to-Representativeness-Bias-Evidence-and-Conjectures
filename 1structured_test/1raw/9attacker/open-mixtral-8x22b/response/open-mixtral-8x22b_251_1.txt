Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the distribution of heights in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Since the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city average (15%), it suggests that the attacker might have a higher probability of being 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that this is still an estimation, and there are other factors that could influence the actual probability, such as the attacker's motivation, opportunity, and any other available evidence.

That being said, based solely on the height distribution, we can estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

This means there's a 20% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the neighborhood's height distribution.
