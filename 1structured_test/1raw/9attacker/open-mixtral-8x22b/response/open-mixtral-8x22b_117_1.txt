Based on the information provided, we know that in the general city population, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion increases to 20%. Since the attacker was from this neighborhood, it is reasonable to use the neighborhood statistics as the basis for our estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the attacker was a randomly selected individual from the neighborhood population. If additional information about the attacker becomes available, such as their gender, age, or other characteristics that could influence height, the probability estimate could be refined.
