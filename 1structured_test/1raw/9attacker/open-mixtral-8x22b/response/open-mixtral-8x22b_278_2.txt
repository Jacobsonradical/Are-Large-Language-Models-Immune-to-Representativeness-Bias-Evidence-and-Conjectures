Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is higher in the neighborhood where the attack occurred than in the city as a whole. However, since we don't have any other specific information about the attacker, we have to base our estimate solely on the height distribution in the neighborhood.

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
