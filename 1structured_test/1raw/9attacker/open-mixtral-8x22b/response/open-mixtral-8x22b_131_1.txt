Given the information, we can't definitively say what the height of the attacker was, but we can make an educated guess based on the statistics provided.

In the city, there's an 85% chance that a person is shorter than 185 cm, and a 15% chance that they are 185 cm or taller. However, the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where the statistics are slightly different. In this neighborhood, 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, it would be more accurate to base our estimate on the neighborhood statistics rather than the city-wide statistics. Therefore, we can estimate that there's a 20% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Here's the format you requested:
