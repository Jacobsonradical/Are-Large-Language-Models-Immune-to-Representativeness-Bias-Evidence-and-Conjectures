Based on the information provided, it seems that the relevant population for estimating the probability of the attacker's height is the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, not the entire city. This is because the attacker is more likely to be from the local population than from anywhere else in the city.

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is also 20%, or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
