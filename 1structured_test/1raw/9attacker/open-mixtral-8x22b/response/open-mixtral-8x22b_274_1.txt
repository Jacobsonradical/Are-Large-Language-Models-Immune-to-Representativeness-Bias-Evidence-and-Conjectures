Given the provided information, we can infer that the general population statistics suggest an 85% chance that any given individual is shorter than 185 cm, and a 15% chance that they are 185 cm or taller. However, the statistics for the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred indicate a slightly higher proportion of taller individuals, with 20% being 185 cm or taller.

Since the attacker's height is unknown and the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, it would be reasonable to use the neighborhood's height statistics to estimate the probability.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the assumption that the attacker's height is randomly distributed according to the neighborhood's height statistics, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
