Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by considering the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can use this as an estimate for the probability that the attacker was of that height or taller.

However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate based on the given data and does not take into account other factors that could influence the attacker's height, such as the specific circumstances of the attack or any other information about the attacker.

So, in the format you requested:

{probability: 0.2}
