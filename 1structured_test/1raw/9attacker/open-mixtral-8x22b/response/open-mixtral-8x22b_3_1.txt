Given the information, we cannot definitively determine the height of the attacker. However, we can make an informed estimate based on the available statistics.

Since 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, this suggests that there's a higher likelihood that the attacker was also shorter than 185 cm. However, we must also consider that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, which is significantly higher than the city's average of 15%.

Therefore, based on this information, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than the city's average but not necessarily 100% certain.
