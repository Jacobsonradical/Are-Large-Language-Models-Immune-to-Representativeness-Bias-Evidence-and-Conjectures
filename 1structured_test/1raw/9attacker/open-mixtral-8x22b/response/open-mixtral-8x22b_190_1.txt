Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 80% of the people in that neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, it implies that 20% are 185 cm or taller. This is higher than the city's average of 15%. Therefore, using the neighborhood's height distribution as a reference, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.20}
