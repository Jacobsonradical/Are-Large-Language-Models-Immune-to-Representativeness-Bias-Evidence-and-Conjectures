Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say that the attacker was taller than 185 cm. However, we can use the given probabilities to estimate the likelihood.

In the general population of the city, there is a 15% chance that a person is 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this probability increases to 20%.

Given that the attacker was from the neighborhood, we might assume that the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is higher than the city's general population. Therefore, we might estimate the probability to be closer to the neighborhood's proportion of tall people, which is 20%.

However, it's important to note that this is an estimate and not a certainty. The actual height of the attacker could be shorter or taller than 185 cm.
