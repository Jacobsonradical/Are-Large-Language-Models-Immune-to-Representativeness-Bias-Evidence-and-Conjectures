Given that the attack occurred at night and the victim couldn't see the attacker, we don't have any direct information about the attacker's height. However, we can use the population statistics to make an educated guess.

In the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion is higher, at 20%.

Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker is more likely to be from this neighborhood than from the city as a whole. Therefore, we might estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is somewhere between 15% and 20%.

However, without more specific information about the attacker or the circumstances of the attack, this is just an estimate based on the available statistics.

Here's the answer in the format you requested:

{probability: 0.20, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This is based on the assumption that the attacker is from the neighborhood and reflects the higher proportion of taller individuals in that area. However, it's important to remember that this is a statistical estimate and not a certainty.
