Based on the information provided, the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, as compared to the city as a whole. This is due to the fact that the percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller is higher in the neighborhood (20%) than in the city (15%).

However, it's important to note that this doesn't definitively prove that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. It only suggests that there's a higher probability.

Given this, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}

This means that there's a 20% chance, based on the given information. Please remember that this is just an estimate and the actual probability could be different based on other factors not mentioned in the question.
