Based on the given information, if we assume that the attacker is a random individual from the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can use this as our probability estimate.

{probability: 0.20}
