Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, that leaves 20% of the population who are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, assuming no other factors are involved, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).

However, it's important to note that this is a statistical estimate and not a certainty. The actual probability could vary based on other factors not mentioned in the scenario, such as the attacker's motives, the victim's height, or any other specific circumstances related to the attack.
