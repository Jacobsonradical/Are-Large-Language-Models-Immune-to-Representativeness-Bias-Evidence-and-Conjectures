Based on the information provided, the overall population of the city has a higher proportion of people who are shorter than 185 cm (85%) compared to the neighborhood where the attack occurred (80%). This means that the neighborhood has a relatively higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%) than the city as a whole (15%).

Given that the attack happened in this neighborhood, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as a reference for estimating the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be based on the neighborhood's proportion of taller individuals, which is 20%.

In probability terms, this would be represented as:
{probability: 0.20}
