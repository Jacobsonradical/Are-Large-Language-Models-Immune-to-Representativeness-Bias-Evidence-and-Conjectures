Given the information, we can't definitively say that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as this is a matter of probability. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the statistics provided.

The general population statistics indicate that 15% of people are 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion increases to 20%. Since the attacker was from this neighborhood, it's reasonable to use this neighborhood's statistics for our estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.2, or 20%.
