Based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to consider the height distribution in the neighborhood as more relevant than the overall city distribution for estimating the attacker's height. Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can use this as our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2, as 20% is equivalent to a probability of 0.2 when presented as a decimal}
