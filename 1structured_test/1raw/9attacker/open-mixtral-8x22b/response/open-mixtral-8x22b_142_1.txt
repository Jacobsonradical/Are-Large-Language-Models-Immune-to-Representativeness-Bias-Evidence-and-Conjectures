Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine the height of the attacker. However, we can make an estimation based on the probabilities given for the city and the specific neighborhood.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that there is a higher probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller compared to the general population of the city. However, this probability is still limited by the fact that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is based on the given data for the neighborhood and assumes that the attacker's height is a random variable that follows the same distribution as the general population of the neighborhood. It's important to note that this is just an estimate and the actual probability could be different based on other factors not provided in the question.
