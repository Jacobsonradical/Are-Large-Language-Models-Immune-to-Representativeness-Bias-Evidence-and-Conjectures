Based on the given information, we can see that the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the overall city population (15%). However, we cannot definitively say that this difference in proportions directly translates to the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

This is because the height distribution of potential attackers may not follow the same distribution as the general population. Additionally, the fact that the attack occurred at night and from behind suggests that the victim's inability to see the attacker's height might not have any correlation with the height distribution of the general population or the neighborhood population.

Nevertheless, since the question asks for an estimate, and assuming that the height distribution of potential attackers is similar to that of the general population, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as a reference. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
