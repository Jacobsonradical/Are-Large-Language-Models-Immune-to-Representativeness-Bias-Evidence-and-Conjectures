Based on the information provided, the general population of the city has a higher percentage of individuals shorter than 185 cm (85%) compared to the neighborhood in which the attack occurred (80% shorter than 185 cm). This means that the neighborhood has a higher proportion of individuals who are 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city's general population (15%).

Given that the attack occurred in this neighborhood and no other information about the attacker's height was provided, it is reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the height distribution of the neighborhood's population.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.20, or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
