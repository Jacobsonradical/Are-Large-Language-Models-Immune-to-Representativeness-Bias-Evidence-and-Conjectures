In this case, we can't determine the exact probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based solely on the given information. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the population statistics.

The city's overall population has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this percentage is higher at 20%. Since the attacker is more likely to be from this neighborhood, it's reasonable to consider the neighborhood's statistics as more relevant.

So, based on this information, my estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.2}
