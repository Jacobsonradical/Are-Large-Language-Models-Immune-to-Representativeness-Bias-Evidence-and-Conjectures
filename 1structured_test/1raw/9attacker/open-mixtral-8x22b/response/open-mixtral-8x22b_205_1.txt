Based on the information provided, the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred compared to the entire city. However, we cannot definitively determine the exact probability without more specific information about the attacker.

In the absence of such information, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as a reasonable estimate for the attacker's height. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be 0.20 (or 20%).
