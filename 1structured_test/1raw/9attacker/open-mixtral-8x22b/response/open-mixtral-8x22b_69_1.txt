Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller depends on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, it follows that 20% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that there is a higher concentration of taller people in the neighborhood compared to the city as a whole, where only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that this does not guarantee that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. The height of the attacker could be any value, and the distribution of heights in the neighborhood only provides a probability estimate.

Given the information, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is based on the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.
