Given that the attacker's height is unknown and the only information we have is the height distribution of the city and the specific neighborhood, we can use this data to make an educated guess. Since the crime occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller (compared to 15% for the entire city), it is reasonable to assume that the probability of the attacker being this height is higher than the city's average.

However, we must also consider that this probability is not solely determined by the neighborhood's height distribution, as other factors such as the attacker's opportunity, motive, and means could also influence the likelihood. Nevertheless, based on the given height information alone, we can estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.20, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This means that there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the neighborhood's height distribution.
