To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the specific neighborhood distribution.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since the attack occurred in that particular neighborhood, it is more relevant to consider the neighborhood's height distribution.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
