Given the information, we know that the overall population of the city has 15% of individuals who are 185 cm or taller. However, the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller people (20%) compared to the city average.

Since the attacker's height is unknown, we can use the available information to make an educated guess about their height. The relevant data here is the height distribution of people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

So, based on the neighborhood data, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2 when expressed as a decimal.
