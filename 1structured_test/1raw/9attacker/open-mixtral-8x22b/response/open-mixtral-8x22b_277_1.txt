Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would depend on whether we consider the attacker to be a random person from the city or specifically from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

If we consider the attacker to be a random person from the city, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller would be 0.15, since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.

However, if we consider the attacker to be a resident of the neighborhood where the attack occurred, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller would be 0.20, since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it might be more reasonable to use the neighborhood's population statistics. Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.20}

This means there is a 20% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the information provided.
