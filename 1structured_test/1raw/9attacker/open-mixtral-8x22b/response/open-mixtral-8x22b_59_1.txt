Based on the information provided, we can see that the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller compared to the city as a whole. This suggests that there may be an increased likelihood that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that this information alone is not sufficient to definitively determine the height of the attacker. The height of the attacker could still fall into either category, regardless of the statistics.

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, and assuming that height is randomly distributed among the population, we could estimate that the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is also 20%.

But remember, this is just a rough estimate based on the given statistics and does not guarantee the actual height of the attacker.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.2}
