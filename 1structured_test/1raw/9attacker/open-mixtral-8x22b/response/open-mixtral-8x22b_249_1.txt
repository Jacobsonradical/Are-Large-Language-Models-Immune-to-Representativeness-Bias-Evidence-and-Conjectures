Based on the information provided, we can see that the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city average (15%). This suggests that there might be a higher likelihood that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

However, we must be cautious as the height of the attacker is not solely determined by the distribution of heights in the neighborhood. There are many other factors to consider, such as the individual characteristics of the attacker, which we do not know.

Given the information at hand, the best estimate we can make is based on the neighborhood statistics. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (20%).
