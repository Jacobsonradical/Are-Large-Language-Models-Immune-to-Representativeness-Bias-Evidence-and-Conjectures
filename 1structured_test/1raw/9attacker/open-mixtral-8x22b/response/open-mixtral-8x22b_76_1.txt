Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being in this height range is also 20%, or 0.2.

However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumes that height is the only factor considered. In a real investigation, factors such as motive, opportunity, and other physical evidence would also be taken into account.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.2}
