Given the information, we can infer that the neighborhood demographic slightly skews towards taller individuals compared to the city as a whole. However, it's important to note that we don't have any specific information about the attacker other than the neighborhood demographic.

We can use the neighborhood demographic as a prior probability for the attacker's height. This means that without any other information, we would estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

However, this is a very rough estimate and actual probability could be higher or lower depending on various factors that we don't have information about, such as the attacker's motivation, opportunity, and other characteristics.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be:

{probability: 0.20}
