After considering the information given, it appears that the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred than in the city as a whole. This is because the percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller is higher in that neighborhood (20%) than in the city (15%).

However, it's important to note that this information is not definitive. The height of the attacker could still be less than 185 cm, as the majority of people in the neighborhood are still shorter than this height.

Given the information, my estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on the neighborhood statistics, which is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.

So, the answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.2}
