Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the population statistics provided. However, we should note that this is merely an estimate and not a definitive conclusion, as the attacker's height is not confirmed.

We know that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this percentage is higher, at 20%. Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is more likely to follow the neighborhood's distribution than the city's.

Therefore, based on these statistics, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20% when expressed as a percentage).
