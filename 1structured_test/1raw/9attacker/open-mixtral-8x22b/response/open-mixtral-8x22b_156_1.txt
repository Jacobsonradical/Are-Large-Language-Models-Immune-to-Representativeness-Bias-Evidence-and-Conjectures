Given that the attacker's height is unknown, we can use the information provided about the population height distribution in the city and the specific neighborhood as a proxy for estimating the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. However, it is important to note that this is a rough estimate and not a definitive probability.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion increases to 20%. Since the attack took place in this neighborhood, it might be reasonable to give more weight to the neighborhood statistics.

However, we should also consider the city-wide statistics, as they represent a broader population and could provide a more balanced perspective. A possible approach could be to average the two values, giving equal weight to the city and neighborhood statistics:

(0.15 + 0.20) / 2 = 0.175

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.175.

{probability: 0.175}
