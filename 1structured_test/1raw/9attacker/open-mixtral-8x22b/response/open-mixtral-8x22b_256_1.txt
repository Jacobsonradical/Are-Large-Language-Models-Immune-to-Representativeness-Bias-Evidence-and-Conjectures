Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be influenced by the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.20}

This probability is based on the assumption that the attacker was randomly selected from the population of the neighborhood and that height is not a factor that influences the likelihood of being an attacker. In reality, the probability could be different if there are other relevant factors that were not mentioned in the information provided.
