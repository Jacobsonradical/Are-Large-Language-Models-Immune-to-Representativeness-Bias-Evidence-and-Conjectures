Based on the information given, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller depends on whether we assume that the attacker is a random person from the city or specifically from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

If we assume that the attacker is a random person from the city, then the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

If we assume that the attacker is specifically from the neighborhood where the attack occurred, then the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood and we have no other information about the attacker, it seems more reasonable to use the neighborhood statistics.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
