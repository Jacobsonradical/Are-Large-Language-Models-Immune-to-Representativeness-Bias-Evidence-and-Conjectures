Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would depend on whether we consider the city's overall population or the neighborhood's population.

If we consider the city's overall population, the probability would be 0.15, as 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. However, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where the proportion of taller people is higher (20%), it would be more reasonable to base our estimate on the neighborhood's population.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is based on the neighborhood's population statistics:
{probability: 0.20}
