Based on the information provided, it seems that the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is somewhat different from the general population of the city. Specifically, the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller (20% versus 15% in the city as a whole).

However, without any additional information about the attacker, such as their gender, age, or any other relevant characteristics, we can only estimate the probability based on the height distribution in the neighborhood. Therefore, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller would be the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height or taller, which is 20%.

To express this probability as a number between 0 and 1, we can simply convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

Answer: {probability: 0.2}
