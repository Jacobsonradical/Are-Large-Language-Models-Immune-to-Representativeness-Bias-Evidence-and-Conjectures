Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller using the statistics of the neighborhood. Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, and assuming that the attacker was randomly chosen from the population of the neighborhood, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is also 20%.

It's important to note that this is a rough estimate and assumes that the attacker was randomly chosen from the neighborhood population. In reality, there may be other factors that could affect the probability, such as the attacker's motive, opportunity, and means.
