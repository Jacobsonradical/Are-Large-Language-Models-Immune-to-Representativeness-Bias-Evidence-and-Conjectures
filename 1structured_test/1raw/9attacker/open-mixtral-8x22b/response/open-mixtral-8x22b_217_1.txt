After analyzing the given information, it is clear that the overall population of the city has a higher percentage of people shorter than 185 cm (85%) compared to the neighborhood in which the attack occurred (80%). This means that the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%) than the overall city population (15%).

Since the attacker's height is unknown, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as a reference to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, it is important to note that this is an estimate, as individual probabilities may vary.

Based on the neighborhood's height distribution, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
