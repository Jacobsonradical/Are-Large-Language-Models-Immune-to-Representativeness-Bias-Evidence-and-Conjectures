Based on the given information, the height of the attacker is unknown. However, we can use the statistical data provided to estimate the probability.

In the city as a whole, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this proportion increases to 20%. Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, it seems reasonable to use the neighborhood's statistics as a more accurate representation of the potential attacker's height.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.20}
