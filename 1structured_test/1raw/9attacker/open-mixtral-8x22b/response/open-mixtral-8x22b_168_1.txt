Given the provided information, it appears that the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is higher than the city average. This suggests that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller might be higher than the city average as well. However, we must remember that this is only an estimate based on the given data, and the actual probability could be different.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, so we can use this number as an estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. This is an application of the concept of conditional probability, where we are estimating the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in a certain neighborhood.
