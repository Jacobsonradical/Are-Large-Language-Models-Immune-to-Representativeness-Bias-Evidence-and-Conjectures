Based on the information provided, we can see that the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city's average (15%). Since the attacker's height is unknown and no other information is given, we can use this neighborhood statistic as an estimate for the probability of the attacker's height.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
