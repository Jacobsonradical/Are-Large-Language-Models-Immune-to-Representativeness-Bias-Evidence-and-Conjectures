Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine the height of the attacker. However, we can make an informed estimate based on the given probabilities.

The city-wide probability of encountering someone 185 cm or taller is 15%, but in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, this probability increases to 20%. This suggests that there may be a higher concentration of taller individuals in that area.

Since the attacker's height is unknown and the victim could not see the attacker, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as an estimate for the attacker's height. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller would be approximately:

{probability: 0.2, or 20%}
