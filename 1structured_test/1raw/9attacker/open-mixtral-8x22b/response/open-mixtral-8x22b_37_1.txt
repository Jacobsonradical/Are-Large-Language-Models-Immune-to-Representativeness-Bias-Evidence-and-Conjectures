Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the attacker was 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood where the attack occurred because a higher proportion of the population in that neighborhood is of that height compared to the city as a whole. However, we do not have specific information about the attacker that would allow us to definitively determine their height. Therefore, we can only use the available information to make an estimate.

Given that 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that there is a 20% probability that the attacker was of that height. However, this is only an estimate and the actual probability could be higher or lower.

{probability: 0.2}
