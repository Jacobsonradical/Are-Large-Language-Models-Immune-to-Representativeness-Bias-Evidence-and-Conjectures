Based on the information provided, the overall population of the city has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller. However, the neighborhood in which the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller people, with 20% of the population being 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, it's reasonable to use the neighborhood's height distribution for estimating the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be:

{probability: 0.20}
