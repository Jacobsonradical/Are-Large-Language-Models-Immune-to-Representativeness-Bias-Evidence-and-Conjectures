Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would depend on the specific neighborhood in which the attack occurred. Since 80% of the people in that neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, it means that 20% are 185 cm or taller.

However, the fact that the attacker was not identified by their height does not necessarily mean that the attacker was taller. The attack could have been perpetrated by someone of any height, given that the attack was from behind and the victim did not see the attacker.

Therefore, the best estimate we can make for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height or taller, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
