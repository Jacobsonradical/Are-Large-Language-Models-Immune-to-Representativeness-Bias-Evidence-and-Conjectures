Based on the given information, it appears that the attacker's height is more likely to be 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood where the attack occurred than in the city as a whole. However, we don't have enough information to definitively say that the attacker is taller than 185 cm. Nonetheless, we can make an educated estimate based on the proportions given.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we might initially assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is also 20%, or 0.20. However, this assumes that height is the only factor, and that all heights are equally likely to be an attacker.

To refine our estimate, we could consider that taller people might be more likely to be the attacker, simply due to the physical advantage that height can provide. However, without specific data on the correlation between height and likelihood of being an attacker, it's impossible to accurately adjust our estimate in this way.

Therefore, based on the information given, the most reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height or taller, which is 20%, or 0.20.
