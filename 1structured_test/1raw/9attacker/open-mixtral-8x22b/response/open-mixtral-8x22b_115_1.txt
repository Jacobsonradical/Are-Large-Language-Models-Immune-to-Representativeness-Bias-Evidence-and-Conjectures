Based on the information given, we cannot definitively determine the attacker's height. However, we can make an estimate based on the population statistics provided.

Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker also has a 20% chance of being 185 cm or taller. This is because, in the absence of any other information, we can use the neighborhood's height distribution as a proxy for the attacker's height distribution.

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
