To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific and relevant to the case.

According to the given information:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the available data, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
