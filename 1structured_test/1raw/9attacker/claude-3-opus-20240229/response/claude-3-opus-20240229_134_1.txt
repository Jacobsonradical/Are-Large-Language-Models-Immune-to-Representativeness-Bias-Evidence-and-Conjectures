To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides a more relevant distribution of heights compared to the city-wide data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

This estimation is based on the assumption that the attacker is a random person from the neighborhood and that the distribution of heights among potential attackers is the same as the general population in the neighborhood.
