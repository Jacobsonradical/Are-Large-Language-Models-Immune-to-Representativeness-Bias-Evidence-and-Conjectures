In this problem, we need to determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information provided about the city's population and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability, we should consider the more specific information about the neighborhood rather than the general city statistics. The attacker is more likely to be from the neighborhood where the attack took place.

Therefore, based on the neighborhood statistics, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.20}
