To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the relevant information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, rather than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since we don't have any other information about the attacker's height, we can assume that the attacker's height follows the same distribution as the neighborhood's population.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20, or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
