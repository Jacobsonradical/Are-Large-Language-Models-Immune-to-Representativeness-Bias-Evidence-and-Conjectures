To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should rely on the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more relevant data than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the same neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attacker was from the neighborhood and no other information about their height is available, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is equal to the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.20}
