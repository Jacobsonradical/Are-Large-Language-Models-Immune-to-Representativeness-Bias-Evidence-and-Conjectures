To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific and relevant than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be:

{probability: 0.20}

This estimate assumes that the attacker is likely to be from the same neighborhood where the attack took place and that the height distribution of the attackers is similar to the general population of the neighborhood.
