To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific and relevant than the city-wide statistics.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This means that if we randomly select a person from the neighborhood, there is a 20% chance (or a probability of 0.2) that the person will be 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
