To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more specific and relevant data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the same neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack took place in this specific neighborhood, we can estimate the probability based on the local population data.

{probability: 0.20}

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20 (or 20%), based on the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
