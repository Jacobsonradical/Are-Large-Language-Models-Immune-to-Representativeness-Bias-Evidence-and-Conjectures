In this problem, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information about the city's population and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, we should focus on the data from that neighborhood rather than the entire city. The neighborhood data provides more relevant information about the attacker's height.

Therefore, based on the information that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
