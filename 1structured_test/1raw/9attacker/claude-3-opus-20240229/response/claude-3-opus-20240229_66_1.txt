To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more specific and relevant data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Based on this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the attacker is likely to be from the same neighborhood where the attack occurred, and the distribution of heights in that neighborhood is representative of the attacker's height.
