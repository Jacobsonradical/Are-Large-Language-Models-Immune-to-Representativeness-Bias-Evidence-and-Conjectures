To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should focus on the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more specific and relevant data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Based on this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

This estimate assumes that the attacker is a random person from the neighborhood and that the height distribution of the attackers is the same as the general population of the neighborhood.
