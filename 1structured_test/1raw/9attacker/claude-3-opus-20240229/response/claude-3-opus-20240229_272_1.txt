In this problem, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information provided about the city's population and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability, we should focus on the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack took place, as it provides more relevant data.

{probability: 0.20}

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20 (or 20%), based on the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
