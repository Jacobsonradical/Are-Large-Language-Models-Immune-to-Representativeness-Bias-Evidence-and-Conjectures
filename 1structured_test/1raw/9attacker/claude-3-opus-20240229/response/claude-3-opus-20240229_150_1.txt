To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should rely on the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, rather than the general city population data. This is because the neighborhood data is more relevant to the case at hand.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the available information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
