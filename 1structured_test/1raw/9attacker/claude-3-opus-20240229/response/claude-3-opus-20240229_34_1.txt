To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the more specific information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, rather than the general city statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.2}
