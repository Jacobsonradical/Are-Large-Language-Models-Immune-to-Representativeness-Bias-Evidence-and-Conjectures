To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should rely on the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides a more localized and relevant data point.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Using the neighborhood-specific information, we can estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20, or 20%, based on the demographic information of the neighborhood where the attack took place.
