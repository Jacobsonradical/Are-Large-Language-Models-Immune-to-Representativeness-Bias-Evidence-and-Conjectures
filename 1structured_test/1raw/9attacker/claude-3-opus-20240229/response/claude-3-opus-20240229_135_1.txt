To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides a more relevant context than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attacker was randomly selected from the neighborhood population, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is equal to the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.20}
