To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should rely on the more specific information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, rather than the general city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the available information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
