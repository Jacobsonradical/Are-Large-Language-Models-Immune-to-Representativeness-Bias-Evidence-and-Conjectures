To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should focus on the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more specific and relevant data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Assuming that the attacker is likely to be from the same neighborhood, and the height distribution of the attackers is similar to the general population of the neighborhood, we can estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20, or 20%.
