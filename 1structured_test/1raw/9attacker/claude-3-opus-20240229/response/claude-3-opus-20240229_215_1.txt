To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more specific and relevant data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Based on this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

This estimate assumes that the attacker is a random person from the neighborhood and that the distribution of heights among potential attackers is similar to the distribution of heights in the general population of the neighborhood.
