To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific and relevant than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we don't have any additional information about the attacker's height, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is equal to the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
