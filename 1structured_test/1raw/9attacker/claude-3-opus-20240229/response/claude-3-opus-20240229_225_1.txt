To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should rely on the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, rather than the general city population data. This is because the neighborhood data is more directly relevant to the case.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
