To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific and relevant than the city-wide data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Based on this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the attacker is likely to be from the neighborhood where the crime occurred, and in that neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
