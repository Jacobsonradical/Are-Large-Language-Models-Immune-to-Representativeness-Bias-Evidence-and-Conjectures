To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more relevant data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
