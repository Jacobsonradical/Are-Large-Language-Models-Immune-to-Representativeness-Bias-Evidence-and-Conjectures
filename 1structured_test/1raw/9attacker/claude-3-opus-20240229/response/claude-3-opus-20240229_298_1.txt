To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should rely on the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides a more relevant context than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the same neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Based on this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the attacker is likely to be a member of the neighborhood population, and in this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
