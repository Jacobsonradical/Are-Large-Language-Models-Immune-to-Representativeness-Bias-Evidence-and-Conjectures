To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more relevant data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the same neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the data specific to the neighborhood suggests that 20% of the people in that area are 185 cm or taller, which is the best estimate we have for the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
