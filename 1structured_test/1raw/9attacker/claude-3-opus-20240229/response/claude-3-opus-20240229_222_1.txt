To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific and relevant than the city-wide data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Assuming that the attacker is likely to be from the same neighborhood, and without any additional information about the attacker, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as:

{probability: 0.20}

This estimate is based on the available data about the height distribution in the specific neighborhood where the attack took place.
