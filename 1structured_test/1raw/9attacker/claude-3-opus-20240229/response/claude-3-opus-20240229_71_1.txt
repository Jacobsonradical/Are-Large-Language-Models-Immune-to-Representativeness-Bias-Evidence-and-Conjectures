To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the relevant information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given:
- In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack took place in the specific neighborhood, we should use the information about the height distribution in that neighborhood rather than the city as a whole.

Therefore, based on the available information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
