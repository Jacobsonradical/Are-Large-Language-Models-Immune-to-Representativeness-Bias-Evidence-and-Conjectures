To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific and relevant to the case.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as:

{probability: 0.20}

This estimation is based on the assumption that the attacker is likely to be from the same neighborhood where the attack took place, and the distribution of heights in that neighborhood is representative of the attacker's height.
