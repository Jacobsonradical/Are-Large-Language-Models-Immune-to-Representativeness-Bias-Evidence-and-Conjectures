To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should rely on the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides a more relevant and localized context compared to the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the same neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
