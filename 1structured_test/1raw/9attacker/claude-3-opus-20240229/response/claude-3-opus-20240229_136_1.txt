To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should focus on the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more specific and relevant data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Based on this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

The probability is estimated to be 0.20 (or 20%) because the data suggests that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack took place are 185 cm or taller. This local information is more relevant than the city-wide statistics for estimating the attacker's height.
