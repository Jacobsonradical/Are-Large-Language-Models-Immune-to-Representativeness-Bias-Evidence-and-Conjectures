To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more specific and relevant data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attack took place in this specific neighborhood, we should use the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in that neighborhood as our estimate.

{probability: 0.20}
