To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more relevant data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the same neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no additional information to update our prior probability. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is equal to the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.20}
