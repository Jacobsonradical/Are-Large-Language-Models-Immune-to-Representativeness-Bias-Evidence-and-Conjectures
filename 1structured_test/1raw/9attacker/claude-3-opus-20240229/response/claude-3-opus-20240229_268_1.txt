To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides a more accurate representation of the local population compared to the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
