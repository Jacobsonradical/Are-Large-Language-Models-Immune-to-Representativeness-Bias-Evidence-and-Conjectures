To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should focus on the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more specific and relevant data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Based on this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.2}
