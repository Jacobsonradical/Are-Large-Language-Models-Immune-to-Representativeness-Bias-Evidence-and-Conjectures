To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific and relevant than the city-wide statistics.

According to the given information, in the neighborhood where the attack took place:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller

Therefore, based on the available evidence, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
