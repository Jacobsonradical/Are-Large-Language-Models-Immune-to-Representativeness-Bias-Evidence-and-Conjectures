To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more specific and relevant data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Using the data from the neighborhood, we can estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20, or 20%, based on the demographic information of the neighborhood where the attack took place.
