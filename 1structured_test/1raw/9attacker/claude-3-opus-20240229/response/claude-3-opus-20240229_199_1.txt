To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should rely on the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides a more localized and relevant data set.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20, or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
