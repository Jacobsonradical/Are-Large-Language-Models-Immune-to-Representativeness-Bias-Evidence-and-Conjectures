To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific and relevant than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the available information, is:

{probability: 0.2}
