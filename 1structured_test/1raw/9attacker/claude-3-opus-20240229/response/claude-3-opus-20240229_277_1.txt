To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific and relevant than the city-wide statistics.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This means that the probability of a randomly selected person from the neighborhood being 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

Therefore, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
