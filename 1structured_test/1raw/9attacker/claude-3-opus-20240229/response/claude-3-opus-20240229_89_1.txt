To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it provides more relevant data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attacker was from the neighborhood, and no other information about the attacker's height is available, we can estimate the probability based on the neighborhood's height distribution.

{probability: 0.20}

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20 (or 20%), based on the information provided about the neighborhood's population.
