probability: 0.20

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated based on the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker also has a 20% chance of being in that height range.
