The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.2.

This is based on the assumption that the attacker's height follows the same distribution as the general population in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Therefore, since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the estimate for the attacker is also 20%, or 0.2.
