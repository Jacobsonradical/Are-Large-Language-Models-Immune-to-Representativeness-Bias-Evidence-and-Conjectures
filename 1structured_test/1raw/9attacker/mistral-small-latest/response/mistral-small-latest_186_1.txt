{probability: 0.2, assuming the height of the attacker is independent of the motivation to commit the crime}

Explanation: Since the height of the attacker is not related to the event of the attack, we can use the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller as an estimate for the probability of the attacker being that height. In this case, 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, so the estimated probability is 0.2.
