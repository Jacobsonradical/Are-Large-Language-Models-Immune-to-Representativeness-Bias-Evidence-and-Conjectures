The information provided about the attack does not give any indication about the attacker's height. Therefore, to find an estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use the data from the neighborhood where the attack occurred. In that neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

So, the estimated probability is:
{probability: 0.2}
