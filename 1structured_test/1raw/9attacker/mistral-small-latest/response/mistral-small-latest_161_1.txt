{probability: 0.2, which is 20% chance}

This is because the probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm depends on the demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred, not the entire city. Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to estimate that the attacker has a 20% chance of being in this height category.
