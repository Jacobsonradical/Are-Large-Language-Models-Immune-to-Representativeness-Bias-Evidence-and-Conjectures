{probability: 0.20}

Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.20. This estimate is based on the available information about the height distribution in the neighborhood and does not take into account any other factors that could influence the attacker's height.
