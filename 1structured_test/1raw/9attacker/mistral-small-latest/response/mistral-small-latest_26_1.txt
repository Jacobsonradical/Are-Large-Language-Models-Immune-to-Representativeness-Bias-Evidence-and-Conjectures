{probability: 0.2, assuming that the attacker's height distribution is similar to the local neighborhood's population.}

The question does not provide any additional information that would suggest the attacker's height is more likely to be 185 cm or taller, so we can estimate the probability based on the neighborhood's population distribution. In this case, 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, so the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
