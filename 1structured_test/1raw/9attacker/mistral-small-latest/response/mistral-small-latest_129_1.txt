The information provided does not indicate any specific relation between the attacker and the general population in terms of height. Therefore, the probability should be based on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood.

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
