{probability: 0.20}

Explanation: The question asks for an estimate of the attacker's height, given the information about the neighborhood's height distribution. Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that the attacker has a 20% chance of being 185 cm or taller.
