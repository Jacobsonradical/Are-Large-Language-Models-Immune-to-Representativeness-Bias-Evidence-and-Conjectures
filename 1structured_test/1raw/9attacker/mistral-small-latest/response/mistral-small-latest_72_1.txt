Based on the information provided, the attacker's height could be influenced by the demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. However, without any additional information linking the attacker's height to the neighborhood's demographics, the best estimate would be the same as the general population in the city. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
