{probability: 0.2, The attacker's height is most likely to be representative of the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is estimated that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.2.}
