The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

This is based on the information provided that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. Since we have no other information indicating that taller individuals are more likely to be attackers, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker's height follows the same distribution as the rest of the neighborhood's population.
