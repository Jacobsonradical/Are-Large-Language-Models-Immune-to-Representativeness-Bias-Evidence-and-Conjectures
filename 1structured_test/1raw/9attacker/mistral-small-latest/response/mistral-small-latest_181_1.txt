Probability: 0.2

Explanation: The height of the attacker is not related to the victim's knowledge nor the height distribution of the entire city. The relevant information is the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 20%, which is equal to 0.2 when expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
