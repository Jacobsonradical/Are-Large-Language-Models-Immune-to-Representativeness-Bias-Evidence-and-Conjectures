The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

This is because the height of the attacker is independent of the victim's inability to see the attacker's height. Therefore, we can use the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. In that neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, so our estimate for the probability of the attacker's height is 0.2.
