Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights, with 15% of the population being 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** This information is more specific to the location of the crime.  The fact that the neighborhood has a higher proportion of taller people (20%) than the city average is important.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city-wide distribution. It's more likely the attacker is someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller, there's a higher chance the attacker falls within this group compared to the city average. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
