Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general idea of height distribution but aren't directly applicable to the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information as it reflects the height distribution where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should rely on that information.  We know that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
