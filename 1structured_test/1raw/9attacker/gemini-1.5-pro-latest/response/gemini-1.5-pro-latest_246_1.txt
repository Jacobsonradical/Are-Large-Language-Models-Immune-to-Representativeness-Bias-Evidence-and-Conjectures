Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistic:** This information acts as a baseline but isn't directly useful for a precise calculation. We know the general distribution of heights, but the neighborhood demographics are different.
* **Neighborhood statistic:** This is the crucial information. The attack happened here, so the attacker is more likely to reflect the local height distribution.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since we're interested in the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller *given* that the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, we focus on the neighborhood statistic.

* **20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

While we can't be certain of the attacker's height, the most reasonable estimate for the probability is based on the neighborhood's height distribution. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
