Here's how to approach this problem:

The information about the city's height distribution is not directly relevant to estimating the probability in the specific neighborhood. We should focus on the neighborhood's height distribution.

Given that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred:

* 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm
* 20% of people are 185 cm or taller 

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

**{probability: 0.20}**
