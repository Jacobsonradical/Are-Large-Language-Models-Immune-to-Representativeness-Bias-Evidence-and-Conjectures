Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Key Information:** We're interested in the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller *given* that the attack happened in a specific neighborhood.
* **Base Rate Fallacy:** It's tempting to say the probability is 15% based on the city's average. However, this ignores the crucial information about the neighborhood demographics.
* **Using the Neighborhood Data:** Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize that information.  The neighborhood has a higher proportion of taller people (20%) than the city average.

**Therefore, a more accurate estimate would be closer to the neighborhood's statistic.**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
