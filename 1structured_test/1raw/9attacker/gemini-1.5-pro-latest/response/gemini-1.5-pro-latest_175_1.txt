Here's how we can approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:** The city's population gives us a baseline. There's a 15% chance a random person is 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:** The neighborhood demographics suggest a higher likelihood (20%) of someone being 185cm or taller in that specific area.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it makes more sense to prioritize the neighborhood demographics over the city-wide statistics. 

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate would be closer to the neighborhood's probability.**

**{probability: 0.20}**
