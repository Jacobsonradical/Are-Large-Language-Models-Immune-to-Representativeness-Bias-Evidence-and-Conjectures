Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Citywide Statistics:**  Provide a general distribution of heights but aren't directly useful for this specific crime.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:**  These are crucial because they reflect the height distribution within the pool of potential suspects.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should focus on the neighborhood's height distribution. We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
