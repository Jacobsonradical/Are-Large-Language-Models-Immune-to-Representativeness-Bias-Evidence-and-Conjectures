Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Prior Probability:**  Initially, based on the city's population, there's a 15% chance the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **New Information:** We learn the attack happened in a neighborhood where the probability of someone being 185cm or taller is higher (20%) than the city average.
* **Updating our Belief:** While we should consider the new information, we shouldn't completely disregard the city-wide statistics. The attacker could be from outside the neighborhood.

Since we don't have enough information to calculate the exact probability, we need to make an estimate.  

**Estimate:**

Given the higher concentration of taller people in the neighborhood, the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is likely higher than the city average of 15%, but lower than the neighborhood's 20%. 

Let's estimate it to be somewhere in between:

**{probability: 0.175}** 

This is just one possible estimate. You could reasonably choose a slightly higher or lower value depending on how much weight you give to the neighborhood information.
