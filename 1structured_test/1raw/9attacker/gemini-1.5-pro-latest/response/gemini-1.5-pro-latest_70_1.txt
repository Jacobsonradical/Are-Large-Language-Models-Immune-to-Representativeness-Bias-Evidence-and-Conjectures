Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:**  This gives us a general idea, but it's less important than the neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is crucial because the attack happened in a specific location where the height distribution is different from the city average.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution. We're told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
