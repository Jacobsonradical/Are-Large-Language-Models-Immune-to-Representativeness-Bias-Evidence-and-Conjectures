Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general idea, but aren't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution within the area of the attack.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should focus on that information:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
