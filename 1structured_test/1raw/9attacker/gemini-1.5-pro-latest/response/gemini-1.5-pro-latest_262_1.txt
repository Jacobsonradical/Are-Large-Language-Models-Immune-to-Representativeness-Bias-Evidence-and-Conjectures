Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide height distribution:** This information acts as our baseline. It tells us the general likelihood of someone in the city being a certain height.
* **Neighborhood height distribution:** This is more specific and relevant to the case. The attacker was in this neighborhood, so this information is more important than the city-wide data. 

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should rely more heavily on the neighborhood's height distribution.  Therefore, a good estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

**Important Note:**  This is just an estimate. We can't definitively say the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Other factors could be relevant, such as the victim's height and any additional evidence.
