Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This tells us the general height distribution in the city, which acts as our base rate.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is more specific to the situation. The attacker was in this neighborhood, so this information is more relevant.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city's general distribution. 

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was this height is based on that information.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
