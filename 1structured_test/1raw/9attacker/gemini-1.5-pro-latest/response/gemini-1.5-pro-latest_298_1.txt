Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This tells us the general height distribution, which is less relevant to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution where the attack occurred.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution. We're told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
