Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:**  This gives us a general understanding of height distribution but might not be very accurate for our specific situation.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is more relevant since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution than the city average.

**Focusing on Relevant Information**

We should base our probability estimate primarily on the neighborhood data:

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller.**

**Estimating the Probability**

While we don't have perfect information, the best estimate we can make is based on the neighborhood demographics.  Therefore, there's a 20% chance the attacker was 185cm or taller.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
