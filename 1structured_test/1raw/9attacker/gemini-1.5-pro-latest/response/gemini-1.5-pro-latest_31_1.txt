Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** Provide a general baseline but aren't directly useful since we have more specific information.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:**  These are crucial because the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should rely on the neighborhood's height distribution.  We are told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is just a probability based on height distribution.  It doesn't account for other factors that might be relevant to a criminal investigation.
