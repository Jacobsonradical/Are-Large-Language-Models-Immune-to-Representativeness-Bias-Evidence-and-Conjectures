Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistic:**  This gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant than the neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood statistic:** This is the crucial piece of information.  It tells us the height distribution within the specific area where the attack happened.

**Logic**

Since we have specific information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we should prioritize that information over the city-wide average. It's more likely that the attacker is someone from the neighborhood.

**Calculation**

The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is directly given by the neighborhood statistic: 20%.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
