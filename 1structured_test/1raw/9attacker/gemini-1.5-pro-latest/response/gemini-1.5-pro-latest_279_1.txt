Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This provides general information but isn't directly useful for our estimate since we have more specific data about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information.  The attack happened here, and we know the height distribution in this area.

**Calculating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution. We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
