Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide height distribution:**  This provides general information but isn't directly useful for our estimate.
* **Neighborhood height distribution:** This is crucial because it reflects the population more likely to be present during the attack.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution. We're told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
