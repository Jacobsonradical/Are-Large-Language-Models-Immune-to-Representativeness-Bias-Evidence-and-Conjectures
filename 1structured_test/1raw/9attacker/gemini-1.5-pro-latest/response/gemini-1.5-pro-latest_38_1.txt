Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general background but aren't directly useful since we have more specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information. The attacker being from the neighborhood makes this local data relevant.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with the known statistic of 20% of people being 185cm or taller, our best estimate of the attacker being that height is based on that information.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
