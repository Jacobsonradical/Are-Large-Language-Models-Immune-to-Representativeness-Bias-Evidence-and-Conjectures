Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline but aren't directly helpful since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:**  These are crucial. They tell us the height distribution within the relevant population.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution:

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on the neighborhood's demographics.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
