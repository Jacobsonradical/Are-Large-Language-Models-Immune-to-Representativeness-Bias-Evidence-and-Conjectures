Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This gives us general information, but it's less relevant than the neighborhood data.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information because the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should base our estimate on that.  We are told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
