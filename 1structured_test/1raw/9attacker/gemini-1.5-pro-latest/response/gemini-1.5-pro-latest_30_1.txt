Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller. This is our base rate.
* **Neighborhood Specifics:** The neighborhood where the attack happened has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) than the city average.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood known to have a higher percentage of people 185cm or taller, it's more likely the attacker is also from this neighborhood.  Therefore, we should give more weight to the neighborhood's statistics than the city-wide average.

**Estimate**

While we don't have enough information to calculate the exact probability, we can make an educated estimate. Given the higher concentration of taller people in the neighborhood, the probability is likely higher than the city average of 15% but lower than the neighborhood's 20%.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.17} 

**Note:** This is a subjective estimate. You could reasonably choose a probability between 0.15 and 0.20 depending on how much weight you give to the neighborhood demographics.
