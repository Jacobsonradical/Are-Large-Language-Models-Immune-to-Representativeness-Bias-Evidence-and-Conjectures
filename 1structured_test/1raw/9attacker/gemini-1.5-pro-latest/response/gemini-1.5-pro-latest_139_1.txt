Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior belief:** Based on the city's population, there's a 15% chance someone is 185cm or taller.
* **We have new evidence:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher concentration of people 185cm or taller (20%) than the city average.

Since the neighborhood demographics suggest a higher likelihood of someone being 185cm or taller, we should adjust our probability estimate upwards from the city average. However, we don't have enough information to give a precise numerical probability. 

**It's important to avoid these pitfalls:**

* **Assuming the attacker is definitely from the neighborhood:**  We don't know this for sure.
* **Simply stating the neighborhood's 20% figure:** This ignores the city-wide data which is still relevant.

**Conclusion:**

We can't give a precise numerical probability. We can only say:

The probability that the attacker's height was 185cm or taller is likely somewhat higher than 15% but less than 20%, given the available information.
