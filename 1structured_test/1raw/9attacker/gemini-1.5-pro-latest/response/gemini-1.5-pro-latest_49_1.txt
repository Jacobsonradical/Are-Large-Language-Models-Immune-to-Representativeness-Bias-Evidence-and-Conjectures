Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We're focusing on the neighborhood:** The city's overall height distribution is less relevant since we know the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with its own distribution. 
* **The neighborhood information is key:** We're told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller.

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability is based on the neighborhood's demographics.

**{probability: 0.20}**
