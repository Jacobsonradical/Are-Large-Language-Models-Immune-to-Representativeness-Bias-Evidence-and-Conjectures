Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:**  Provides a general distribution of heights, which acts as our prior knowledge.
* **Neighborhood data:**  This is more specific to the situation and should carry more weight in our estimate.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more likely the attacker is someone from that neighborhood. Therefore, the neighborhood data (20% of people are 185cm or taller) is a better indicator than the city-wide average.

**Estimate**

While we don't have perfect information, the most logical estimate is to use the neighborhood statistic.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
