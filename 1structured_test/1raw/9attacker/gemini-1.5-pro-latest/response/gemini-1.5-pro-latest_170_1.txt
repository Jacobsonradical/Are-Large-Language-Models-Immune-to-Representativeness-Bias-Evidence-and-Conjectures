Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:** The city's population gives us a baseline. There's a 15% chance a random person is 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:** The neighborhood's demographics differ from the city average, with a higher percentage (20%) of people being 185cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to use the neighborhood's demographics to estimate the probability. 

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.20}
