Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller. This is our baseline.
* **Neighborhood:** The neighborhood has a higher concentration (20%) of people 185cm or taller. 

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about the neighborhood's height distribution. The city-wide data is less relevant in this specific case.

**Estimate**

While we can't be certain, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood's statistic. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
