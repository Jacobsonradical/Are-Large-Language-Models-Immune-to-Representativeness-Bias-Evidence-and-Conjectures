Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller. This is our base rate.
* **Neighborhood Specifics:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average. 

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to consider the neighborhood's height distribution rather than the entire city's.  The higher concentration of taller people in the neighborhood makes it more likely the attacker was also taller.

**Estimate**

While we don't have enough information to calculate the *exact* probability, we can make an informed estimate.  Given the neighborhood demographics, it's reasonable to assume the probability is higher than the city average of 15% but likely lower than the neighborhood's 20%.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.17} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate.  Other factors could influence the probability, and without more information, we can't be precise.
