Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide probability:**  There's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person in the city is 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood probability:** In the neighborhood of the attack, there's a 20% chance a randomly chosen person is 185cm or taller.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, it's more relevant to consider the neighborhood's height distribution rather than the entire city's. This is because the attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimate**

Given the higher concentration of taller people in the neighborhood (20%), it's more likely the attacker was 185cm or taller compared to a random person from the city.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic estimate, not a definitive conclusion. There's no guarantee the attacker's height fits the neighborhood trend.
