Here's how we can approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:** The city's population gives us a baseline. There's a 15% chance a random person is 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:**  The neighborhood demographics differ from the city average, with a higher percentage (20%) of taller people.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to use the neighborhood's demographics to estimate the probability. 

Therefore:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

We estimate there's a 20% probability the attacker was 185cm or taller.
