Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:** The city's population suggests a 15% chance of someone being 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:** The neighborhood has a higher concentration of taller people (20%). 

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more reliable to use the neighborhood's information.  

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
