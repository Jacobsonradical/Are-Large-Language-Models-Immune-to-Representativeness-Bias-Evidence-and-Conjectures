Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant than the neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the pool of potential attackers in the immediate area.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should rely on that information primarily. We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
