Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:**  Provides a general distribution of heights, but it's less relevant in this specific case.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is crucial because it reflects the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution.  We know that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.  

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is a probability estimate based on available information.  It doesn't guarantee the attacker's height but provides a likelihood based on the neighborhood demographics. Other factors could influence the actual height of the attacker.
