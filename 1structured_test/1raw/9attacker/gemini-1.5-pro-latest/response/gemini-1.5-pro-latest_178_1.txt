Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This gives us general information, but it's less relevant than the neighborhood data.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is crucial because it reflects the population where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should primarily use the neighborhood statistics:

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

While the city's overall statistics matter, the neighborhood data provides a more accurate representation of potential suspects.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
