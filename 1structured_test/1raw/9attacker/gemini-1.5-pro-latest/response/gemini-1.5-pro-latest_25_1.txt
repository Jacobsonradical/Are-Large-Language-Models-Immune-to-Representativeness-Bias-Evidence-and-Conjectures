Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:**  Provide a general distribution of heights but aren't directly useful for this specific crime.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** Give us relevant information about the potential pool of attackers in the area.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about that neighborhood. We know:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller. 

While we don't have definitive proof, it's reasonable to base our estimate on the neighborhood demographics. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
