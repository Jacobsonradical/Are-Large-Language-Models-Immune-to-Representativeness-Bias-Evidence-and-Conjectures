Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This tells us the general height distribution in the city, but it's less relevant since we have specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial piece of information. It tells us that there's a higher concentration of taller people in the neighborhood where the attack happened compared to the city average.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood's statistic of 20%.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
