Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide height distribution:**  This information is less relevant because we know the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution.
* **Neighborhood height distribution:** This is the crucial information. It tells us that there's a higher chance (20%) of encountering someone 185cm or taller in that neighborhood compared to the city average.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution.  Therefore:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate. We cannot definitively say the attacker was 185cm or taller. Other factors could be at play (e.g., the victim's perception of height during the attack).
