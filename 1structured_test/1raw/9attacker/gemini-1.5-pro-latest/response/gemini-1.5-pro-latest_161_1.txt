Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline, but aren't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information because the attack happened in this specific location.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of people are 185cm or taller, the best estimate of the attacker being that height is based on that neighborhood's statistic.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
