Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** Offer more specific information about the area of the crime, making it more relevant to the potential attacker.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city-wide distribution.  It's more likely the attacker is from the immediate area.

**Calculation**

The neighborhood has a 20% chance of its residents being 185cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
