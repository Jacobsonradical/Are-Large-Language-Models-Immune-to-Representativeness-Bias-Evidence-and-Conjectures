Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This provides general information but isn't directly useful for estimating the attacker's height.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial piece of information. It tells us the height distribution within the relevant population.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution.  We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
