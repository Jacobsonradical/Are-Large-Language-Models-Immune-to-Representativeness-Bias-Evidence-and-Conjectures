Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This tells us the general height distribution in the city, but it's less relevant given the specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial piece of information. It tells us that in the area where the attack happened, 20% of people are 185cm or taller.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, and we know the height distribution in that neighborhood, we should base our probability on that.

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Explanation:** There's a 20% chance the attacker was 185cm or taller based on the neighborhood's height distribution.
