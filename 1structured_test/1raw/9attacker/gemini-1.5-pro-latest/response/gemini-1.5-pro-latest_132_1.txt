Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline but aren't directly useful since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with different demographics.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information. We know there's a higher concentration of taller people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our probability on the neighborhood's demographics:

* **20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on this 20%.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
