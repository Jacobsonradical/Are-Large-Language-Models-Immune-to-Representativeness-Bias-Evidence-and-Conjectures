Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This tells us the general height distribution in the city, which is useful background information.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial piece of information. Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, the attacker is more likely to fit the height distribution of that specific area.

**Estimating the Probability**

Given that the neighborhood has a higher concentration of taller people (20% are 185cm or taller) compared to the city average, it's more likely the attacker belongs to this taller group *within the neighborhood*.

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood's statistic.**

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
``` 

**Important Note:** This is a probability estimate based on limited information. It's not possible to definitively determine the attacker's height without further evidence.
