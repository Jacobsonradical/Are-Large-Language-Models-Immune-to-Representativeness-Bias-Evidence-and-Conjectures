Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This provides general information, but isn't directly useful for a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should rely on that information. We are told 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
