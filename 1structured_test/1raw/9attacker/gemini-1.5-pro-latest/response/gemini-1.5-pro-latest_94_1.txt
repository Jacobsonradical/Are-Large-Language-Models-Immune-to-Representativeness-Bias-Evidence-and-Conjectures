Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Citywide Data:** This provides general information but isn't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is the crucial information as it reflects the height distribution within the area where the attack happened. 

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker belonging to this group is aligned with that proportion.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
