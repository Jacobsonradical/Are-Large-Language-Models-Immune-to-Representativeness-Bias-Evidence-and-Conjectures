Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant than the specific neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the population pool from which the attacker likely came.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should focus on that data:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller.

**Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people in that neighborhood who fit that height description.**

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
