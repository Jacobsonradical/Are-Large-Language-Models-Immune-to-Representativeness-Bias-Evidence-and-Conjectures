Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:**  Provides a general distribution of heights, but might not be entirely accurate for the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** More relevant to the situation, giving a higher proportion of taller people.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more logical to base our estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution rather than the city's.  

**Estimation**

The neighborhood data tells us 20% of people in that area are 185 cm or taller. This becomes our primary piece of evidence.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
