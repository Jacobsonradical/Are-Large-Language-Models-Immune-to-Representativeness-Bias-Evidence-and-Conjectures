Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:**  Provides general information but isn't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate of the attacker being that height is based on that neighborhood statistic.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
