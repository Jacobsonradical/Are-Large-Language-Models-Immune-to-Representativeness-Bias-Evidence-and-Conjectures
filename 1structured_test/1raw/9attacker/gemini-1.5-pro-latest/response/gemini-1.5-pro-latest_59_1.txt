Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline, but aren't as relevant as the neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the population mix where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should base our probability on that:

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller.**

**Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is 20% or 0.2.**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.2}
