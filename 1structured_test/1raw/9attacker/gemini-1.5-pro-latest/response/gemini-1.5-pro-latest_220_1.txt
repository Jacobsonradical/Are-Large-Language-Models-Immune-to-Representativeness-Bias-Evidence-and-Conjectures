Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior belief:**  Initially, we know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
* **New evidence:** The attack happened in a neighborhood where the proportion of taller people (20%) is higher than the city average. 
* **Update our belief:**  This new evidence suggests it's slightly more likely the attacker is taller than 185cm, but we shouldn't completely discard the city-wide statistics.

Since we don't have enough information to calculate a precise probability, we need to make an estimate. 

Considering the evidence, the probability should be higher than the city average (15%) but lower than the neighborhood percentage (20%).

**{probability: 0.175}** 

This is a subjective estimate. A more accurate calculation would require additional information and potentially the use of Bayesian reasoning.
