Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This provides general information, which is less relevant than the specific neighborhood data.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information. The attack happened here, so these percentages are more important in determining the likelihood of the attacker's height.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should primarily base our estimate on that:

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller.**

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is **20%**.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
