Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This tells us the general height distribution, but it's less relevant given the specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information. It tells us the height distribution in the area where the attack happened. 

**Estimating the Probability**

Since we know that 20% of people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate of the attacker being this height is based on that information alone.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
