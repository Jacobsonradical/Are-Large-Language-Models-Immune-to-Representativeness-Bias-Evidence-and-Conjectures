Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Focus on the relevant information:** The city's overall height distribution is less important than the neighborhood's distribution where the attack happened. 
* **Use the neighborhood data:** You're told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on the neighborhood's height distribution.**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
