Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We're given base rates:** The city's population height distribution gives us a base rate, but the neighborhood's distribution is more relevant to the specific attack.
* **Focus on the relevant population:** The attack happened in the neighborhood, so we should focus on the fact that 20% of people in *that neighborhood* are 185cm or taller. 

Since we don't have any other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the attacker being 185cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are that height.

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.20}
