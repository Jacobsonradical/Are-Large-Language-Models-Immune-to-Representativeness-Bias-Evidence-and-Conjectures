Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistic:**  This information acts as a baseline, but isn't directly the most useful for our estimate.
* **Neighborhood statistic:** This information is crucial because it reflects the population pool from which the attacker is more likely to have come.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city's general distribution.

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was this height is:

**{probability: 0.20}**
