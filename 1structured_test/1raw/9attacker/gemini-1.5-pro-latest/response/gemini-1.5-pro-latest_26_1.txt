Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We're focusing on the neighborhood:** The city's overall height distribution is less relevant because we know the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with its own distribution.
* **Use the neighborhood data:**  The neighborhood has a 20% chance that a randomly chosen person would be 185 cm or taller.  

While we don't have definitive proof, the best estimate of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is based on the neighborhood's demographics.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
