Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This information acts as our baseline.  It tells us the general distribution of heights in the city.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is more specific and relevant to our case. It tells us the height distribution within the area where the attack happened.

**Focusing on Relevant Data**

Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city's general distribution. 

**Calculating the Probability**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is directly given by the neighborhood statistic: 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
