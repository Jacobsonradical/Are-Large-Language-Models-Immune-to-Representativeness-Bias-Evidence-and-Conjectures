Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general idea but aren't directly applicable to the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution in the area where the attack occurred.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should focus on the neighborhood's height distribution.  We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
