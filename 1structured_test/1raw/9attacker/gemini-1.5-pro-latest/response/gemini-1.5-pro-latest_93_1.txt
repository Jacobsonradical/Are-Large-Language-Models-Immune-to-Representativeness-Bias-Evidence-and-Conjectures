Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Statistics:** This provides general information but isn't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information. The attacker is more likely to be from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should rely on that information. In this neighborhood:

* 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, our best estimate of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is based on the neighborhood's demographics. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
