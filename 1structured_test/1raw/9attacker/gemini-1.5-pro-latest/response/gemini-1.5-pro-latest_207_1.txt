Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline, but aren't directly useful for our estimate.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is crucial. The attack happened here, so these percentages are much more relevant.

**Making the Estimate**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller.

While we don't have definitive proof, the most logical estimate is to use the neighborhood information:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate. We are assuming the attacker is someone from the neighborhood, which might not be true.
