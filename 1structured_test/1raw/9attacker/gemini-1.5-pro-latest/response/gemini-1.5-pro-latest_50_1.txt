Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline, but aren't directly useful since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** These are crucial. They tell us the height distribution within the relevant population.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution.  Therefore:

* There's a 20% chance the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
