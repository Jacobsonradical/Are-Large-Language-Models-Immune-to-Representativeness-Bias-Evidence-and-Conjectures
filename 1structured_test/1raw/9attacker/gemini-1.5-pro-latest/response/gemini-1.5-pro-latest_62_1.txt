Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Citywide Statistics:**  Provide a general background but aren't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information.  The attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185cm or taller, it's reasonable to use this percentage as our estimate. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
