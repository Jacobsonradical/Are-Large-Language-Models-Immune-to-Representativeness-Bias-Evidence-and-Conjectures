Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:**  Provide a general distribution of heights, but aren't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution within the relevant population.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should focus on the neighborhood's height distribution:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on this neighborhood statistic.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
