Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Provides a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood data:**  More specific to the situation and should be given more weight.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize that information. The city-wide data is less relevant in this case.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Explanation:**  The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20 (or 20%) based on the neighborhood's height distribution.
