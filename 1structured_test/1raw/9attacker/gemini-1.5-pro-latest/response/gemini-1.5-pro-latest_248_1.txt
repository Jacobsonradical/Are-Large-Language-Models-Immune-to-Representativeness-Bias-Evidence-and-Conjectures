Here's how we can approach this problem:

Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about that neighborhood over the city's general statistics.  

The neighborhood has a higher proportion of taller people (20%) compared to the city average (15%). While we don't have definitive proof, it's more likely the attacker came from the neighborhood itself.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood's statistic.

**{probability: 0.20}**
