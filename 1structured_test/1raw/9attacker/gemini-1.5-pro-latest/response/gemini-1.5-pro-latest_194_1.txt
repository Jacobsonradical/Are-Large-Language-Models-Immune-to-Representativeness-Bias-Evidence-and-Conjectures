Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This information is less relevant because we know the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information. It tells us that there's a higher chance (20%) of encountering someone 185cm or taller in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

**Important Note:**  This is just an estimate based on the given information. It doesn't guarantee the attacker's actual height. Other factors could be relevant in an investigation, such as witness statements or forensic evidence.
