Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** Offer more specific information about the area where the attack happened. This local information is likely more relevant to the potential attacker's profile.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it's more reasonable to base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution rather than the city's.

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**  There's a 20% probability (or 0.2) that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood demographics.
