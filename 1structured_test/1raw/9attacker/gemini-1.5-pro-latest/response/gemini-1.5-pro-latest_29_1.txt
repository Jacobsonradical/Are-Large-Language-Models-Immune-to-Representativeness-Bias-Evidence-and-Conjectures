Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  85% shorter than 185cm, 15% 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** 80% shorter than 185cm, 20% 185cm or taller.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, the neighborhood's height distribution is more relevant than the city-wide distribution. We should base our estimate on the fact that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185cm or taller.

**Estimate**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:**  This is a probability estimate based on the available information. It doesn't mean the attacker was definitely 185cm or taller. Other factors could be relevant in an investigation.
