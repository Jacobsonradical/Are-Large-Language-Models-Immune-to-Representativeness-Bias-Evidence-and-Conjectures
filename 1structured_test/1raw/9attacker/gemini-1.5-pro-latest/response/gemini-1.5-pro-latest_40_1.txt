Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:** This acts as our base rate. It tells us the general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is more specific and relevant to our case. The attacker was in this neighborhood, making this information more important.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city-wide data. The neighborhood has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average (15%). 

**Estimate**

While we can't be certain, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood's statistic.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
