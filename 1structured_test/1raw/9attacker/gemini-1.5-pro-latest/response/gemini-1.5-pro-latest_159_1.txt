Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** Provide a general baseline, but aren't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is crucial. The attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should rely on that information.  We are told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
