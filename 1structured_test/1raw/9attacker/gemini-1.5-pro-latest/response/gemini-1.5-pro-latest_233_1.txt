Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Focus on the relevant population:** The city's overall height distribution is less important than the distribution within the neighborhood where the attack happened.
* **Use the neighborhood information:** You're given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

Therefore, based on the information provided, the best estimate of the probability is:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

This means there's a 20% chance the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood demographics.
