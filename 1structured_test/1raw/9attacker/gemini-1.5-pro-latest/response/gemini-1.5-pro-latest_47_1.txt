Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller. This is our base rate.
* **Neighborhood Specifics:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher concentration (20%) of people 185cm or taller.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood with a higher proportion of taller people, it's reasonable to assume the probability that the attacker is 185cm or taller is slightly higher than the city-wide average. 

**Estimate**

While we don't have enough information to calculate a precise probability, we can make an educated estimate.  Given the neighborhood demographics, a reasonable estimate would be slightly above the city average.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.18
}
``` 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate. We're leaning towards a higher probability because of the neighborhood information, but many other factors could influence the attacker's height.
