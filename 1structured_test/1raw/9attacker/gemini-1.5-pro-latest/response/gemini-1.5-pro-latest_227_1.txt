Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistic:**  This gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant than the specific neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood statistic:** This is the crucial piece of information. It tells us the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should base our estimate on that. We're told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on the given information.  We cannot definitively say the attacker was 185 cm or taller with 100% certainty. Other factors could be involved, and eyewitness testimony is often unreliable.
