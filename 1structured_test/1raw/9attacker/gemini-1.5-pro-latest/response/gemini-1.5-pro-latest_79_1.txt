Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This information acts as our base rate or prior probability. It tells us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This information is more specific and likely to be more relevant to the attack. It tells us the likelihood of someone *in the area of the attack* being 185cm or taller.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city-wide distribution. This is because the attacker was more likely to be someone from the neighborhood than a random person from anywhere in the city.

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller, our estimate of the attacker being 185cm or taller is higher than the city-wide average.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
