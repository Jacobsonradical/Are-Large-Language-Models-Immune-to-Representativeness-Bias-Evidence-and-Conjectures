Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Statistics:**  Represent the general population distribution.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** Provide specific information about the area where the attack occurred, making it more relevant to the case.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood statistics over the city-wide statistics. This is because the attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood than a random person from the city.

**Calculation**

The neighborhood statistics tell us that 20% of people in that area are 185 cm or taller. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
