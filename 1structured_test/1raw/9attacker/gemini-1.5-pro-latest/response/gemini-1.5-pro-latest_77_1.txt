Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This gives us a general idea, but isn't directly applicable to the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information.  The attacker is more likely to be from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood statistics:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability is based on that neighborhood information.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20
}
```
