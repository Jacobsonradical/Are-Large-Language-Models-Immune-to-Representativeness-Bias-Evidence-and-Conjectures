Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** Provide a general baseline but aren't directly useful since the attack was localized.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information. The attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood statistics:

* There's a 20% chance the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood demographics.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
