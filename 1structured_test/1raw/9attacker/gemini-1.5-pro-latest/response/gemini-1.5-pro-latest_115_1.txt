Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This gives us general information but isn't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial piece of information, as it reflects the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since we're interested in the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller *given* that the attack happened in this particular neighborhood, we focus on the neighborhood's height distribution.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.2} 

There is a 20% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood demographics.
