Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:** The city's population suggests a 15% chance of a random person being 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:** The neighborhood demographics show a higher concentration (20%) of people 185cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to use the neighborhood demographics than the city-wide statistics.  Therefore, our estimate should be closer to the neighborhood data.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20} 

It's important to note that this is still an estimate. We're assuming the attacker is someone from the neighborhood, which might not be the case.
