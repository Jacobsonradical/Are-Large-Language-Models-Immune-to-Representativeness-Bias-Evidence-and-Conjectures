Here's how we can approach this problem:

The prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller is 15%. However, we know the attack occurred in a neighborhood where the probability of someone being 185cm or taller is higher (20%).  

Since the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about the neighborhood's height distribution over the city's overall distribution.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability is closer to the neighborhood's statistic.

**{probability: 0.20}**
