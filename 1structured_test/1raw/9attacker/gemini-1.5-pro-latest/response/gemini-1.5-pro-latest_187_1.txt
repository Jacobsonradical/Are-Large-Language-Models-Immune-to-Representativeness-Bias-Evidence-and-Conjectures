Here's how to approach this problem:

The information about the city's height distribution is less relevant than the specific information about the neighborhood. Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should focus on that data.

**Given:**

* In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185cm or taller.

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.20} 

There is a 20% probability that the attacker's height was 185cm or taller.
