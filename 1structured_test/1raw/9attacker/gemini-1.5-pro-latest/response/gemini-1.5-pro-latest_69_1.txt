Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Focus on the relevant information:** The key piece of information is the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.  We are interested in the probability of the attacker being from the subset of people who are 185cm or taller *within that neighborhood*.
* **Use the neighborhood data:**  The problem states that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller. 

Therefore, the estimate of the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
