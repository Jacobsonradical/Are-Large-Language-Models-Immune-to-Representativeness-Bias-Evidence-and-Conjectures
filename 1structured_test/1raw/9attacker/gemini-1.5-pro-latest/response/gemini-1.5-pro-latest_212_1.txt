Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This information acts as our baseline.  It tells us the general distribution of heights in the city.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is more specific and relevant to our case.  It tells us the height distribution within the area where the attack occurred.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city's general distribution.  The neighborhood information gives us a more focused probability pool.

**Calculation**

The problem tells us that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
