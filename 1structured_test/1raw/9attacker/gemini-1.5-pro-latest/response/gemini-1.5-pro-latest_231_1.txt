Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We're dealing with conditional probability:**  We want to know the probability someone is 185cm or taller *given* they were the attacker in this neighborhood.
* **The neighborhood information is crucial:**  The overall city statistics are less relevant than the specific demographics of the neighborhood where the attack happened.

Since 20% of people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185cm or taller, our best estimate of the attacker being that height is based on that percentage.

**{probability: 0.20}**
