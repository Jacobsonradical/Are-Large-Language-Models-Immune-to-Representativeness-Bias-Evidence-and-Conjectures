Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** This gives us general information, but it's less relevant than the specific neighborhood data.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is crucial. The attack happened here, so this is the relevant population. 

**Calculating the Probability**

Since we're focusing on the neighborhood where the attack occurred, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is directly given by the neighborhood data:

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
