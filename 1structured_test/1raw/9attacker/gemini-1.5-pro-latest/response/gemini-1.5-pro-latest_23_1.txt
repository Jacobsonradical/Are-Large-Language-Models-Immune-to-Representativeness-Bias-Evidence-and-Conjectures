Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline but aren't directly useful for this specific crime.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information. The attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should focus on the neighborhood's height distribution.  In the neighborhood:

* 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
