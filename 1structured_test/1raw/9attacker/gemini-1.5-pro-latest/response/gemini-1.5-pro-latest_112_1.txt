Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:** This provides general information, but isn't directly useful for our estimate.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is crucial. The attack happened here, so this data is more relevant.

**Making the Estimate**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood data:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

While the city-wide data isn't useless (it tells us the neighborhood skews slightly taller), it shouldn't drastically change our estimate.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on limited information.  There's no guarantee the attacker fits the neighborhood's height distribution.
