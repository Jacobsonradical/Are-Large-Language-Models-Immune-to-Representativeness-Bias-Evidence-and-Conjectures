Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights but aren't directly useful for this specific crime.
* **Neighborhood statistics:**  More relevant because the attack occurred there, giving a higher concentration of taller people.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should focus on that information.  

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on this neighborhood statistic.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
