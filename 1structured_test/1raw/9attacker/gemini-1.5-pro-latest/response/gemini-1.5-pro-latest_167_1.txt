Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior belief:**  Initially, we know that 15% of the city's population is 185cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
* **We have new information:** The attack happened in a neighborhood where the percentage of taller people (20%) is higher than the city average.
* **We need to update our belief:**  Given this new information, it's more likely the attacker is taller than the average person in the city.

While we can't calculate the exact probability without more information, a reasonable estimate should be higher than the initial 15% but lower than 20% (since the city average still plays a role).

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate would be:**

{probability: 0.175} 

**Important Note:** This is a subjective estimate. A more precise calculation would require applying Bayesian reasoning or having additional information about the crime and the neighborhood.
