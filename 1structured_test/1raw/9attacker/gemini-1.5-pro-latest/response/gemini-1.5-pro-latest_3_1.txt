Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** Offer more specific information about the potential attacker pool since the attack happened in that neighborhood.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about that neighborhood over the general city-wide statistics.  

**Estimation**

The neighborhood has a 20% chance that a randomly chosen person would be 185cm or taller. While we don't know for sure the attacker's height, this neighborhood statistic gives us the best estimate.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
