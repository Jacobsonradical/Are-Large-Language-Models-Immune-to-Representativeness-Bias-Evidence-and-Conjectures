Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Statistics:**  Provide a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** Give a more specific distribution relevant to the crime scene. 

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, the neighborhood statistics are more relevant than the city-wide statistics. It's more likely the attacker is someone who lives in or frequents the area.

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, there's a higher chance the attacker belongs to this group compared to the city-wide average.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
