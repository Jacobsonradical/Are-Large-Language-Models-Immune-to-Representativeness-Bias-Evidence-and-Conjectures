Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Provides a general distribution of height, which acts as our prior knowledge.
* **Neighborhood data:**  Offers more specific information about the area where the attack happened. This is more relevant to estimating the attacker's height.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the general city data.  

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Explanation**

There's a 20% chance the attacker was 185cm or taller based on the neighborhood demographics. While the city-wide data is useful, the neighborhood information is more directly applicable to the situation.
