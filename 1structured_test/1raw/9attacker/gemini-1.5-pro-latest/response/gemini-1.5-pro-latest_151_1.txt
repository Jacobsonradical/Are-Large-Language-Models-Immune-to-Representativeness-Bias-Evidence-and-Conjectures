Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller. This is our base rate.
* **Neighborhood:** The attack happened in a neighborhood where the proportion of taller people (20%) is higher than the city average. 

**Logic**

Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood with a higher concentration of people 185cm or taller, the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller increases.  We don't know how much it increases, but it's more likely than the city average.

**Estimation**

We need to estimate a probability between 0.15 (the city average) and 0.20 (the neighborhood proportion). A reasonable estimate might be slightly closer to the neighborhood proportion since that's the more specific information we have about the location of the attack.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.18 
}
```

**Important Note:** This is an estimate. Without more information, we can't calculate the exact probability.  Factors like time of day and the victim's usual routines could influence the likelihood of encountering someone taller.
