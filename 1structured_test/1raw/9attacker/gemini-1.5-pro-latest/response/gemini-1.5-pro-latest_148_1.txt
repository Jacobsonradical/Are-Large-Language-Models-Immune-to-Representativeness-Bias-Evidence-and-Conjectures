Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This gives us general information, but it's less relevant than the neighborhood data.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information because it reflects the population the attacker likely came from.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should primarily use the neighborhood's height distribution.  Therefore:

* There is a 20% chance the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
