Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** Provide a general baseline, but aren't directly useful since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution within the relevant population.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution:

* **20% of the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.** 

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20
}
```
