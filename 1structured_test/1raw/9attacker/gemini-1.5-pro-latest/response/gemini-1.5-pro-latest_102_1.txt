Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant than the specific neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial piece of information. We know that in the area where the attack happened, 20% of people are 185cm or taller.

**Making the Estimate**

Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the probability that they were 185cm or taller is based directly on the neighborhood's height distribution.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
``` 

**Important Note:** This is just a statistical probability based on limited information. It doesn't mean the attacker was definitely 185cm or taller. Other factors could be relevant, and eyewitness testimony (if available) should be prioritized.
