Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Provides general information but isn't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is crucial because the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood. 

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should rely on that information. We are told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
