Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general background but aren't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** These are crucial. They tell us the height distribution within the area where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution:

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

Therefore, the estimate of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is directly based on this neighborhood statistic.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
