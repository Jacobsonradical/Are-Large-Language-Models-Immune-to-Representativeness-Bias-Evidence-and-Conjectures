Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistic:**  This gives us general information, but it's less relevant to the specific neighborhood of the attack.
* **Neighborhood statistic:** This is the crucial piece of information. It tells us the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since we're interested in the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller *given* the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, we focus on the neighborhood statistic.

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

While we don't have any further information about the attacker, the best estimate we can make is based on the height distribution in the neighborhood. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
