Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This tells us the general height distribution, but it's less relevant given the specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information. It tells us the height distribution within the area where the attack occurred. 

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should rely on that information. We are told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
