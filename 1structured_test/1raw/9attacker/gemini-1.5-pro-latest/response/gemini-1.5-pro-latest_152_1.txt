Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** Give a more specific distribution relevant to the crime scene. 

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about that neighborhood over the general city statistics. This is because the attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood than a random person from the city.

**Calculation**

The neighborhood statistics tell us that 20% of people in that area are 185 cm or taller. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
