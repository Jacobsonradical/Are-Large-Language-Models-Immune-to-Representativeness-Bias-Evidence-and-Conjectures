Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  85% shorter than 185cm, 15% 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** 80% shorter than 185cm, 20% 185cm or taller.

**Key Insight**

The attack happened in the neighborhood, not just randomly in the city.  Therefore, the neighborhood's height distribution is more relevant than the city's.

**Estimate**

Since the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people 185cm or taller (20%) compared to the city average (15%), it's more likely the attacker belongs to that taller group *given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood*. 

While we don't have enough information to calculate a precise probability, a reasonable estimate should be higher than the city average but lower than the neighborhood percentage. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate.  Other factors could influence the attacker's height, and we don't have enough information to be definitive.
