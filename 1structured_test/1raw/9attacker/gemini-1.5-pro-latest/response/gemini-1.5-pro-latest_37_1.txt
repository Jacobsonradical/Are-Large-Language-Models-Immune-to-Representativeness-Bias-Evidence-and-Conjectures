Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We're given base rates:** The city's height distribution (85% shorter, 15% taller) acts as our base rate.
* **We have specific information:** The neighborhood's height distribution (80% shorter, 20% taller) is more relevant to the potential attacker.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more logical to prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the general city's distribution.

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability is:**

{probability: 0.20} 

This means there's an estimated 20% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the neighborhood demographics.
