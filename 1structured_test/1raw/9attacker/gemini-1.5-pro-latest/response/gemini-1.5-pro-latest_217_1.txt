Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline but aren't directly useful since the attack was localized.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** These are crucial because they reflect the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since we have specific information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we should rely on that data. The fact that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller is the most relevant information.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
