Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant than the neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial piece of information because the attack happened in this specific neighborhood.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with a known height distribution (80% shorter, 20% taller than 185 cm), we should base our probability on that information.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Explanation**

There is a 20% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the height distribution within the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
