Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This information acts as a baseline. It tells us the general distribution of heights in the city.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is more relevant to the case. It gives us the height distribution within the specific area where the attack happened.

**Focusing on Relevant Data**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood statistics over the city-wide statistics.

**Calculation**

The neighborhood statistics state that 20% of people in that area are 185 cm or taller.  

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
