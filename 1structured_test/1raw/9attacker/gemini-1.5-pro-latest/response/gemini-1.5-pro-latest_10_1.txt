Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** This acts as our base rate. It tells us the general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is more specific information related to the area of the crime. It suggests a higher concentration of taller people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood data over the city-wide data. This is because the attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, there's a higher chance the attacker falls within this group. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is a probability estimate, not a definitive answer.  Without more information, we can't be certain of the attacker's height.
