Here's how we can approach this problem:

* **Prior Information:** Initially, we know that 15% of the city's population is 185cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
* **New Information:**  The attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185cm or taller. This is a higher concentration than the city average.

Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood with a higher concentration of taller people, it's more likely the attacker was also taller. We should adjust our probability estimate upwards from the 15% city average, to be closer to the 20% neighborhood rate.

**It's important to note:** We cannot definitively say the probability IS 20%.  The attacker could still be from outside the neighborhood. 

**Estimate:**  We need to provide a number between 0 and 1 to represent the probability. 

Let's estimate the probability to be **0.18**. This represents an increase from the city average, reflecting the neighborhood information, without completely dismissing the possibility the attacker was from elsewhere. 

**Answer:** {probability: 0.18}
