Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** Offer more specific information about the area where the attack occurred. 
* **Key point:** The neighborhood statistics are more relevant in this case because we want to narrow down the possibilities based on where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should prioritize that information.  Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker falls into this category is higher than the city average.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
