Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant than the neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is crucial.  The attack happened here, so this is the relevant population pool.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should focus on that:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller.

**Therefore, our best estimate of the attacker being 185cm or taller is simply the neighborhood proportion:**

**{probability: 0.20}**
