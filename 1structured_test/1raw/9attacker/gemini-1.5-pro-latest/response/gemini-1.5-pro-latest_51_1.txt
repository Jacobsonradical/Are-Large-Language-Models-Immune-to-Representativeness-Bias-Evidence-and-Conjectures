Here's how to approach this problem:

The key piece of information is the height distribution in the *neighborhood* where the attack occurred. We know that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185cm or taller.  

Since the attack happened in that neighborhood, and we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the attacker being 185cm or taller is simply the percentage of people that height in that neighborhood.

Therefore:

{probability: 0.20}
