Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  This gives us general information but isn't directly useful for our estimate.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information. The attack happened here, so we need to focus on the neighborhood's height distribution.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185cm or taller, our best estimate of the attacker being that height is based on that neighborhood information.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
