Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** This acts as our base rate. It tells us the general distribution of height in the population.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is more specific and likely more relevant to the case. The attacker was in this neighborhood, making this information more valuable.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about that neighborhood over the general city data.  The higher concentration of people taller than 185cm in the neighborhood suggests a higher probability the attacker also fits that description.

**Estimate**

While we can't be certain, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller should be closer to the neighborhood statistic (20%) than the city-wide statistic (15%). 

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
``` 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate.  Other factors could influence the attacker's height, and we don't have enough information to be definitive.
