Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:** This acts as our base rate. It tells us the general distribution of heights in the city.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is more specific information related to the crime.  It tells us the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood data over the city-wide data.  The neighborhood information gives us a more relevant probability distribution for potential suspects.

**Calculation**

We are given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller.  

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
