Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights but are less relevant to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood statistics:**  More important! This tells us the height distribution within the area where the attack happened.

**Focusing on the Relevant Information**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should primarily rely on the neighborhood's height distribution. We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**The Estimate**

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the percentage of people in the neighborhood who fit that description.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
