Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:** This acts as our base rate. It tells us the general distribution of heights in the city.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is more specific to our situation. The attack happened in this neighborhood, so this information is more relevant than the city-wide data.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood data:

*  The neighborhood has a 20% chance of a randomly selected person being 185 cm or taller. 

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%.**

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20
}
```
