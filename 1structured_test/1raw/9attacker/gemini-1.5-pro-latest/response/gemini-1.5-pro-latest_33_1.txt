Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:**  The city's population gives us a starting point. There's a 15% chance a random person from the city is 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:**  The neighborhood demographics differ from the city average. This new information suggests a higher likelihood (20%) that someone in the neighborhood is 185cm or taller. 

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about the neighborhood's height distribution. 

**Therefore, our estimate should be closer to the neighborhood's percentage.**

**{probability: 0.20}** 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimation.  Realistically, other factors could influence the probability, such as:

* The victim's own height (could make it harder to determine if the attacker was taller)
* The time of night and presence of potential witnesses (could impact the pool of potential suspects)
