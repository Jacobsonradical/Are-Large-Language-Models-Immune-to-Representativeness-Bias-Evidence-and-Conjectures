Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood statistics:**  Offer more specific information about potential attackers in the area where the crime occurred. Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, this information is more relevant than the city-wide data.

**Estimating the Probability**

Given that the neighborhood has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average (15%), it's more likely the attacker was 185 cm or taller than if the attack had happened elsewhere in the city.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability should be higher than the neighborhood average of 20% but not drastically higher.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.3} 

**Important Note:** This is still an estimate. Without more information about the attack or potential suspects, we can't definitively say the attacker's height.
