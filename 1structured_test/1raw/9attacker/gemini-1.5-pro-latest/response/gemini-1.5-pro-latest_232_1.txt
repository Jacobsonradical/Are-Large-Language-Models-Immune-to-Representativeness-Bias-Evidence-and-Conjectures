Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** This information acts as a baseline, but it's less relevant given the specific details about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is the crucial information because the attack happened in this specific location.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller,  it's reasonable to use this percentage as our estimate.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
``` 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimate.  In reality, other factors could influence the probability, such as the time of day (were taller people more likely to be out at that time?), any additional witness statements, or other evidence found at the scene.
