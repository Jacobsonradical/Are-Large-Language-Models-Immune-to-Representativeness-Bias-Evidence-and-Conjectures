Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This gives us a general idea, but isn't directly useful for a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information. The attacker is more likely to be from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it's more likely that the attacker belongs to this group compared to the general city population. 

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability is higher than the city average but not excessively so.**

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimate.  In a real investigation, factors like time of day (were taller people more likely to be out at that time?), witness statements (even if they couldn't see height, maybe they noticed build), and other evidence would be considered.
