Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** This acts as our base rate. It tells us the general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is more specific to our situation and suggests the attacker is more likely to be from the neighborhood than randomly selected from the entire city. 

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood where taller people are more common (20%) than in the city as a whole (15%), it's more likely the attacker was 185cm or taller than the city average would suggest.

**Estimate**

While we can't be exact, a reasonable estimate would be closer to the neighborhood percentage than the city percentage.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate. Other factors could influence the attacker's height, and we have limited information.
