Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller. This is our baseline probability.
* **Neighborhood:** The neighborhood has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more likely that the attacker is from that neighborhood.  Therefore, we should adjust our probability estimate based on the neighborhood demographics.

**Estimate**

While we don't have enough information to calculate the exact probability, it's reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is higher than the city average (15%) but lower than the neighborhood percentage (20%).  

A reasonable estimate might be somewhere around the middle of those two percentages.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.175}
