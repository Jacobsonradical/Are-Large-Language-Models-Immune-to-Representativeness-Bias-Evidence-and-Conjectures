Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general idea of height distribution but aren't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should rely on the neighborhood statistics:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Therefore, our best estimate of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is based on the neighborhood information.**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
