Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:** This provides general information, but it's less relevant to the specific attack.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is crucial because the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution than the city as a whole.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on that neighborhood statistic.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
