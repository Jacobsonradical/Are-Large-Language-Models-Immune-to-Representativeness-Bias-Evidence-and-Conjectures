Here's how to approach this problem:

The information about the city's overall height distribution is less relevant than the specific information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. We should focus on the neighborhood data.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with a known distribution, we'll base our estimate on that.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Explanation:**

There is a 20% chance the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood's height distribution.
