Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This information is less relevant since we know the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information.  There's a 20% chance that a randomly chosen person from this neighborhood would be 185 cm or taller.

**Estimating the Probability**

Given that we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are that height.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
