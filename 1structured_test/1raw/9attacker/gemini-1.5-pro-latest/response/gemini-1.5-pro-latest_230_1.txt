Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant than the specific neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial piece of information. It tells us the height distribution within the pool of potential attackers.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should base our estimate on that.  

* We know that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20% or 0.2.**

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.2
}
```
