Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** In the general population, there's a 15% chance of someone being 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** The neighborhood where the attack happened has a higher concentration of taller people (20%).

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood statistics over the general city statistics.  

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood's percentage.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
