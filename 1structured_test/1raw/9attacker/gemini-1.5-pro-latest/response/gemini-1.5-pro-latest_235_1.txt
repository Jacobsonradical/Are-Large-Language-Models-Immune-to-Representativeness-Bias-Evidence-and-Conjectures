Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Focus on the relevant information:** The key piece of information is the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. The city-wide statistics are less relevant.
* **Use the neighborhood data:** In the neighborhood:
    * 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
    * 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we have no other information about the attacker, our best estimate of the probability is based on the neighborhood demographics. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
