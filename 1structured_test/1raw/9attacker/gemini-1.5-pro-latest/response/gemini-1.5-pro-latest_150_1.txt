Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This provides general information but isn't directly useful for a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should rely on the neighborhood's height distribution.  We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on the available information. It assumes the attacker is randomly drawn from the neighborhood population. Other factors (e.g., if the victim mentioned the attacker seemed particularly tall) could influence the probability.
