Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  85% shorter than 185cm, 15% 185cm or taller. This acts as our base rate.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** 80% shorter than 185cm, 20% 185cm or taller. This is more specific information related to the crime.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city's general distribution. 

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller, there's a higher likelihood the attacker belongs to this group compared to the city average.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
