Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Provides general information about height distribution but might not be directly relevant to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is more useful as it reflects the height distribution where the attack occurred.

**Making the Estimate**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution.  We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
