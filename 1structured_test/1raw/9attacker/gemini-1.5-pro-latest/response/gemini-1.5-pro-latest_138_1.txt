Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:**  Provide a general baseline but aren't directly applicable to the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood statistics:**  More relevant as they reflect the height distribution within the area of the attack.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should rely on the neighborhood's height distribution. We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
