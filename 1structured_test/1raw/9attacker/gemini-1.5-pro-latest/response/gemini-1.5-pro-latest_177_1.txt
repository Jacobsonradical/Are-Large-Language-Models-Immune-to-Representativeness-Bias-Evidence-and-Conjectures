Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Statistics:** This information acts as a baseline. We know that in the general population of the city, taller people (185cm or more) are less common.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is more specific to the crime and therefore more useful. The neighborhood has a higher concentration of taller people than the city average.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood statistics. The higher percentage of people taller than 185cm in the neighborhood suggests a higher probability that the attacker also belongs to this group compared to the city average.

**Estimate**

While we cannot be certain, a reasonable estimate should be higher than the neighborhood average of 20% but lower than 100%. This is because we're making an educated guess based on the available information.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.35} 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible estimate. You could choose a different probability within a reasonable range. The key is to justify your reasoning based on the given data.
