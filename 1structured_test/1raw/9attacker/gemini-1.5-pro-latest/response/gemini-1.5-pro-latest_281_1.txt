Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller. This is our base rate.
* **Neighborhood Specifics:** The neighborhood where the attack happened has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) than the city average.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood known to have a higher proportion of taller people, it's more likely the attacker was 185cm or taller than the city average would suggest. However, we don't have enough information to definitively say.

**Estimate**

We need to make an estimate based on the available information.  A reasonable approach is to adjust our probability upwards, closer to the neighborhood's 20% but not exceeding it. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.18} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate.  We're making an educated guess based on limited information.  The actual probability could be higher or lower.
