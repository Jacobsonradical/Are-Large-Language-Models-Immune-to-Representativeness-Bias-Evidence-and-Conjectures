Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general idea but aren't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood statistics:**  These are crucial, as the attack happened in this specific location.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of people are 185 cm or taller,  we should base our estimate on this information.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is a probability estimate based on the available information. It does not guarantee the attacker's height. Other factors could be relevant, such as eyewitness testimonies (if any) or other evidence.
