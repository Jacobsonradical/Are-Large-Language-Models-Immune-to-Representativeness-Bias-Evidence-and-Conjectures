Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:** The city's population gives us a baseline. There's a 15% chance a random person would be 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:** The neighborhood's demographics differ from the city average, with a higher proportion (20%) of taller individuals.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to use the neighborhood's demographics.  

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability is closer to the neighborhood's statistic.**

**{probability: 0.20}**
