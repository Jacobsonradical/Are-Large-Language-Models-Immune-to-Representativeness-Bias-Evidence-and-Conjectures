Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline but aren't directly the most useful information in this specific case.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information. The attack happened here, so these percentages are more relevant.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should primarily base our probability on that information.  

* **In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185cm or taller.**

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is 20%.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
