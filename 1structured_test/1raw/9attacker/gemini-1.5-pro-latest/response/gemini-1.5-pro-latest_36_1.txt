Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline but aren't directly useful for this specific attack.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information. The attack occurred here, so these percentages are more relevant.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should focus on that information:

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

This percentage is our best estimate of the probability.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
