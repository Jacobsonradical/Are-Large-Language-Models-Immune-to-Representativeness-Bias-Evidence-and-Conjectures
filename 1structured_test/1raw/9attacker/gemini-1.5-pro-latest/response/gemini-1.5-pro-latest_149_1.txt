Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline but aren't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** These are crucial because the attack happened in this specific area.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should rely on that information. The city-wide statistics become less relevant.

**Calculation**

The neighborhood has a 20% chance that a randomly chosen person is 185cm or taller.  While we don't know anything else about the attacker, this is the best estimate we can make with the given information.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
