Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:** This acts as our base rate or prior knowledge. It tells us the general distribution of heights in the city.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is more specific information related to the crime scene. It suggests that the attacker is more likely to be from the neighborhood than a random person from the entire city.

**Using Bayesian Reasoning (Intuitively)**

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood where taller people are more common (20%) than in the city overall (15%), our estimate of the attacker being 185 cm or taller should be higher than 15% but lower than 20%.

**Without a precise Bayesian calculation, we can give an estimated probability range:**

The probability likely falls between 15% and 20%.  

**Answer (Estimate):**

{probability: 0.175} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate. A more precise answer would require applying Bayes' theorem and potentially considering other factors (e.g., time of night, any potential witness statements).
