Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This tells us the general height distribution, which is less relevant given the specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution within the pool of potential attackers.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution. Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller, our best estimate of the attacker being that height is also 20%.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
