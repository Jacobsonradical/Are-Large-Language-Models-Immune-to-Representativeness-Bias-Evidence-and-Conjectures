Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This provides general information, but it's less relevant since we know the attack happened in a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information.  The attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate of the probability is based on that neighborhood data.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
