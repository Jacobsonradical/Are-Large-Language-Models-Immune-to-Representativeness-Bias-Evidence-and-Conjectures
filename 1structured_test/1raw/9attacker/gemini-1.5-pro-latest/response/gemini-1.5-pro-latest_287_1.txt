Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights, but might not be directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** Give a more relevant distribution of heights for potential suspects.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more reliable to use the neighborhood's height distribution.  We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
