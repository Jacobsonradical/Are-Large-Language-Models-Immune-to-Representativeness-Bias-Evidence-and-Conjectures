Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This is general information and less relevant to the specific attack.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is crucial because it reflects the population mix where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should base our probability on that information.  

* **The neighborhood has a 20% chance that a randomly selected person would be 185cm or taller.** 

Therefore, our best estimate of the attacker being 185cm or taller is based on the neighborhood demographics.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
