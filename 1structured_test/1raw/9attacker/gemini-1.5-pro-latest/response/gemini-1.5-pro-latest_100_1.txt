Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Statistics:** This provides general information, but the neighborhood data is more relevant in this case.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is crucial. The attack happened here, so this data is a better reflection of potential attackers.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize that information. The neighborhood has a 20% chance that a randomly selected person would be 185 cm or taller. This is our best estimate.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
