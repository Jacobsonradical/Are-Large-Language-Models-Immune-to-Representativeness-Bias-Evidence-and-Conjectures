Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** Offer more specific information about the area of the crime. This is more relevant than the city-wide data.

**Using the Relevant Information**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should focus on the height distribution within that neighborhood. We are told:

* 80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185cm.
* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller.

**The Probability**

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is directly based on the neighborhood's height distribution.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
