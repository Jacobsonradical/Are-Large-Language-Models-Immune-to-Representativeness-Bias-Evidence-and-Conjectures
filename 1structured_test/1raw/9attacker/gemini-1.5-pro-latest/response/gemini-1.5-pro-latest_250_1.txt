Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:**  Provide a general distribution of height, but aren't directly useful since the attack was localized.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** These are crucial. They tell us the height distribution within the pool of potential suspects.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should primarily base our estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution.  

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability is directly derived from that statistic.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
