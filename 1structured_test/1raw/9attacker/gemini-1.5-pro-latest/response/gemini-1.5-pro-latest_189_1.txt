Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Citywide Statistics:**  Provide a general distribution of heights. This is less relevant to our specific case.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** These are crucial because they reflect the population more likely to be present during the attack.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution.  There's a 20% chance that someone within that neighborhood is 185cm or taller. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
