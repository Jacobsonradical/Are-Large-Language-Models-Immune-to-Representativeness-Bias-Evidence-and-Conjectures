Here's how we can approach this problem:

* **We have a prior belief:**  Initially, we know that 15% of the city's population is 185cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
* **New evidence:** The attack happened in a neighborhood where the proportion of people 185cm or taller is higher (20%) than the city average.
* **Updating our belief:** The new evidence suggests the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is slightly more likely than our initial belief.  

While we don't have enough information to calculate the exact probability, we can make an educated estimate. The probability should be higher than 15% (the city average) but likely not as high as 20% (the neighborhood proportion). 

Here's a reasonable estimate:

**{probability: 0.17}** 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate.  A more precise calculation would require additional information and potentially the use of Bayes' Theorem.
