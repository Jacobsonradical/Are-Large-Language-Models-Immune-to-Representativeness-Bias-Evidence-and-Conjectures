Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide height distribution:**  This information is less relevant since we know the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution.
* **Neighborhood height distribution:** This is the crucial information.  There's a 20% chance that a randomly selected person from this neighborhood would be 185 cm or taller.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based solely on the neighborhood's height distribution. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.2}
