Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** Provide a general baseline. In the entire city, there's a 15% chance of a randomly chosen person being 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is crucial. The attack happened in a neighborhood where the proportion of taller people (20%) is higher than the city average.

**Logic**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood statistics over the city-wide statistics. It's more likely the attacker is someone from the neighborhood than a random person from the city.

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was this height is 20%.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
``` 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic estimate, not a definitive answer. We don't have enough information to say for certain the attacker's height.
