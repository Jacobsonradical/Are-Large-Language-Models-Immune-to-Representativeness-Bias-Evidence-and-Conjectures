Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights but aren't directly helpful for this specific case.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:**  Crucial because they represent the pool of potential attackers in the vicinity of the crime.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should rely on that information.  

* We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
