Here's how to approach this problem:

The most relevant information is the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. We know:

* **80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.**
* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, we should base our probability estimate on the neighborhood's demographics, not the city's overall demographics. 

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20
}
```
