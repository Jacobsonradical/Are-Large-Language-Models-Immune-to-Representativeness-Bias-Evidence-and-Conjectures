Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:** The city's population gives us a baseline. There's a 15% chance a random person is 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:** The neighborhood demographics differ from the city average. This new information should update our belief.

Since the neighborhood has a higher concentration of people 185cm or taller (20%) compared to the city average (15%), it's more likely the attacker belongs to this taller group.  

**It's important to note:** We can't definitively say the attacker *is* taller. There's still a possibility the attacker was shorter than 185cm.

**Estimate:**  While we don't have enough information for a precise calculation, a reasonable estimate would be to lean towards the higher probability suggested by the neighborhood demographics.

**{probability: 0.20}** 

This estimate uses the neighborhood information (20%) as the most relevant for our question.
