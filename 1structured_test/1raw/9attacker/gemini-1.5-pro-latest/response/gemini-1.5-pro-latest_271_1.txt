Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Citywide Statistics:**  Provide a general distribution of height, which might not be entirely accurate for the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** Offer a more relevant distribution of height for potential suspects.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, the neighborhood statistics are more relevant to determining the probability of the attacker's height.  The citywide statistics can be considered less important in this specific case.

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller, there's a higher chance the attacker falls into this category compared to the citywide average. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
