Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** Offer more specific information about the area where the attack took place.  Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, the neighborhood statistics are more relevant to estimating the attacker's height.

**Estimating the Probability**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller,  a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was this height is 20%.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
