Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide probability:** There's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person in the city is 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood-specific probability:** In the neighborhood of the attack, this probability increases to 20%.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information relevant to that location. The neighborhood has a higher concentration of taller people compared to the city average.

**Estimate**

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood's statistic.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
