Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:** This information acts as our baseline. It tells us the general distribution of heights in the city.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is more specific and relevant to the crime. It tells us the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about that neighborhood over the general city data.  The fact that the neighborhood has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) than the city average (15%) increases the likelihood that the attacker was taller.

**Estimate**

While we can't be certain, a reasonable estimate of the probability should be higher than the city average (15%) but lower than the neighborhood percentage (20%).  A probability closer to the neighborhood percentage makes more sense given the localized nature of the crime.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.18} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate.  Without more information about the attacker, we cannot definitively determine the probability of their height.
