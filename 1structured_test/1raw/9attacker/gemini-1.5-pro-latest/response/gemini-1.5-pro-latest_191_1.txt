Here's how we can approach this problem:

* **Base Rate:** The city's population height distribution gives us a base rate. There's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person from the city would be 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood Information:** The neighborhood's height distribution suggests a higher likelihood (20%) of finding someone 185cm or taller compared to the city average. 

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the information specific to that location.

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate is:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate.  We're assuming the attacker is someone from the neighborhood, which might not be true. Other factors could influence the attacker's height, and we don't have information about the victim's height for comparison.
