Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller. This is our baseline probability.
* **Neighborhood Specifics:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood with a higher proportion of people 185cm or taller, it's more likely the attacker belongs to that group compared to a random person in the city.

**Estimate**

While we can't be exact, a reasonable estimate should be higher than the city average of 15% but lower than the neighborhood's 20%.  A probability closer to the neighborhood percentage makes sense given the location of the attack.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.18 
}
``` 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate. We're making an educated guess based on limited information. Other factors could influence the attacker's height, and we don't have enough data to be definitive.
