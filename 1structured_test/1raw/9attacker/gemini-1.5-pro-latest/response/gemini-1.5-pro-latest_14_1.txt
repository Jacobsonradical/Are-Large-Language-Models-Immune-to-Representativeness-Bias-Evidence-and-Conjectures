Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  85% shorter than 185cm, 15% 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** 80% shorter than 185cm, 20% 185cm or taller.

**Key Point:** The attack happened in the neighborhood, so the neighborhood's height distribution is more relevant than the city's.

**Estimate:**

Since 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller, there's a higher likelihood the attacker belongs to this group compared to the city-wide average. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
