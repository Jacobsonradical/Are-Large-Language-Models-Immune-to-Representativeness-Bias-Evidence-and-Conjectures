Here's how to approach this problem:

Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about that neighborhood over the city's overall statistics.  

The relevant information is:

* **In the neighborhood:** 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

While the city's overall height distribution provides context, it's less directly relevant to the specific neighborhood where the attack took place.

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability is based on the neighborhood's data.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
