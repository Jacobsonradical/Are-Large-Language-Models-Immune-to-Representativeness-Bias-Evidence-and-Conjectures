Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This information is less relevant since we know the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information.  There's a 20% chance a randomly selected person from the neighborhood is 185cm or taller.

**Making the Estimate**

Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate is to use the neighborhood's height distribution. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
