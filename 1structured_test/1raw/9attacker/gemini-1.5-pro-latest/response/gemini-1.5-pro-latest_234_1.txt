Here's how we can approach this problem:

* **Base Rate:** The city's population gives us a base rate.  There's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person from the city would be 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood Information:** The neighborhood has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average.  This means we should adjust our probability estimate upwards.

Since the neighborhood has a significantly higher proportion of people 185cm or taller, it's more likely the attacker belongs to that group *given* the attack happened in that neighborhood. 

**However, we cannot directly conclude the probability is 20%.** The base rate still plays a role. We need more sophisticated methods (like Bayesian updating) to calculate the exact adjusted probability.

**Estimate:** Given the information, a reasonable estimate would be higher than the city average but likely lower than the neighborhood percentage. 

**{probability: 0.175}** 

This is just an estimate. A more accurate calculation would require additional information and statistical analysis.
