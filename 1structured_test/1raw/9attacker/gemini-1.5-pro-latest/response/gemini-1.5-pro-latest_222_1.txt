Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This tells us the general height distribution, but it's less relevant given the specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial piece of information.  It tells us that there's a higher chance (20%) of encountering someone 185cm or taller in the neighborhood where the attack happened compared to the city average.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution. Therefore, our estimate should be closer to the neighborhood's probability of someone being 185cm or taller. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:**  This is a probability estimate based on available information. We cannot definitively say the attacker was 185cm or taller. Other factors could influence the actual height of the attacker.
