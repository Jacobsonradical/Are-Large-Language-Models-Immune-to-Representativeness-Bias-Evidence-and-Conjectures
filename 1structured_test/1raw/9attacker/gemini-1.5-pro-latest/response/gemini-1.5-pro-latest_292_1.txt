Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This tells us the general height distribution, but it's less relevant since we have specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information. It tells us that in the area of the attack, there's a higher chance (20%) of someone being 185 cm or taller compared to the city average.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should primarily base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution. Therefore, our estimate should be close to the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate.  Without more information about the attacker, we cannot be more precise. Other factors could influence the probability, such as the possibility that the attacker wasn't even from the neighborhood.
