Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This provides general information, but it's less relevant than the specific neighborhood data.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:**  This is the crucial information. It tells us the height distribution within the area where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with the known statistic of 20% of people being 185 cm or taller, our best estimate of the attacker being that height is based on that information. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
