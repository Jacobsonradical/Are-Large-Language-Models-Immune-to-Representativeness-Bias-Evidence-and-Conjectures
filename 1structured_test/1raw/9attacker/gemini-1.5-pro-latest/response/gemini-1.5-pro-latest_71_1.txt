Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Probability:**  There's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person in the city is 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood Probability:** In the neighborhood of the attack, there's a 20% chance a randomly chosen person is 185cm or taller.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about that neighborhood.  The city-wide probability is less relevant in this case.

**Estimate**

It's important to note that we're making an estimate, not calculating a precise probability. Given the information, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than the neighborhood average:

**{probability: 0.25}** 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate.  Without more information about the attacker or other circumstances, we cannot be certain of their height.
