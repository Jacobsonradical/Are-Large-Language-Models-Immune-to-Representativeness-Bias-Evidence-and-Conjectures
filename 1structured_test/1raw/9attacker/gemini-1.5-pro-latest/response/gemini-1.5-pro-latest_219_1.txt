Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This provides general information but isn't directly useful for a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information, telling us the height distribution in the area of the attack.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should rely on that information.  We're told 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
