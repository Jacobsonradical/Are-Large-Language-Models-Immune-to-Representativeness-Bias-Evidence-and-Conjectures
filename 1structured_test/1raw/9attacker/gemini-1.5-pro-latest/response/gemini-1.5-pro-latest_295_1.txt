Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This tells us the general height distribution, which is less relevant in this specific case.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information.  The attack happened in a neighborhood where taller people are more common than the city average. 

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution.  Therefore, there's a higher chance the attacker belongs to the 20% of the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
