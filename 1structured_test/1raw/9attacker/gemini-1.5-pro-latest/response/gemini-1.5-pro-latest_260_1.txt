Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide height distribution:**  This provides general information but isn't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood height distribution:** This is the crucial piece of information.  The attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should rely on that information.  

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
