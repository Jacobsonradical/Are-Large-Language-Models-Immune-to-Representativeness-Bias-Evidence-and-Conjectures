Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Statistics:**  This information acts as our base rate.  It tells us the general distribution of heights in the city.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is more specific and relevant to our case. It tells us the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Logic**

Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood statistics over the city-wide statistics. The neighborhood information gives us a more accurate picture of potential attackers in that area.

**Calculation**

The neighborhood statistics tell us that 20% of people in that area are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
