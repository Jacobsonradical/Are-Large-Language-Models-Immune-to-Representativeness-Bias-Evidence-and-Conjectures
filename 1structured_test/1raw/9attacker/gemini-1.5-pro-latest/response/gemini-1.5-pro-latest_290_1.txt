Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Citywide Statistics:**  The city's height distribution acts as our base rate. It tells us that in a random sample from the city, there's a 15% chance of someone being 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more likely the attacker is someone from that neighborhood. Therefore, we should give more weight to the neighborhood statistics than the citywide statistics.

**Estimation**

While we don't have enough information to calculate the exact probability, we can make an educated estimate. The probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller should be higher than the city average (15%) but not necessarily as high as the neighborhood's percentage (20%). 

A reasonable estimate would fall somewhere between these two values.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.175} 

**Note:** This is just one possible estimate. You could choose a value closer to 15% or 20% depending on how much weight you give to the neighborhood demographics.
