Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  This gives us general information, but it's less relevant than the specific neighborhood data.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information.  It tells us the height distribution of people in the area where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should base our probability on that information.

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller.**

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability is based on the neighborhood data:

**{probability: 0.20}**
