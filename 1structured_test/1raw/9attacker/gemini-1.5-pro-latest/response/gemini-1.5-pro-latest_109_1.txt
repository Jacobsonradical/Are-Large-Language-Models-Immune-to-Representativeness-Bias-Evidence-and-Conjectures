Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:**  Provide a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** Give a more specific distribution relevant to the crime.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city-wide distribution. It's more likely the attacker is someone from the neighborhood.

**Calculation**

The neighborhood information tells us that 20% of people in that area are 185 cm or taller.  

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
