Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** Offer more relevant information about potential attackers in the specific area.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, the neighborhood statistics are more relevant in estimating the attacker's height. The city-wide statistics are less useful in this specific case.

**Calculation**

The neighborhood statistics tell us that 20% of people in that area are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
