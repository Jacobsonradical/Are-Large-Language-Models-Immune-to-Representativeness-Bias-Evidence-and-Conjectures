Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:** The city's population gives us a starting point.  There's a 15% chance a random person is 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:** The neighborhood demographics suggest a higher likelihood of taller people (20%) compared to the city average.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to use the neighborhood statistics.  

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood's statistic.**

**{probability: 0.20}**
