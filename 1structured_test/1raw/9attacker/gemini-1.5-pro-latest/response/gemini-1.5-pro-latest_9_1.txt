Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller. This is our base rate.
* **Neighborhood Specifics:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller people (20%) compared to the city average.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about that neighborhood.  The city-wide average is less relevant in this specific case.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood's statistic.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
