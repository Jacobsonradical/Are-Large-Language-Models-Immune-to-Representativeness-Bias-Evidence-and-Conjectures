Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:**  The city's population suggests a 15% chance of someone being 185 cm or taller.
* **We have new information:** The neighborhood demographics show a higher concentration (20%) of taller people.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to use the neighborhood's demographic information.  

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
