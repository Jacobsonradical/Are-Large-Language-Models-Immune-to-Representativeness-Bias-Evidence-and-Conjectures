Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:** This acts as our base rate. It tells us the general distribution of heights in the city.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is more specific to our situation. The attack happened in this neighborhood, making this information more relevant.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about that neighborhood over the general city data. The higher concentration of people taller than 185cm in the neighborhood suggests a higher likelihood that the attacker also shares this characteristic.

**Estimate**

While we cannot definitively say the attacker's height, a reasonable estimate based on the given information is closer to the neighborhood's statistic.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.8 
}
``` 

**Important Note:**  This is an estimate.  Without more information, we can't be certain of the attacker's height. Other factors could also be relevant (e.g., was the victim targeted for a specific reason, were there any witnesses, etc.).
