Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Probability:**  There's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person in the city is 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood Probability:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher concentration of taller people (20% are 185cm or taller).

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, the information about the neighborhood is more relevant than the city-wide data. We should base our estimate on the neighborhood demographics.

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller, there's a higher chance the attacker falls into this category compared to the city average. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
