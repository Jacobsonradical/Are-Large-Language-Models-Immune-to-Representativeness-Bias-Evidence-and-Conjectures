Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This provides general information but isn't directly useful for a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information as it reflects the height distribution where the attack occurred.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should rely on that information.  We are told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer:**

```json
{probability: 0.20} 
``` 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on the available data.  We cannot definitively say the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Other factors could be relevant, such as the victim's perception of height even in a limited view.
