Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This provides general information, but isn't directly useful for a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution where the attack occurred.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should rely on that information.  We're told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
