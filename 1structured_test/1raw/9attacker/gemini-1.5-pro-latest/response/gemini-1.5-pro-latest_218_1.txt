Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We're given base rates:** The city's height distribution (85% shorter, 15% taller) and the neighborhood's height distribution (80% shorter, 20% taller).
* **We need to update our belief:** The attack happened in the neighborhood, so the neighborhood's height distribution is more relevant than the city's.

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185cm or taller.**

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
