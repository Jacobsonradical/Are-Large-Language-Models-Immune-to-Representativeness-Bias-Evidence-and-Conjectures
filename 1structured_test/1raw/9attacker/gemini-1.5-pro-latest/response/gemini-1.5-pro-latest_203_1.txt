Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant given the specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution within the pool of potential attackers.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should rely on that information:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on the neighborhood demographics.**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
