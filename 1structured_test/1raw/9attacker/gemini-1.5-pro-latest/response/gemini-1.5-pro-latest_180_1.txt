Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Statistics:**  Provide a general picture but aren't directly relevant to the neighborhood where the attack happened.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution of potential attackers in the relevant area.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should base our estimate on that information:

* **Probability of attacker being 185cm or taller (in the neighborhood): 20%**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
