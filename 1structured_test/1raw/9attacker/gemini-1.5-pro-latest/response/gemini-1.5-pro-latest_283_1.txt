Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This information gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant than the neighborhood data.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information because the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood.

**The Key Insight**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our probability estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution. 

**Calculation**

We are given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
