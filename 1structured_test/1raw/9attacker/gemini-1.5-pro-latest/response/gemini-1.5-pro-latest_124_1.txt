Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This information is less relevant because we know the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution. 
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information. It tells us that there's a higher chance (20%) of encountering someone 185cm or taller in this neighborhood compared to the city average.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution.  

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is a simple estimate. Other factors could influence the probability, such as:

* **Time of day:** Was the attack at a time when taller people might be more likely to be out?
* **Location specifics:**  Were there any factors about the location within the neighborhood that might attract people of a certain height? 

Without more information, using the neighborhood height distribution is the most logical approach.
