Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of height but aren't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution within the relevant population. 

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution. We are given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
