Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:**  Provides a general distribution of heights, but it's less relevant given the specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is the crucial information because the attack happened in this specific location.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of people are 185 cm or taller, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was at least that tall is simply that percentage.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
