Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This tells us the general height distribution, but it's less relevant to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should rely on that information.  We know that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20% or 0.2.**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.2}
