Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This gives us general information, but it's less relevant than the specific neighborhood data.
* **Neighborhood distribution:**  This is crucial. The attack happened here, so we should prioritize this information.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should base our probability on that.  In this neighborhood:

* 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on the available data.  We cannot definitively say the attacker was 185 cm or taller with 100% certainty. Other factors could influence the actual probability, but this is the best estimate we can make given the information.
