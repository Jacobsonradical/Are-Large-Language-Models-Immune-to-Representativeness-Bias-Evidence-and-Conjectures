Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This information is less relevant because we know the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information.  It tells us that there's a higher chance (20%) of encountering someone 185cm or taller in that neighborhood compared to the city average.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution.  Therefore:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

**Important Note:**  This is just an estimate based on the available information.  Other factors could influence the attacker's height, and we don't have enough data to make a definitive conclusion.
