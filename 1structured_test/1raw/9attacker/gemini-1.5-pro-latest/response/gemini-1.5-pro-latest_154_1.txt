Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This gives us general information, but isn't directly useful for a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information, as the attacker likely came from the neighborhood.

**Calculating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should focus on the neighborhood statistics:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

This means there's a 20% chance the attacker belongs to the group that's 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
