Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general baseline but aren't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood statistics:**  More relevant to the situation, as the attack occurred in this specific area.

**Focusing on Relevant Data**

Since we're interested in the probability of the attacker being from the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we should focus on the neighborhood's height distribution.

**The Answer**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was this height is:

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
