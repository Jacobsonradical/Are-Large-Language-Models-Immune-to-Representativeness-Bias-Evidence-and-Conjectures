Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  This gives us a general idea of height distribution, but it's less relevant given the more specific neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information.  The attack happened here, so we prioritize the local height distribution.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should base our estimate on that.  We are told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
