Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Provides general information but might not be directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is more relevant as it reflects the height distribution within the area of the crime.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city-wide data.  It's more likely the attacker is someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, there's a higher chance the attacker belongs to this group compared to the city average.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
