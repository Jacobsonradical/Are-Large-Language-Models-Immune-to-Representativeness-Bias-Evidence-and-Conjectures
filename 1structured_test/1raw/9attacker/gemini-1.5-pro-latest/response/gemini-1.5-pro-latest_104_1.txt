Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior belief:** Based on the city's demographics, there's a 15% chance a random person is 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher concentration of taller people (20%). 

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood with a higher proportion of people 185cm or taller, we should adjust our probability estimate to reflect this new information. It's more likely the attacker is from this neighborhood than a random sample of the city.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is higher than the city average but not necessarily as high as the neighborhood's percentage.  A reasonable estimate would be somewhere between the city average and the neighborhood percentage.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.175} 

**Explanation:**

This estimate is a simple average between the city's 15% and the neighborhood's 20%. While a more precise calculation could be done with Bayesian updating, this provides a reasonable approximation given the information.
