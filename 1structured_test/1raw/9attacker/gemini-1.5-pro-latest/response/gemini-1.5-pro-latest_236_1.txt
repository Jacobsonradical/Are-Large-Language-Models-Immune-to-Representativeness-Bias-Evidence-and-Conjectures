Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Provides general information but isn't directly useful for a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is crucial. It tells us the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should rely on that information.  We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
