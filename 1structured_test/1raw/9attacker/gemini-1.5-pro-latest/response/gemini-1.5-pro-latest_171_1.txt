Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Provides general information about height distribution but isn't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is the crucial information because it reflects the height distribution within the area where the attack took place.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should focus solely on that information. We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on the available data.  We cannot definitively say the attacker was 185cm or taller with 100% certainty. Other factors could influence the actual probability, such as the time of day and the demographics of who was in the area.
