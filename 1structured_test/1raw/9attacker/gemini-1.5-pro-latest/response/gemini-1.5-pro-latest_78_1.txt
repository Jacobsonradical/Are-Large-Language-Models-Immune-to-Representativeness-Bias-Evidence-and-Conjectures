Here's how we can approach this problem:

The information about the city's height distribution is less relevant than the information about the neighborhood.  Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize that information.

**Therefore, we can estimate the probability based on the neighborhood demographics:**

* **Probability the attacker is 185cm or taller:** 20% 

**Answer:** {probability: 0.20}
