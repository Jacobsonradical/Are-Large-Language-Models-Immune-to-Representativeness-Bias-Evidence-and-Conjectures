Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior belief:**  Initially, we know that 15% of the city's population is 185cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
* **New evidence:** The attack occurred in a neighborhood where the proportion of people 185cm or taller is higher (20%). 
* **Update our belief:**  We need to update our prior belief based on this new evidence.  While we don't have enough information for a precise calculation, it's more likely the attacker is 185cm or taller given the neighborhood demographics.

Since the neighborhood has a higher concentration of taller people, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller should be higher than the city average but lower than the neighborhood percentage.

**Estimate:**

{probability: 0.175} 

**Explanation:** This estimate represents a middle ground between the citywide probability (0.15) and the neighborhood probability (0.20).
