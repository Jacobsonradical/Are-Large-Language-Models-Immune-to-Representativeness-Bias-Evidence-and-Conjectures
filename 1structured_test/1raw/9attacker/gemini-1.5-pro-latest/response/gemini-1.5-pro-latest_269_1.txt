Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Focus on the relevant information:** The key piece of information is the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. The city's overall height distribution is less relevant. 
* **Use the neighborhood data:**  You are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, your estimate should be based on the neighborhood data.

**Answer:** {probability: 0.20}
