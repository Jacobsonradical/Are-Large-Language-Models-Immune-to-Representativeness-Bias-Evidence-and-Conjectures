Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Statistics:**  This information acts as a general background but might not be directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information as it reflects the height distribution within the area where the attack happened.

**Focusing on Relevant Data**

Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution:

* 80% are shorter than 185 cm
* 20% are 185 cm or taller

**Estimating the Probability**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker belonged to this group is simply 20%.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
