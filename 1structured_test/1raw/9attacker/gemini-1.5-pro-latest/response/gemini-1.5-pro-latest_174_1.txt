Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Tell us the general height distribution in the city, which acts as our base rate.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** Provide more specific information about the area where the attack occurred. This is more relevant to the potential attacker pool.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city's general distribution. This is because the attacker likely came from the neighborhood.

**Estimate**

The neighborhood statistics tell us that 20% of people in that area are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, there's a higher chance the attacker belongs to this group compared to the city average.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
