Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:** This acts as our base rate or prior probability. It tells us that in general, there's a 15% chance of someone in the city being 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is more specific information related to the crime. It suggests that the neighborhood has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should give more weight to the neighborhood data.  The higher concentration of taller people in the neighborhood makes it more likely the attacker was also taller.

**Estimate**

While we don't have enough information to calculate the exact probability, we can make an educated estimate.  The probability should be higher than the city average (15%) but not necessarily as high as the neighborhood percentage (20%).  

**Answer**

{probability: 0.18} 

**Explanation:** This estimate leans closer to the neighborhood data, acknowledging the higher likelihood of the attacker being taller given the local demographics.
