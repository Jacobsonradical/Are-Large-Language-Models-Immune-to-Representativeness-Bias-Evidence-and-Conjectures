Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  This gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant than the specific neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial information. The attacker was in this neighborhood, so these percentages are more important.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known 20% chance of someone being 185 cm or taller, our best estimate of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is simply that percentage.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
