Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide height distribution:** This information acts as our base rate. It tells us the general likelihood of someone in the city being a certain height.
* **Neighborhood height distribution:** This information is more specific and relevant to our case. It tells us the height distribution within the area where the attack happened. 

**Focusing on Relevant Information**

Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about that neighborhood's height distribution. The city-wide distribution is less helpful in this particular case.

**Estimating the Probability**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is simply that percentage.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
