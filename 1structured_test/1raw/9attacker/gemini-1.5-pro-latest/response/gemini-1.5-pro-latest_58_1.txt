Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller. This is our baseline.
* **Neighborhood:** The attack happened in a neighborhood where taller people are more common (20% are 185cm or taller).

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood with a higher concentration of taller people, it's more likely (compared to a random person in the city) that the attacker was also taller.  While we don't have enough information to be exact, we should adjust our probability estimate upwards from the city average of 15%.

**A Reasonable Estimate**

A probability between 15% and 20% would be a reasonable estimate. We can't be certain, but the neighborhood information suggests a higher likelihood.

**Answer Format**

Here's a possible answer, remembering that there's a range of acceptable estimates:

```json
{
"probability": 0.18 
}
```
