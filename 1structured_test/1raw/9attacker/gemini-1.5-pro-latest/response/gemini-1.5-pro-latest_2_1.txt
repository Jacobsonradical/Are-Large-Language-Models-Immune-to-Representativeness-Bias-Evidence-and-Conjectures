Here's how to approach this problem:

We need to use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it's more specific than the city-wide data. 

* **City-wide data:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood data:** 20% of people are 185cm or taller.

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood data. 

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability is:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
``` 

This means there's a 20% chance the attacker was 185cm or taller, based on the information provided.
