Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This gives us general information, but it's less relevant than the specific neighborhood data.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information because the attack happened in this specific neighborhood.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should base our probability on that. In this neighborhood:

* 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on the neighborhood demographics.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
