Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:**  This acts as our base rate. It tells us the general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is more specific to the situation. The attacker was in this neighborhood, so this information is more relevant.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city-wide distribution. 

**Estimate**

The neighborhood data tells us that 20% of people in that area are 185cm or taller.  Therefore, there's a higher chance the attacker belongs to this group compared to the city average.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
