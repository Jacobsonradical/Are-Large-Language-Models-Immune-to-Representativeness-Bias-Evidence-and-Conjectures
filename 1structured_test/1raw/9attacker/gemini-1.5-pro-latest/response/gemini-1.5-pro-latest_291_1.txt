Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide height distribution:**  This information is less relevant since we know the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution.
* **Neighborhood height distribution:** This is the crucial information. It tells us that there's a 20% chance a randomly selected person from the neighborhood is 185cm or taller.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is based solely on the neighborhood's height distribution. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
