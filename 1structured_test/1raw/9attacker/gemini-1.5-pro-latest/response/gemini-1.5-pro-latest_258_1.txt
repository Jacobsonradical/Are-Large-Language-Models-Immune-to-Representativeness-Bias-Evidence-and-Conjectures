Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:**  Provides a general distribution of heights, but isn't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution within the relevant population.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should rely on that information:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Therefore, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%.**

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
