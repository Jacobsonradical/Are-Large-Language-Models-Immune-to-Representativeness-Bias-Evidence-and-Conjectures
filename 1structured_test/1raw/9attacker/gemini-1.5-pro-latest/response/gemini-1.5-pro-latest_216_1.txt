Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller. This is our base rate.
* **Neighborhood Specifics:** The neighborhood where the attack happened has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood with a higher proportion of taller people, it's more likely the attacker was also taller.  We should adjust our probability estimate upwards from the city average to reflect this.

**Estimate**

While we don't have enough information to calculate an exact probability, a reasonable estimate should fall between the city average (15% or 0.15) and the neighborhood proportion (20% or 0.20).

A simple way to estimate is to take the average of the two proportions:

(0.15 + 0.20) / 2 = 0.175

**Answer**

{probability: 0.175}
