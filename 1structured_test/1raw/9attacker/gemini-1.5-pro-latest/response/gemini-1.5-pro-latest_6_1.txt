Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This tells us the general height distribution, but it's less relevant to the specific neighborhood of the attack.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information. It tells us the height distribution within the pool of potential suspects.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution.  We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
