Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:**  The city's population gives us a starting point. There's a 15% chance a random person is 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:** The neighborhood demographics show a higher concentration (20%) of people 185cm or taller.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to consider the neighborhood demographics than the city-wide statistics. 

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability is closer to the neighborhood's percentage.**

**{probability: 0.20}**
