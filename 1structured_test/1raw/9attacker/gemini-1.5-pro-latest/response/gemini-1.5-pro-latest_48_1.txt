Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:** The city's population gives us a baseline. There's a 15% chance a random person is 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:** The neighborhood's demographics show a higher concentration of people 185cm or taller (20%).  

Since the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, we should weigh the neighborhood information more heavily than the general city information. 

Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood percentage rather than the city percentage.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
