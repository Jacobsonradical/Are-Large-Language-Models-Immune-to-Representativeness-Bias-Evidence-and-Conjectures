Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:** The city's population gives us a starting point. There's a 15% chance a random person is 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:**  The neighborhood demographics differ from the city average, with a higher percentage (20%) of taller people.

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to use the neighborhood demographics than the city-wide data. 

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Explanation:**  We estimate the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller to be 20%, based on the height distribution within the neighborhood where the attack took place.
