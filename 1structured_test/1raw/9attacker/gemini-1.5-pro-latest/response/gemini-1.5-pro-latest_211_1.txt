Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  The city's height distribution provides a general baseline, but it's less relevant given the specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is crucial. The fact that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller is the most direct evidence we have for estimating the attacker's height.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more likely that the attacker is someone from that neighborhood. Therefore, we should base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution.

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller, there's a 20% chance the attacker falls into that category.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
