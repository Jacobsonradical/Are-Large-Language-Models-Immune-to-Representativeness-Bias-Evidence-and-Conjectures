Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide height distribution:**  This information acts as a baseline, but it's less relevant given the specific details about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood height distribution:** This is the crucial information. We know that 20% of people in the neighborhood where the attack happened are 185cm or taller.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since we have specific information about the neighborhood, it's reasonable to base our probability estimate on that data.  

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is based on the neighborhood's height distribution.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
