Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Statistics:**  Provide a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:**  More specific to the situation, suggesting the pool of potential attackers might have a different height distribution than the city overall.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to consider the neighborhood's height distribution rather than the city's. We should base our probability estimate on the fact that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is a probability estimate based on limited information.  Other factors could influence the actual height of the attacker, and we cannot definitively determine the attacker's height from this data alone.
