Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** This provides general information but isn't directly useful for our estimate.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is crucial because it reflects the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Making the Estimate**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution. We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
