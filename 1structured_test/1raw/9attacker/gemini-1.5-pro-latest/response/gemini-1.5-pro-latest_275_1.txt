Here's how we can approach this problem:

* **Focus on the relevant population:**  The city's overall height distribution is less important than the distribution within the neighborhood of the attack. 
* **Use the neighborhood data:** We know that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. This is our best starting point.

While we don't have definitive proof, the attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood than a random person from the city. 

Therefore, a reasonable estimate is:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

**Important Note:**  This is just an estimate based on limited information. Other factors could influence the attacker's height, and we cannot definitively determine the probability without more evidence.
