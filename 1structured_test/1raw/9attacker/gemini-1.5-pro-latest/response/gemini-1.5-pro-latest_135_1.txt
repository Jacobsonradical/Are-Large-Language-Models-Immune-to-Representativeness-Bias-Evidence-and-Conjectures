Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Provides general information but isn't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:**  This is crucial because the attack happened in a specific location with different demographics.

**Focusing on Relevant Information**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should focus on the neighborhood's height distribution:

* 80% are shorter than 185 cm.
* 20% are 185 cm or taller.

**Estimating the Probability**

Given the neighborhood demographics, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is directly represented by the percentage of people in that neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
