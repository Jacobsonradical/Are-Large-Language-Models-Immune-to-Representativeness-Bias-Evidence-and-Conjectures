Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:** This acts as our base rate. It tells us the general distribution of heights in the city.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is more specific and likely more relevant to the crime. The attacker was likely from the neighborhood, making this information more valuable.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about that neighborhood. It suggests a higher likelihood (20%) of someone being 185cm or taller compared to the city average (15%).

**Estimate**

While we don't have enough information for a precise calculation, a reasonable estimate should be higher than the city average but not drastically so. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate.  Other factors could influence the actual probability, such as the victim's potential biases in remembering details or additional information about potential suspects.
