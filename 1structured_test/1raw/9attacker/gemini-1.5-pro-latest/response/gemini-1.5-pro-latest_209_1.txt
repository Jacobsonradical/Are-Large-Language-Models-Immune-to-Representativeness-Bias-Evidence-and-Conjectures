Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This provides general information but isn't directly useful since we have more specific data about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information, telling us the height distribution within the area of the attack.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should base our probability estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution.  

* **20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on that neighborhood statistic.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
