Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  The city's height distribution provides a general baseline, but it's less important than the neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average (15%). This local information is more relevant to the attacker's potential height.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood statistics.  Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate. We cannot definitively determine the attacker's height without more information.
