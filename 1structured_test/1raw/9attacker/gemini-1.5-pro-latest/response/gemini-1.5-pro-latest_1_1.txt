Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Focus on the relevant information:** The key piece of information is the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. The city's overall height distribution is less relevant.
* **Use the neighborhood data:**  We know that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the available information, our best estimate of the probability is:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

**Important Note:** This is a simple estimate based solely on height distribution.  Real-world criminal investigations would consider many other factors.
