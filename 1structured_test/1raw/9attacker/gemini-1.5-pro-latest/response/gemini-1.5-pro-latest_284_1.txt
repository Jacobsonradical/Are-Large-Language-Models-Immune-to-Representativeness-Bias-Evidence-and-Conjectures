Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Base Rate:** The city's population provides a base rate of height distribution. However, this is less relevant than the specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Information:** The neighborhood demographics are more important. They tell us there's a higher chance of encountering someone taller than 185cm in the area where the attack took place.

Since we want to estimate the probability based on the available information, we should focus on the neighborhood demographics:

**{probability: 0.20}**

**Explanation:**  There's a 20% chance a randomly selected person from the neighborhood where the attack occurred would be 185cm or taller. This is the best estimate we can make with the given information.
