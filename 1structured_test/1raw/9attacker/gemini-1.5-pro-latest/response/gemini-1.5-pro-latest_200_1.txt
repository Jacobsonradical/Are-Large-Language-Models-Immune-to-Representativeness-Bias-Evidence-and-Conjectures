Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We need to focus on the relevant information:** The attack happened in a specific neighborhood, so the city-wide height distribution is less important.
* **Use the neighborhood data:** In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185cm or taller. 

Since we have no other information about the attacker, our best estimate of the probability is based on the neighborhood demographics.

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.20}
