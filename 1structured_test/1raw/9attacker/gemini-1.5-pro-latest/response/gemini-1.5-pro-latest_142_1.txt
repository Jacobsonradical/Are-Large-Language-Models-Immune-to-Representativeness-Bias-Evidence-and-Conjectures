Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This gives us a general idea of height distribution, but it's less relevant given the specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information. It tells us the height distribution within the area where the attack occurred.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should rely on that information.  We're told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
