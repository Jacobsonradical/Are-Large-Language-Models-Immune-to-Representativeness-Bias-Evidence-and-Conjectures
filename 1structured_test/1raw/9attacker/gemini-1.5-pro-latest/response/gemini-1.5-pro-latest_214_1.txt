Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This provides general information but isn't directly useful for our estimate.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is crucial information. It tells us the height distribution in the relevant population.

**Making the Estimate**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution. 

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on that neighborhood statistic.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
