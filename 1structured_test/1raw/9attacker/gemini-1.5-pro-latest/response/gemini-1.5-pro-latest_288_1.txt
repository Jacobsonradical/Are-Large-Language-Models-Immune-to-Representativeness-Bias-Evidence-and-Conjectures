Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Provides general information, which might not be very helpful in this specific case.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is crucial because the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution than the city as a whole.

**Focusing on Relevant Information**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution:

* 80% are shorter than 185cm
* 20% are 185cm or taller

**Estimating the Probability**

Based on the neighborhood data, there is a 20% chance that a randomly selected person from that neighborhood would be 185cm or taller.  While we don't know for sure about the attacker, this is the best estimate we can make with the available information.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
