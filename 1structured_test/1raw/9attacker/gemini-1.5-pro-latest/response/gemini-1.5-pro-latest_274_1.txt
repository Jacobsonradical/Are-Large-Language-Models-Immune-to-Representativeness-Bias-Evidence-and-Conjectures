Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Provides general information but isn't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is crucial because it reflects the height distribution within the area where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should rely on the neighborhood's height distribution. We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
