Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:**  Provides general information but isn't directly useful for a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:**  This is crucial. It tells us the height distribution within the relevant population.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, we should base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution. 

* We know that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Therefore, our estimate is:**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on the available information.  There could be other factors we don't know about that could influence the actual probability.
