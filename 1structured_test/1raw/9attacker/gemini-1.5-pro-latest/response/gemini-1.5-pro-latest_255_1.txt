Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Focus on the relevant information:** The most crucial piece of information is the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. The city's overall height distribution is less relevant.
* **Use the neighborhood data:** In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the available information, our best estimate of the probability is:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

This means there's a 20% chance the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the height distribution in the neighborhood.
