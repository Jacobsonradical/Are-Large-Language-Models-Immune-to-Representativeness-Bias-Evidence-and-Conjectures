Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  This gives us a general idea of height distribution but isn't directly useful for a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is crucial. It tells us the height distribution within the area where the attack happened.

**Focusing on Relevant Data**

Since we're interested in the probability of the attacker being from the neighborhood, we'll use the neighborhood statistics:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller.

**Estimating the Probability**

Without any other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the probability that they were 185cm or taller is simply the percentage of people in that neighborhood who fit that description.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
