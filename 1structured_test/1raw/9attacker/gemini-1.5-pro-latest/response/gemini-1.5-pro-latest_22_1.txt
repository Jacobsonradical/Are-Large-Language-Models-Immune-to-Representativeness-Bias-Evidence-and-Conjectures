Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior belief:**  Initially, we think there's a 15% chance someone in the city is 185cm or taller.
* **New evidence:** The attack happened in a neighborhood where taller people are more common (20% are 185cm or taller).

Since the neighborhood has a higher concentration of taller people, it makes it slightly more likely the attacker was also taller.  However, we can't be certain. 

**Estimate:** It's difficult to give a precise probability without more information.  However, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than the city average of 15%, but lower than the neighborhood's 20%.

**{probability: 0.17}** 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimate. A more accurate calculation would require using Bayesian reasoning and potentially considering other factors.
