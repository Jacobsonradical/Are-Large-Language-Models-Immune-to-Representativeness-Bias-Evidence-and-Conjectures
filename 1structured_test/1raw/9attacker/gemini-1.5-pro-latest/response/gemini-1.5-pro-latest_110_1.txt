Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Focus on the relevant information:** The key piece of information is the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.  The city-wide statistics are less relevant.
* **Interpret the neighborhood data:**  We know that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

Since we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the probability is based on the neighborhood demographics:

**{probability: 0.20} **
