Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This gives us a general idea, but it's less important than the neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial piece of information. It tells us that in the area where the attack happened, someone is more likely to be 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the city average (15%).

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should base our estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution.  

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate. We don't have enough information to definitively say the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Other factors could be relevant, such as the victim's height or any additional witness statements.
