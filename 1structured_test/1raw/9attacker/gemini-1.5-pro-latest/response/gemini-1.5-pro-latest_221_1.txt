Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant than the neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is crucial because the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution than the city overall.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should rely on the neighborhood's height distribution:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

**Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are that height.**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
