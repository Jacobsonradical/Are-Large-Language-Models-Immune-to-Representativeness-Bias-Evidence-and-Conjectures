Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide average:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood demographic:**  20% of people are 185cm or taller. 

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's demographic information over the city-wide average. This is because the attacker is more likely to be from the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

**Estimate**

Given the neighborhood's demographics, there's a higher chance the attacker is 185cm or taller compared to the city average.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
