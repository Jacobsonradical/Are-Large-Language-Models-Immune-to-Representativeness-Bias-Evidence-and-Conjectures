Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:** This provides general information, but isn't directly useful for a specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is crucial because it reflects the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood data:

* 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

While the city-wide data isn't useless (it suggests taller people might be slightly more common), the neighborhood information is far more relevant.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
