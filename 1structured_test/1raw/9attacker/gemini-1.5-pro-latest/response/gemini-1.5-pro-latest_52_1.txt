Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This information gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant than the neighborhood data.
* **Neighborhood distribution:**  This is crucial because the attack happened in this specific neighborhood. It tells us there's a higher chance of encountering someone taller than 185cm in the neighborhood compared to the city average.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution.  Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **20%**.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
