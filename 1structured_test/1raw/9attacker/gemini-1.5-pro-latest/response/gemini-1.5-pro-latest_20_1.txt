Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This gives us general information, but it's less relevant than the neighborhood data.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information because the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should base our probability on that:

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

**Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2.**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.2}
