Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This provides general information but isn't directly useful for our estimate.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is crucial because it reflects the population from which the attacker likely originated.

**Making the Estimate**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution. We're given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
