Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This information is less relevant since we know the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information.  The attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller, the probability that the attacker falls into this group is higher than the city average.  

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimate.  Other factors could influence the actual probability, such as the time of day (were taller people more likely to be out at that time?), the victim's social circles, etc.
