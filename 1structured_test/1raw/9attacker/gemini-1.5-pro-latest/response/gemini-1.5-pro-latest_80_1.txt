Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This information acts as a baseline, telling us the general height distribution in the city. 
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is more important.  Since the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, the height distribution there is more relevant to determining the likelihood of the attacker's height.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should rely on that information.  

* We know that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185cm or taller. 

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is 20%.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
