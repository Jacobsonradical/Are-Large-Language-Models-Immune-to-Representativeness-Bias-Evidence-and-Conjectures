Here's how to approach this problem:

The information about the city's overall height distribution is less relevant than the specific information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred.  We should base our estimate on the neighborhood demographics.

Since the neighborhood has 20% of its population at a height of 185cm or taller, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was this height is also 20%.

**{probability: 0.20}**
