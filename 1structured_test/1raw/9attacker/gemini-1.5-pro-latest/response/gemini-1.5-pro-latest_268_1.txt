Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller. This is our base rate.
* **Neighborhood Specifics:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average. 

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood with a higher proportion of taller people, it's more likely the attacker was also taller.  We should adjust our probability estimate upwards from the city average of 15% towards the neighborhood rate of 20%.

It's impossible to know the exact probability without more information.  However, we can make an informed estimate.

**Estimate:**

{probability: 0.175} 

**Explanation:**

This estimate represents a middle ground between the city average (0.15) and the neighborhood rate (0.20).  We lean closer to the neighborhood rate because the attack occurred within that specific context. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an estimate. Other factors could be considered, such as the time of day, the attacker's potential motivation, and any other witness statements, even if they are vague.
