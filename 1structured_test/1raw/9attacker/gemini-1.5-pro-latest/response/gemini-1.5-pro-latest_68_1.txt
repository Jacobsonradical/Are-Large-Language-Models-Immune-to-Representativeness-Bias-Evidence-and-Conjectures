Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide average:**  85% shorter, 15% taller than 185cm. This gives us a baseline.
* **Neighborhood demographic:**  80% shorter, 20% taller than 185cm.  This suggests a higher concentration of taller individuals in the area of the attack.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where taller people are more common than the city average, it's more likely the attacker was taller than 185cm *compared to the city-wide probability*.

**Estimate**

We should estimate a probability higher than the city average of 15%, but we can't be certain it's as high as the neighborhood's 20%.  A reasonable estimate would fall somewhere in between.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.175} 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on limited information. Other factors could influence the attacker's height, and we don't have enough data to be precise.
