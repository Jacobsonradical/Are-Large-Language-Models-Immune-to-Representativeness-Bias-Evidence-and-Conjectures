Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This provides general information but isn't directly applicable to the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:**  This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution where the attack occurred.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should base our estimate on that information.  

* We know that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 20%.**

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
