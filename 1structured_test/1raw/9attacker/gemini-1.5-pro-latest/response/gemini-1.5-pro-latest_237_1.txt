Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This tells us the general height distribution, but it's less relevant given the specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information. It tells us that in the area where the attack happened, someone is more likely to be 185cm or taller (20%) than in the city as a whole (15%).

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should base our probability on the neighborhood's height distribution.  

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on the available information.  Without more evidence, we cannot definitively say the attacker's height.
