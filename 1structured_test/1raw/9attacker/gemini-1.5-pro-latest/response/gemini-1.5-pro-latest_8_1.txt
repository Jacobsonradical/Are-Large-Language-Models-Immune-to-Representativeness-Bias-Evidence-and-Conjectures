Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This information acts as a baseline. It tells us the general distribution of heights in the city.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is more specific and relevant to our case. It tells us the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood statistics over the general city statistics. The neighborhood has a higher concentration of people taller than 185cm (20%) compared to the city average (15%).

**Estimate**

Given the higher concentration of taller individuals in the neighborhood, it's more likely the attacker was also taller than 185cm. A reasonable estimate, considering we only have height distribution and no other information about the attacker, would be slightly higher than the neighborhood average.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.25} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate based on limited information. Other factors could influence the attacker's height, and without more evidence, we cannot be certain.
