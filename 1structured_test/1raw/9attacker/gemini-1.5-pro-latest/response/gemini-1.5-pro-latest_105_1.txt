Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline, but aren't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is crucial, as it reflects the height distribution within the area where the attack occurred. 

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should prioritize that information.  Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on the neighborhood's demographics.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Explanation:**  There's a 20% chance the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood's population distribution.
