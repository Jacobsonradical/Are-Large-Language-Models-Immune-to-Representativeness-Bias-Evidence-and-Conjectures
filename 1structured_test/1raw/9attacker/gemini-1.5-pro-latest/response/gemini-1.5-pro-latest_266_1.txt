Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  In the general population, there's a 15% chance a random person would be 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** In the specific neighborhood of the attack, there's a 20% chance a random person would be 185cm or taller.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, the neighborhood statistics are more relevant than the city-wide statistics.  It's more likely the attacker is someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimate**

While we don't have definitive proof, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is closer to the neighborhood statistic.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
``` 

**Important Note:**  This is just an estimate.  Without more information about the attacker, we cannot be certain of their height.
