Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  85% shorter than 185cm, 15% 185cm or taller. This is our base rate.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** 80% shorter than 185cm, 20% 185cm or taller. This suggests the neighborhood might have a slightly higher proportion of taller people.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood information over the city-wide data. The neighborhood statistics suggest a higher likelihood of the attacker being 185cm or taller. 

**Estimate**

While we don't have enough information to be exact, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than the neighborhood average, considering we don't know other factors that might have influenced the attacker's characteristics.

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.25
}
``` 

**Important Note:**  This is just an estimate based on limited information. Other factors could influence the actual probability.
