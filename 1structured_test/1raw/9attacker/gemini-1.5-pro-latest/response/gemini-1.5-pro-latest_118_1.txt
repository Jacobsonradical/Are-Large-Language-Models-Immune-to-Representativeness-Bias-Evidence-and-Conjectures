Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This acts as our base rate, a general idea of height distribution.  It tells us 15% of the city population is 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is more specific to the crime scene. It tells us that this neighborhood has a higher proportion of taller people (20%) compared to the city average.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to consider the neighborhood's height distribution rather than the entire city's. The higher concentration of taller people in the neighborhood increases the likelihood that the attacker is also taller.

**Estimation**

While we can't be 100% certain, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller would be closer to the neighborhood's proportion:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate. Other factors could influence the attacker's height, and we only have statistical information, not definitive proof.
