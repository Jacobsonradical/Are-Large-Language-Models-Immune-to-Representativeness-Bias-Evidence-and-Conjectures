Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** Provide a general baseline but aren't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:**  These are crucial because the attack happened in this specific location.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city's.  

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Explanation**

There's a 20% chance (or a probability of 0.20) that a randomly selected person from the neighborhood where the attack occurred is 185 cm or taller. This is the most relevant information we have to estimate the attacker's height.
