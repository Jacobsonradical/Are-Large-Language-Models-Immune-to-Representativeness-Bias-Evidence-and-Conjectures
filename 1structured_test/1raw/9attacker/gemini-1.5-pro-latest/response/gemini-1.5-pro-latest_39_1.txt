Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:** This acts as our base rate or prior knowledge. It tells us the general distribution of heights in the city.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is more specific information relevant to our case. The attack happened in this neighborhood, making this data more important.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city's general distribution. 

**Calculation**

The neighborhood data tells us that 20% of people in that area are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
