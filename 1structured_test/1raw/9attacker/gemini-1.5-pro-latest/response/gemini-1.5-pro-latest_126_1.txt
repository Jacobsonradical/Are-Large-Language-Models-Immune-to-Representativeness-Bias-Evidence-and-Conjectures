Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Focus on the relevant information:** The key here is the neighborhood's height distribution, as that's where the attack happened. The city's overall distribution is less important.
* **Use the neighborhood data:**  You're told 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

There's a 20% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood demographics.
