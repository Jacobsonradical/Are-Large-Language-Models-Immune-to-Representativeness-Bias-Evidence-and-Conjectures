Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide statistics:** Provide a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood statistics:** Offer more specific information about the area of the attack.  Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, this information is more relevant than the city-wide data.

**Estimating the Probability**

While we don't know for sure, it's more likely that the attacker came from the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Therefore, we should base our estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution.

* In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
