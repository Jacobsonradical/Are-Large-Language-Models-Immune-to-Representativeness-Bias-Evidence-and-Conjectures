Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  This gives us a general idea, but the neighborhood information is more relevant.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is crucial! It tells us the height distribution in the area where the attack happened. 

**Logic**

Since we have specific information about the neighborhood where the attack took place, we should prioritize that information over the city-wide statistics.  It's more likely that the attacker is someone from the neighborhood.

**Calculation**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is directly given by the neighborhood statistic: 20%.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
