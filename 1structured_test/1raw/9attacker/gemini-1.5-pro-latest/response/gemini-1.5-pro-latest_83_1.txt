Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** 15% of the city's population is 185cm or taller. This is our base rate.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) than the city average.

**Logic**

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood with a higher proportion of people 185cm or taller, it's more likely the attacker was also taller than the city average would suggest.  However, we don't have enough information to definitively say the probability is 20%. 

**Estimate**

We need to make an estimate that lies somewhere between the city-wide probability (15% or 0.15) and the neighborhood probability (20% or 0.20).

A reasonable estimate, considering the neighborhood information, would be slightly higher than the city average.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.18} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate. Without more information about the attacker or the circumstances of the attack, we cannot be more precise.
