Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:** This provides general information but isn't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is crucial because the attack occurred in this specific neighborhood, and the height distribution here differs from the city as a whole.

**Focusing on the Relevant Information**

We need to determine the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller *given* that the attack happened in this particular neighborhood.  The information about the city-wide height distribution is irrelevant in this case.

**The Answer**

Since 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was this height is simply the same percentage.

{
"probability": 0.20
