Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant since we have specific information about the neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information. The attacker was more likely to be someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to use this percentage as our estimate of the attacker's height.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
