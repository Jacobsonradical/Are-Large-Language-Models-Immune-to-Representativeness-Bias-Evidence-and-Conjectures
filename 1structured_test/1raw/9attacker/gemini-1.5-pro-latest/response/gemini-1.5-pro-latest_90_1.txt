Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:**  This provides a general background but isn't directly useful since the attack was localized.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is the crucial information. The attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should base our estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution.  We're told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
