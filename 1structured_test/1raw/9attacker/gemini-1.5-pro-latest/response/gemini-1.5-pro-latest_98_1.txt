Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This gives us a general idea, but it's less relevant than the neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This is the crucial piece. The attacker was from the neighborhood where the attack happened, making this our primary focus.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller,  it's reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker belonging to that height group is also 20%.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
