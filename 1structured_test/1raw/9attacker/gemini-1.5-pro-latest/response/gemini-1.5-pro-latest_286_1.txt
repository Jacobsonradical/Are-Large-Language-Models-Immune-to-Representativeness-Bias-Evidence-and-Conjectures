Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This gives us a general idea, but it's less important than the specific neighborhood information.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information because the attack happened in this specific neighborhood. 

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of people are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate of the attacker being that height is simply that percentage.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
