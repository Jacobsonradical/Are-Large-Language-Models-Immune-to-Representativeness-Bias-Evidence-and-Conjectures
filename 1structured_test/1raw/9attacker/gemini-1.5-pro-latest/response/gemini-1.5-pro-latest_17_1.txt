Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Gives us a general sense of height distribution, but it's less relevant to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is the crucial information. It tells us the height distribution within the area where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should rely on that data.  We are told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
