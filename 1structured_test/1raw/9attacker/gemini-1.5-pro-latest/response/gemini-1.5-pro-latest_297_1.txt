Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Data:**  This acts as our base rate or prior probability. It tells us that in general, there's a 15% chance of someone in the city being 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood Data:** This is more specific information related to the event.  It suggests the area where the attack happened has a higher concentration (20%) of people 185cm or taller compared to the city average.

**Logic**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood data over the city-wide data.  The neighborhood information gives us a more localized and potentially accurate picture of the suspect pool.

**Estimate**

While we can't be certain, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller should be closer to the neighborhood percentage. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
