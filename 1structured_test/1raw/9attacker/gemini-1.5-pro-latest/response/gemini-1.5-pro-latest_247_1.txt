Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Statistics:**  Provide a general distribution of height, which is less relevant to the specific neighborhood of the attack.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is crucial because it reflects the height distribution within the pool of potential attackers.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should rely on that information.  We are told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
