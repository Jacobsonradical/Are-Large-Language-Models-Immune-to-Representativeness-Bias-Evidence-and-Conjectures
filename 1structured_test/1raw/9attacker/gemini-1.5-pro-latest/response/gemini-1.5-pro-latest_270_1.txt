Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  The city's height distribution provides a general baseline.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average (15%). 

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, it's more relevant to consider the neighborhood's height distribution rather than the city's.  The attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, a reasonable estimate for the probability is:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

**Important Note:**  This is just an estimate. Without more information, we cannot definitively say the attacker's height. Other factors could influence the likelihood, such as the time of day and the attacker's reason for being in that neighborhood.
