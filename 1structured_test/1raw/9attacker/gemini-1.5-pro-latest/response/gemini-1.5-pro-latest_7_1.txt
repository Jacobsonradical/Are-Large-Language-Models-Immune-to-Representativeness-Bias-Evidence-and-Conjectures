Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:** This gives us general information, but it's less relevant than the neighborhood data.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information because the attack happened in this specific neighborhood. 

**The Key:** Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with a known height distribution, we should base our probability estimate on that information.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Explanation:** There's a 20% chance that a randomly selected person from the neighborhood where the attack occurred is 185 cm or taller.  While we don't have enough information to say for certain the attacker's height, this is the best estimate we can make given the available data.
