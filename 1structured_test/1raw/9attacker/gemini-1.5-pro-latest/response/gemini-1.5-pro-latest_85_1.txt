Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** This tells us the general height distribution, but it's less relevant to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is the crucial information, as it reflects the height distribution where the attack happened.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should base our estimate on the neighborhood's height distribution:

* **20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.**

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based on this neighborhood statistic. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
