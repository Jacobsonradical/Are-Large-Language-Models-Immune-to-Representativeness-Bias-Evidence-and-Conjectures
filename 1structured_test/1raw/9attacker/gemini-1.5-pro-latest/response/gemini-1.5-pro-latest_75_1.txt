Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide distribution:**  This information is less relevant since we know the attack happened in a specific neighborhood with a different height distribution.
* **Neighborhood distribution:** This is the crucial information.  The fact that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller is the most relevant piece of data.

**Estimating the Probability**

Given that we have no other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
