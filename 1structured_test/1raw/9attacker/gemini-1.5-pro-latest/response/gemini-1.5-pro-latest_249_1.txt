Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Focus on the relevant information:** The key piece of information is the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. The city's overall height distribution is less relevant.
* **Use the neighborhood data:**  We know that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller. 

Since we have no other information about the attacker, our best estimate of the probability is based on the neighborhood demographics.

**Therefore, the answer is:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
