Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Provides a general distribution of heights but isn't directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is crucial. It tells us the height distribution within the area where the attack occurred.

**Focusing on Relevant Information**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, we should rely on the neighborhood's height distribution.  We are told that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

**Estimate**

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is based directly on the neighborhood data.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
