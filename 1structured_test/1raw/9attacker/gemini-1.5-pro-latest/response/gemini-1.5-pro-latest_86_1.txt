Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We're focusing on the neighborhood:** The city-wide statistics are less relevant since we know the attack happened in a specific neighborhood.
* **Use the neighborhood information:** In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185cm or taller.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability is:

**{probability: 0.20}** 

This assumes the attacker is equally likely to be any resident of the neighborhood. In reality, other factors could influence the probability, but without more information, this is the best estimate based on the given data.
