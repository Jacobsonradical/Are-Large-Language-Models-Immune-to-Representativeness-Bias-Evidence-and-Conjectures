Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline, but aren't directly useful since the attack was localized.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:**  This is the crucial information.  The attacker is more likely to be someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood statistics:

* 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller. 

Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is 20%.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20}
