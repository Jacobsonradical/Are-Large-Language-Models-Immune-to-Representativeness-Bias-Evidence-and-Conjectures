Here's how to approach this problem:

The information about the city's overall height distribution is less relevant than the specific information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred.  We should focus on the neighborhood data.

Given that in the neighborhood:

* 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm
* 20% of people are 185 cm or taller

Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

**{probability: 0.20}**
