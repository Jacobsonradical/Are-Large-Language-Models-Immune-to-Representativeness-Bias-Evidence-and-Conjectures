Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** Provides a general distribution of heights.
* **Neighborhood data:**  Gives a more specific distribution relevant to the crime scene.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in the specific neighborhood, the height distribution within that neighborhood is more relevant than the city-wide data.  It's more likely the attacker is someone from the neighborhood.

**Estimate**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is best estimated using the neighborhood data. 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
