Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide data:** This gives us a general understanding of height distribution but might not be directly applicable to the specific neighborhood.
* **Neighborhood data:** This is the more relevant information, suggesting a higher proportion of taller people in the area where the attack occurred.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood data.  Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **closer to the neighborhood proportion**.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.20} 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimate. In a real investigation, factors like time of day (potentially influencing who was out and about), witness statements (if any), and other evidence would be crucial in determining the likelihood of the attacker's height.
