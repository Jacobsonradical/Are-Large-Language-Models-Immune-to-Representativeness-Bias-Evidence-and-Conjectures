Here's how we can approach this problem:

* **Base Rate:** The city-wide statistics provide a base rate. There, a random person has a 15% chance of being 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood Information:**  The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average. This information is more relevant to the potential attacker.

Since the attack happened in this specific neighborhood, it makes more sense to prioritize the neighborhood's height distribution over the city's average. 

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.20} 

We estimate that there's a 20% probability the attacker was 185cm or taller.
