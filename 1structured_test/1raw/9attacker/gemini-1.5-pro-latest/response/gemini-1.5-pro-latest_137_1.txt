Here's how to approach this problem:

* **We have a prior probability:** The city's population gives us a baseline. There's a 15% chance a random person is 185cm or taller.
* **We have new information:** The neighborhood's demographics differ from the city overall. This information should update our belief.

Since the neighborhood has a higher concentration of people 185cm or taller (20%) than the city average (15%), it's more likely the attacker belongs to this taller group.

**Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller should be higher than 15% but less than 20%.**  It's difficult to give an exact number without more sophisticated analysis. 

Here's a possible answer, acknowledging the uncertainty:

**{probability: 0.175}** 

This represents a slight increase from the city average, reflecting the neighborhood's demographics.
