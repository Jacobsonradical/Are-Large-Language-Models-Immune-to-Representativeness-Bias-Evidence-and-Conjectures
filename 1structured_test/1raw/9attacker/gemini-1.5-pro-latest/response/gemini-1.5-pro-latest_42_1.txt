Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** This information acts as our base rate. It tells us the general distribution of heights in the city.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** This information is more specific and likely more relevant to the case. It tells us the height distribution in the area where the attack happened.

**Logic**

Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the neighborhood statistics over the city-wide statistics. The neighborhood has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) compared to the city average (15%).

**Estimate**

While we can't be certain, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller should be closer to the neighborhood statistic. 

**Answer**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
``` 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate.  Without more information about the attacker, we cannot definitively determine their height.
