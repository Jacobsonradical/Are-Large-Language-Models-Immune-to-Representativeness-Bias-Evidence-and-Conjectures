Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide Statistics:**  Provide a general baseline but aren't as directly relevant to the specific crime.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:**  More important as they reflect the potential pool of attackers in the vicinity.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since the attack happened in the neighborhood with its own height distribution, we should prioritize that information. We are told that 20% of people in that neighborhood are 185cm or taller. This directly translates to the probability we are looking for.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}
