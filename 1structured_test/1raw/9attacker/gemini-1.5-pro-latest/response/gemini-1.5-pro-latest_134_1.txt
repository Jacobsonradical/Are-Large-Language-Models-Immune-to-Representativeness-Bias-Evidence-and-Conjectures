Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City Statistics:** Provide a general baseline.
* **Neighborhood Statistics:** More relevant to the case since the attack occurred there.  The higher concentration of taller people in the neighborhood is crucial information.

**Estimating the Probability**

While we don't have definitive proof, it's more likely the attacker came from the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Therefore, we should base our estimate on the neighborhood statistics.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**  There's a 20% chance (0.2 probability) that someone from the neighborhood where the attack took place is 185cm or taller. This is our best estimate given the available information.
