Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide height distribution:**  This acts as our base rate or prior knowledge. It tells us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller.
* **Neighborhood height distribution:** This information is more specific to the situation.  It suggests the attacker is more likely to be from the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood, we should prioritize the information about that neighborhood's height distribution. It's more relevant than the city-wide average.

**Estimate**

Given that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185cm or taller, our best estimate of the attacker being 185cm or taller is 20%.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"probability": 0.20 
}
```
