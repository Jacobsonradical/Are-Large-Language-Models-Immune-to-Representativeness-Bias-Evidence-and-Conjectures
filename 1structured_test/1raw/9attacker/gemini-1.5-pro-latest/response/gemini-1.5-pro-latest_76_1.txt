Here's how we can approach this problem:

The most relevant information is the height distribution within the neighborhood where the attack occurred. We know:

* **Neighborhood Height Distribution:** 80% shorter than 185 cm, 20% 185 cm or taller.

Since we lack specific details about the attacker, the best estimate of their height is based on the general population of the neighborhood.

**Therefore, our estimate is:**

{probability: 0.20} 

This means there's a 20% probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the neighborhood demographics.
