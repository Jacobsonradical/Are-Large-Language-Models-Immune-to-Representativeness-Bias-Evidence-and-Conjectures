Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **City-wide:** 15% of people are 185cm or taller. This is our base rate.
* **Neighborhood Specifics:** The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher concentration of taller people (20%) than the city average.

**Reasoning**

Since the attack happened in a neighborhood with a higher proportion of taller people, it's more likely the attacker was 185cm or taller than if the attack had occurred in a random location in the city.  We should adjust our probability estimate upwards from the city average to reflect this.

**Estimation**

While we don't have enough information to calculate the exact probability, we can make an informed estimate. Consider:

* **If we only had the city data,** our estimate would be 0.15 (15%).
* **The neighborhood data suggests** the probability should be higher than 0.15. 

A reasonable estimate, considering the neighborhood information, might be somewhere between 0.20 (20%) and 0.25. 

**Answer**

Let's choose a value within that range:

```json
{
"probability": 0.22 
}
```

**Important Note:** This is an estimate.  A more precise calculation would require additional information about the distribution of heights within the neighborhood and how it compares to the city's overall distribution.
