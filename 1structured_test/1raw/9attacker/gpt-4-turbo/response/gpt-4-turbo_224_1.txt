Given the situation, the most relevant information to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller comes from the neighborhood data, as it represents the most specific and localized demographic data available. 

According to the police investigation data:
- 80% of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, we estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is based on the population statistics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

{probability: 0.2}
