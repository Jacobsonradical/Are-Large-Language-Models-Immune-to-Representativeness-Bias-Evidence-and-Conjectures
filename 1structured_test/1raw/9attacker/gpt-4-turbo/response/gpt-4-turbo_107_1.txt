Given the information provided and without any specific indication that the attacker's height differs from the general distribution in the neighborhood, the simplest assumption is to use the proportional distribution of heights in the neighborhood as the basis for estimating the likelihood of the attacker's height.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Hence, the probability estimate that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller, given that we do not have other distinguishing information, would be directly taken from the proportions in the neighborhood.
