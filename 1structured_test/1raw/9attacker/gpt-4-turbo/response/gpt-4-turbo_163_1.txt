Given the lack of specific evidence about the attacker's height from the victim's encounter and based purely on the demographic data provided for the neighborhood:

- 20% (0.20) of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, without additional information about the attacker, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller is based on this proportion of the population in that neighborhood.

{probability: 0.20}
