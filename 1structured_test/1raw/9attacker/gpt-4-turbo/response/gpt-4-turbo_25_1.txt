Given the information, we don't have specific data about the height of the attacker, other than general population distributions in both the city and the neighborhood.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to focus on the data relevant to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as this is most pertinent to the situation:

- \( 20\% \) (or \( 0.20 \)) of the neighborhood population is 185 cm or taller.

Assuming no other information (such as height-related trends in crime), the probability estimate should reflect the distribution in the immediate population where the attack happened. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is directly based on the demographic proportion:

{probability: 0.20}
