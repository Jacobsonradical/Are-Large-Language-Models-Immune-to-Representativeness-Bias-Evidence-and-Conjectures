Based on the information provided and considering the increased likelihood that the population of the neighborhood where the attack occurred reflects the demographics involved in the crime, it would be reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as aligned with the neighborhood distribution.

Thus, the assessment would be: 

{probability: 0.20}
