Given the information provided and without further evidence specific to the attacker beyond the neighborhood statistics, the best estimate for the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller would be based on the local demographic data of the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

According to the details:

- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the probability estimate that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based solely on the population distribution in the neighborhood, is 0.20 (or 20%).
