Given the information that in the neighborhood of the attack, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the neighborhood demographics, as this is the most specific information available for the area where the crime occurred.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}
