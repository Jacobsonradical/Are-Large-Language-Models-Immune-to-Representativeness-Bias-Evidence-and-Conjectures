To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the information specifically about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since it provides a more accurate reflection of the potential pool from which the attacker might come.

From the information given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack happened, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the demographic data for that specific neighborhood, is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
