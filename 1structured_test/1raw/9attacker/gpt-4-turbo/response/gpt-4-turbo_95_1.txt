Given the information from the attack location, we know that within the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, the population distribution regarding height is different from the overall city's demographics. Since the neighborhood-specific proportions are likely more pertinent to estimating the characteristics of the attacker, we should use these figures for our estimate.

In the neighborhood:
- 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based solely on the information available about the neighborhood distribution, would be 0.20 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.20}
