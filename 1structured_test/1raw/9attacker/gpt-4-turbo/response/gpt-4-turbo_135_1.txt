Given the information provided, the best estimate we have of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is based on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the neighborhood's population consists of 20% people who are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker falls into this height category is also 20%.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
