Given that the occurrence took place in a neighborhood where the statistic differs from that of the broader city, we can use only the local demographic information relevant to the area of the attack.

Based on the information provided:
- In the neighborhood, 80% (or 0.8) of the population are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% (or 0.2) of the population are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height and there are no additional indications of the attackerâ€™s height, the best estimate we can rely on is the percentage distribution of the heights in the neighborhood:

{probability: 0.2}
