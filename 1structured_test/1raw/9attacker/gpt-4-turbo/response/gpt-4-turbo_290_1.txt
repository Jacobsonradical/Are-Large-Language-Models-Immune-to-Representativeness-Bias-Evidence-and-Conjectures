Given the information provided, the estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is derived from the demographic distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since it's stated that in this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being of this height group based solely on this local demographic data.

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
