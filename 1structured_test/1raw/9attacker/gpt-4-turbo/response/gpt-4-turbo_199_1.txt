Given the data you've provided, and the lack of any information specifically linking the attack to any height attribute beyond the general population statistics, the most reasonable assumption is to base the estimation on the population distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In this neighborhood, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Without additional specific evidence pointing to a particular height range of the attacker, this is the best estimate available.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
