{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.2 (or 20%) based on the information provided about the population in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This is because 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, which means that the remaining 20% are 185 cm or taller. The victim's inability to see the attacker's height does not affect this estimate.
