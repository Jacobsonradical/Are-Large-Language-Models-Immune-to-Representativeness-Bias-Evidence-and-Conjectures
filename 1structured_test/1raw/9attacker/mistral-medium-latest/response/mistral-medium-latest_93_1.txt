{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The question states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. This is the most relevant statistic for estimating the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as it pertains specifically to the location of the crime. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.20.
