{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Given that the police investigation reveals that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as 0.2. This estimate is based on the information specific to the neighborhood, rather than the general population of the city.
