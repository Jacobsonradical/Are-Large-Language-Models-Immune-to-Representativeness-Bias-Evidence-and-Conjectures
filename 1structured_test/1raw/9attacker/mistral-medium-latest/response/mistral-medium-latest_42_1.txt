{probability: 0.2}

Based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2, as 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. This estimate is based on the assumption that the attacker is a resident of the neighborhood and their height follows the same distribution as the general population in that area. It is important to note that this is an estimate and the actual probability could be different.
