{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it is more likely that the attacker's height follows the distribution of heights in that area. Given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
