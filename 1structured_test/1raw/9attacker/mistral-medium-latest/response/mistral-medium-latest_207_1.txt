{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, this suggests that it is more likely that the attacker belongs to this group. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%.
