{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Given that the police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, 20 % of the people are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as 0.2.

Note: This is an estimate based on the information provided and does not take into account other factors that may influence the attacker's height.
