{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood and the police investigation revealed the proportion of people's heights in that area, it's more reasonable to use the neighborhood's statistics to estimate the probability. In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, so the estimated probability is 0.20.
