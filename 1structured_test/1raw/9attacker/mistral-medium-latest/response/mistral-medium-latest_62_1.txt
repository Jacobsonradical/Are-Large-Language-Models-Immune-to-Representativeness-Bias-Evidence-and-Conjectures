{probability: 0.2}

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%, based on the information provided about the neighborhood in which the attack occurred. The city-wide statistics do not apply here, as the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with a different distribution of heights. Therefore, the relevant information is that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.
