{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The question states that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Given that there is no other information provided, it is reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as 0.20, based on the demographics of the neighborhood.
