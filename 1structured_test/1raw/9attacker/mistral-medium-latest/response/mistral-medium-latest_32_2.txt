{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the information that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood. Since the attack happened at night and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we can only use the information about the population distribution in the neighborhood to make an estimate.

According to the police investigation, in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

It's worth noting that this is only an estimate based on the available information and there may be other factors that could affect the probability. For example, if the attacker was a man, the probability could be higher than 0.20, since men are generally taller than women. However, without additional information, we cannot make a more precise estimate.
