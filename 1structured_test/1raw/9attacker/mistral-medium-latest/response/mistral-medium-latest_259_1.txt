{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20 (or 20%), based on the information that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This is the most relevant and specific information available for estimating the probability.
