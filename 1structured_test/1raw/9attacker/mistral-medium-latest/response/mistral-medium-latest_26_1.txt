{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.20 as a decimal. This estimation is based on the information that the attack occurred in the neighborhood and the given height distribution in that area. Note that this is an estimate and not a definitive answer, as there could be other factors at play that are not mentioned in the provided information.
