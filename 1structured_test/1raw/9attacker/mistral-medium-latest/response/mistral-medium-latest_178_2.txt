{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood and the police provided the statistics for that specific area, it is more relevant to use those statistics to estimate the probability of the attacker's height. The information about the city's population, in general, is less relevant in this case.

The police investigation found that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack took place are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
