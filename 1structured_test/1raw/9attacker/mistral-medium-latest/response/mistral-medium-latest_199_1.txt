{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

The attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, it is more relevant to use the neighborhood's statistics than the general city population statistics. So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
