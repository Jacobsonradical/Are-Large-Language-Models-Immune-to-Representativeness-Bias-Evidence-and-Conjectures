{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The question states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it is reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the height distribution in this neighborhood. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.20.
