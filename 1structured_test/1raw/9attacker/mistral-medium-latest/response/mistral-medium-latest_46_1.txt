probability: 0.2

Explanation:

Given that the police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, 20 % of the people are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as 0.2. This is because the probability is proportional to the percentage of people in that height range in the neighborhood. So, the probability is 0.2 or 20%.
