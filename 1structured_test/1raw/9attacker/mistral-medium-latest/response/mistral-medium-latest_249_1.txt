{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

Although the overall population of the city has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller, the police investigation indicates that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, the proportion is different. In this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
