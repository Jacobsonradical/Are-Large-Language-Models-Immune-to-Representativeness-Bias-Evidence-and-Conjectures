{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood and the police investigation provided the height distribution for that area, it's more appropriate to use the neighborhood's statistics rather than the overall city's population. In this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, hence the estimated probability is 0.20.
