{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:

Given the information that 20% of the people in the specific neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2. This probability is based on the demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred, which is more relevant than the general population statistics for the city.
