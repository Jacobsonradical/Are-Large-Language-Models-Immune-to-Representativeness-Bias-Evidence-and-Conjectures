{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The police investigation reveals that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since this is the most relevant information to the situation, it's appropriate to use the neighborhood's statistics rather than the city's general population statistics when estimating the probability. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).
