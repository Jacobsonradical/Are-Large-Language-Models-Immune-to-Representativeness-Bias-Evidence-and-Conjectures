{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood and the police investigation found that 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller as 0.20. The general population statistics are less relevant in this case, as the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with different proportions.
