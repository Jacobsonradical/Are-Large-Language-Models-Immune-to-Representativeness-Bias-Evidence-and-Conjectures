{probability: 0.2}

This is based on the information provided that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker also comes from this neighborhood and therefore the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.2. Note that this is an estimate and not a definitive answer, as there could be other factors that might affect the probability.
