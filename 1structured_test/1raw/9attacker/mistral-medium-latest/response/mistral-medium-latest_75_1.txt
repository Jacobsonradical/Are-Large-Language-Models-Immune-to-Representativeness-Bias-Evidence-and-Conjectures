{probability: 0.2}

Explanation: The police investigation indicates that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since this information is more relevant and specific to the case, we should use it to estimate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.2.
