{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20 or 20%, based on the information provided about the neighborhood in which the attack occurred. This is because 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. The information about the overall population of the city is not relevant to this estimate, as the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with different demographics.
