{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the police investigation revealed that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is estimated that the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is 0.20. This is based on the local demographics of the neighborhood where the crime took place, rather than the general population of the city.
