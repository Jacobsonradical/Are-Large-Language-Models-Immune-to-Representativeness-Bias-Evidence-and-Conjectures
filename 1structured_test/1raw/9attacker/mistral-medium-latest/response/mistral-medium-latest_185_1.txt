{probability: 0.20}

The probability estimate is based on the information that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This information is more relevant to the case compared to the general population statistics for the entire city. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 or 20%.
