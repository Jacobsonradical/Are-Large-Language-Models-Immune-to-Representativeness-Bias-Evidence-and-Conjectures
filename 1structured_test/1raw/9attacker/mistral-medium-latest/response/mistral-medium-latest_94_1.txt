{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, it is more appropriate to use the height distribution of the neighborhood's population. In this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%).
