{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

Given that the police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20 % are 185 cm or taller, it is estimated that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
