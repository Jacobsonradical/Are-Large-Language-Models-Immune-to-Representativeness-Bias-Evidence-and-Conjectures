{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, it's more appropriate to use the height distribution of that area for estimating the probability. In this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
