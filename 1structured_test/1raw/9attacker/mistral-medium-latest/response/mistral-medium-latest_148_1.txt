{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

The problem states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. Since the attack happened in this neighborhood, we should use this percentage to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, rather than the percentages for the entire city. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.20.
