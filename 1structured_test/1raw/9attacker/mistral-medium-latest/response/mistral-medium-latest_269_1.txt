{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood and the police investigation discovered the local statistics, it's more relevant to use the neighborhood's height distribution rather than the general city's distribution. In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, so the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
