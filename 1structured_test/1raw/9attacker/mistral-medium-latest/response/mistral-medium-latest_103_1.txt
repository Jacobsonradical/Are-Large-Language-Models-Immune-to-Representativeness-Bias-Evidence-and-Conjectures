{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20 (or 20%), based on the information provided about the neighborhood in which the attack occurred. The victim could not see the attacker's height, so we can only use the statistics about the population in that specific neighborhood. According to the police investigation, 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.20.
