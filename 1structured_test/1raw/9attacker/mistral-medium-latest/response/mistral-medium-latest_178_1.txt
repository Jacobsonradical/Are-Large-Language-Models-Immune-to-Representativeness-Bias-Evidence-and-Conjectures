{probability: 0.2, or 20%}

Explanation:

The probability estimate should be based on the information that the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood where 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%.
