{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This is the most relevant information to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability is 0.2 or 20%.
