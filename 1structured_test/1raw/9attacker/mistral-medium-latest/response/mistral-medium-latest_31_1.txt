{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is more appropriate to use the local demographic data rather than the city-wide statistics. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 or 20%.
