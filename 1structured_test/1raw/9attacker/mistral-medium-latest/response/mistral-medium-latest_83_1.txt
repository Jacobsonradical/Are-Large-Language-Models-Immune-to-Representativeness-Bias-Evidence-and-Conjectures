{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The problem states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, we should use this percentage to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability is 0.20.
