{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood and 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, it is more appropriate to use the local demographics rather than the general population statistics for the city. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
