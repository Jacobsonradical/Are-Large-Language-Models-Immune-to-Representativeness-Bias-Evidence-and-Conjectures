{probability: 0.20}

This is because the police investigation found that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. This is the most relevant information for estimating the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. The overall population statistics for the city are less relevant, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.20.
