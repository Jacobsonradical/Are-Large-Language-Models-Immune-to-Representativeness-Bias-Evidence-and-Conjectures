{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood. Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we can only use the information about the height distribution in the neighborhood to make an estimate. The police investigation discovered that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, so our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

Note that the information about the height distribution in the city as a whole is not relevant to this estimate, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with its own height distribution.
