{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood and we have height distribution data for that area, it makes sense to use the neighborhood statistics rather than the overall city statistics. In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, so the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
