{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the information that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.2 or 20%.
