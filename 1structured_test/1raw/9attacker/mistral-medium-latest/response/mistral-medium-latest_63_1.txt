{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, it's more reasonable to use the height distribution of that neighborhood for estimating the probability. In this neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
