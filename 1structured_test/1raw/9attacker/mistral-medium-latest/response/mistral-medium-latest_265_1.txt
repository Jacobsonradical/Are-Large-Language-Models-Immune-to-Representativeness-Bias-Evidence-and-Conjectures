{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the police investigation found that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller, it is estimated that the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is 0.20. This information is more specific to the location where the attack occurred, so it should be used instead of the general population statistics for the city.
