{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The police investigation found that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This information is more specific to the context of the crime than the general population statistics for the city. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).
