{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

The problem states that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This information is more relevant to the case than the general city population statistics. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
