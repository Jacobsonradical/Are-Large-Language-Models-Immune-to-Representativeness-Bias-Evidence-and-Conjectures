{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, the relevant height distribution is the one for that neighborhood, not the general city population. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20% or 0.20, based on the neighborhood's height distribution.
