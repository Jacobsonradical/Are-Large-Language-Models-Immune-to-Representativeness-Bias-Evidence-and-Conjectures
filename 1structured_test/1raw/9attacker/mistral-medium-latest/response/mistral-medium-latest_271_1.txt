{probability: 0.20}

The probability estimate is based on the fact that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. This information is more specific to the location of the attack than the city-wide statistics, and therefore it is more relevant to the estimation of the attacker's height.
