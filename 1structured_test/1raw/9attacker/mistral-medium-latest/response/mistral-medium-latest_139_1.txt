{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood. Since we don't have any other information about the attacker, the most reasonable estimate is based on the height distribution in that neighborhood. The police investigation discovered that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, so the estimated probability is 0.20.
