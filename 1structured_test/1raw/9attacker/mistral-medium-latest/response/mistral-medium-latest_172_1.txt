{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the police investigation found that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2. The city-wide statistics are less relevant in this case, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with different demographics.
