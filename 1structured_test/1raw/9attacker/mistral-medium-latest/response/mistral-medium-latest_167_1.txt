{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, the distribution of heights in that area is more relevant than the overall city population. The police investigation found that 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
