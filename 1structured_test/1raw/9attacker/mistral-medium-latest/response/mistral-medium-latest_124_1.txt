{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%. Therefore, the probability is 0.20.

Note that the city-wide percentage does not affect this estimate, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with different demographics.
