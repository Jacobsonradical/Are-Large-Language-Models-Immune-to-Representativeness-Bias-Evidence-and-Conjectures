{probability: 0.2, also known as 20%}

Explanation:
The police investigation revealed that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on this information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (equivalent to 20%).
