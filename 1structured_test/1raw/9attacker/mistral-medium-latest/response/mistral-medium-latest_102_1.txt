{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, the relevant height distribution is that of the neighborhood, which is 80% shorter than 185 cm and 20% 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
