{probability: 0.20}

Here's the reasoning:
1. The police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, we should use these percentages to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
3. Therefore, our estimate is that there is a 20% chance (or 0.20 probability) that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
