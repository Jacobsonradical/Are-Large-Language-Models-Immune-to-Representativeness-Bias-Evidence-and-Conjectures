{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, it is more relevant to use the height distribution of people in that neighborhood rather than the overall city population. In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
