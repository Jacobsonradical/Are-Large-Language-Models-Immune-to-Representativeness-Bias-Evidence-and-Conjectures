{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The question states that in the specific neighborhood where the attack took place, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since this information is more relevant to the case than the general population statistics for the entire city, we should use the neighborhood's statistics to estimate the probability. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
