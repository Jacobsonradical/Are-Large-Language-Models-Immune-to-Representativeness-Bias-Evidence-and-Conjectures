{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The question states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. This information is more specific to the situation than the general city population statistics, so it is more relevant for estimating the probability of the attacker's height. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (20%).
