{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).
