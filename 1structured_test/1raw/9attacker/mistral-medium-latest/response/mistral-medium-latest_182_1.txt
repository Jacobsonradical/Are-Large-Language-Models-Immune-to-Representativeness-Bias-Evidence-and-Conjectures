{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The question states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2. This is because the attacker is more likely to come from the same neighborhood where the attack occurred, and the population distribution in that neighborhood is different than the city as a whole.
