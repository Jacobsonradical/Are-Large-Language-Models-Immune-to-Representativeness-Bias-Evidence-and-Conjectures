{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The police investigation indicates that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Thus, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

Note that the overall city population distribution (85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller) is not relevant here, as the police investigation focuses on the specific neighborhood demographics.
