{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

Given that the police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as 0.20 (or 20%) based on the information provided. The fact that the victim could not see the attacker's height does not affect this estimate.
