Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the attacker was from the neighborhood where the attack occurred rather than from the general city population. Therefore, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2, or 20%}

This is based on the statistic that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

{note: This is an estimate based on the information provided and does not take into account other factors that may be relevant in determining the attacker's height.}
