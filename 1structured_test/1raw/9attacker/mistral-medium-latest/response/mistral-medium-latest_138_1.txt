{probability: 0.20}

Based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%), as this is the percentage of people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred who are 185 cm or taller. The city-wide distribution of heights is less relevant in this case, as the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with its own height distribution.
