{probability: 0.20}

The probability estimate that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20, based on the information that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. This information is more specific to the crime scene and therefore more relevant than the general population statistics for the city.
