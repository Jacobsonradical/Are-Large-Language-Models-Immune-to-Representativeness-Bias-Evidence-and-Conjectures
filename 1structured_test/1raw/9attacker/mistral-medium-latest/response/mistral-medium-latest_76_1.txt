{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is more relevant to use the local demographics rather than the overall city population percentages when estimating the probability of the attacker's height. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.20.
