{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, it's more appropriate to use the height distribution of the people in that neighborhood for the estimation. In this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
