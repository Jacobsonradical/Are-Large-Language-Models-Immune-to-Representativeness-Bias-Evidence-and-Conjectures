{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood and we have the height distribution for that area, it is more appropriate to use the neighborhood's statistics rather than the city's overall statistics. In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, so the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
