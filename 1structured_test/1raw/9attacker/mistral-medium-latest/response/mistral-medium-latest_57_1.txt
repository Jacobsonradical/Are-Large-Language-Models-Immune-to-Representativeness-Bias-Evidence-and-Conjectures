{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

Since the attack happened at night and the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we don't have any specific information about the attacker other than the general height distribution in the neighborhood where the crime occurred.

According to the police investigation, 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, it is reasonable to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as 0.20.
