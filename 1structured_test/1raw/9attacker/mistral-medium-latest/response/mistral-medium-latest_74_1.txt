{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

The police investigation found that in the neighborhood where the attack happened, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is based on the local population. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.20.
