{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is more appropriate to use this local statistic rather than the overall city statistic. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (or 20%).
