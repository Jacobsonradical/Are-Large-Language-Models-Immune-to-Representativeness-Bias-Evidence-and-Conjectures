{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, it's more appropriate to use the height distribution of that neighborhood's population instead of the general city population. According to the information provided, 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
