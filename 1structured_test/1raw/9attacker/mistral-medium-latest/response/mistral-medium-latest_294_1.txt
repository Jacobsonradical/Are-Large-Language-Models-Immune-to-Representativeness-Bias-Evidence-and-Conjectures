{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

The question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 or 20%.
