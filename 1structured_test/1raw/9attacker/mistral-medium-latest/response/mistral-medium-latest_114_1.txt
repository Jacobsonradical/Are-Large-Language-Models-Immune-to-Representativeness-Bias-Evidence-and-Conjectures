{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, we should use the height distribution of that area for our estimate. In this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, so the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
