{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, and there is no other information provided, the most reasonable estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%). This percentage is based on the demographics of the neighborhood where the attack took place, not the overall city population percentages.
