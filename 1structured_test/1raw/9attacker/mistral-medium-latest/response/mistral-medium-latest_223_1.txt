{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The police investigation found that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20. This is based on the information available about the height distribution in the specific neighborhood and not the general population of the city.
