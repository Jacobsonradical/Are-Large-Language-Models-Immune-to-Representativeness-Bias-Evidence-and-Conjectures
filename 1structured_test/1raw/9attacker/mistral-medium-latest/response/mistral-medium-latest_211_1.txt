{probability: 0.20}

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20 (or 20%), based on the information provided about the demographics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This estimate takes into account the specific context of the situation, which suggests that the neighborhood's population may be more relevant than the overall population of the city. However, it's important to note that this is still just an estimate and there may be other factors that could influence the actual probability.
