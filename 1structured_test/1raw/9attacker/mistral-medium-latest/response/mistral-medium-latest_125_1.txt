{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the police investigation discovered that in the specific neighborhood where the attack took place, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is more accurate to use this statistic instead of the general population statistics for the entire city. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
