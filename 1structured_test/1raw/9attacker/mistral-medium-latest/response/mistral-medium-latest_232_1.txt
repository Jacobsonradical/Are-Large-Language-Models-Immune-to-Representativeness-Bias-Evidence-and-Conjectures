{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:

Since the investigation revealed that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is estimated that the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

It is important to note that this is an estimate based on the information provided and does not take into account any other factors that could potentially affect the probability, such as the victim's ability to accurately judge the attacker's height or any other contextual clues.
