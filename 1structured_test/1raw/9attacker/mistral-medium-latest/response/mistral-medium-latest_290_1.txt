{probability: 0.2}

This estimate is based on the information provided about the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it is reasonable to use this percentage as an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Note: This is an estimate and not a definitive probability, as there may be other factors that could affect the probability of the attacker's height. For example, if the attack occurred in an area of the neighborhood that is predominantly populated by taller people, the probability could be higher than 20%. Conversely, if the attack occurred in an area that is predominantly populated by shorter people, the probability could be lower than 20%. Without further information, it is not possible to make a more precise estimate.
