{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The question states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller, and this is the most relevant information for estimating the probability of the attacker's height. Therefore, based on this information, the estimated probability is 0.2 or 20%.
