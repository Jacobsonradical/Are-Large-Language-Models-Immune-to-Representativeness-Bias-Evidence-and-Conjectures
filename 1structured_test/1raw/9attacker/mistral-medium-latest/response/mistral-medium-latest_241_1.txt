Based on the information provided, it seems more likely that the attacker is from the local neighborhood where the attack occurred, as opposed to being a random individual from the entire city. Therefore, we should use the proportions from the neighborhood to estimate the probability.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.20 in decimal form. So the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
