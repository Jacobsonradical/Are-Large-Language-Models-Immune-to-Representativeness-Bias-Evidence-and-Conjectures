{probability: 0.20}

The probability estimate is based on the information provided about the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This is the most relevant and specific information for estimating the probability of the attacker's height. The city-wide statistics are less relevant in this case.
