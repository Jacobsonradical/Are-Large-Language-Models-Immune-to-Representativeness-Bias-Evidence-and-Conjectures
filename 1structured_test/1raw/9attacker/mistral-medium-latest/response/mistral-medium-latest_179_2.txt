{probability: 0.2}

Based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2, which corresponds to the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller. This is because the victim could not see the attacker's height, and the only relevant information available is the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
