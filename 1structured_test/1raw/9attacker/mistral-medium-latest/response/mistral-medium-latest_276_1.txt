{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it is more relevant to use the neighborhood's height distribution for estimating the probability. In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, so the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
