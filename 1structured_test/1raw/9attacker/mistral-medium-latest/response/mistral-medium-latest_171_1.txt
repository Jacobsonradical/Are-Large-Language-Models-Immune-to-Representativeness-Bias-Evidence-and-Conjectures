{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The question states that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This is the most relevant information for estimating the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as it reflects the distribution of heights in the specific area where the attack took place. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.20, or 20%.
