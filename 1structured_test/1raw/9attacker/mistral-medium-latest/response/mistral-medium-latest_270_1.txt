{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2. This is based on the information specific to the neighborhood where the attack occurred, rather than the general population of the city.
