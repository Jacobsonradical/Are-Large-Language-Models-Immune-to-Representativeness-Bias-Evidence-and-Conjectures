{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, it's more likely that the height distribution of the attacker follows the neighborhood's height distribution rather than the overall city's height distribution. The police investigation revealed that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
