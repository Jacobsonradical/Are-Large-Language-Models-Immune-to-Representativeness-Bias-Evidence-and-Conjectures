{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with different height distribution compared to the overall city population, it's more reasonable to estimate the probability based on the neighborhood's height distribution. In this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
