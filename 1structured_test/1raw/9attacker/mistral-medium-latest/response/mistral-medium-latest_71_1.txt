{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the information provided about the population in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.20 or 20%.
