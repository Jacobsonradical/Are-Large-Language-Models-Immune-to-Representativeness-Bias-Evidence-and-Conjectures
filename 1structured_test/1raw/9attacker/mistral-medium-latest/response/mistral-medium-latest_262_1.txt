{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is more relevant to use this information as the basis for the estimate. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (or 20%).
