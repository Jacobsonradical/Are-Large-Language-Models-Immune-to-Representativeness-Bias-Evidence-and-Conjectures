{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The question states that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2. This is based on the information provided about the population in the specific neighborhood, rather than the general population of the city.
