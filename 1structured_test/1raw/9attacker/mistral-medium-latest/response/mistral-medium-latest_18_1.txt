{probability: 0.20}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, the relevant height distribution is that of the neighborhood, not the city as a whole. The police investigation found that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, it is estimated that the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
