{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 20% (or 0.20 as a decimal), based on the information that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. This is the most relevant information for estimating the probability, as it pertains specifically to the area where the attack took place. The city-wide proportions can be used as a rough estimate, but the neighborhood-specific information is likely to be more accurate in this case.
