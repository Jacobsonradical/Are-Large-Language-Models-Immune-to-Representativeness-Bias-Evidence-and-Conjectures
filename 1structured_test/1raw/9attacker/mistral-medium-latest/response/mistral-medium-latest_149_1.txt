{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

Given that the police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20 % are 185 cm or taller, it is more appropriate to use the neighborhood statistics to estimate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.20.
