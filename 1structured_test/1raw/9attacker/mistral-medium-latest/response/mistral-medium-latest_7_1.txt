{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the information that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. Since the attack occurred at night and the victim could not see the attacker's height, the only relevant information is the height distribution in the neighborhood. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.2, which corresponds to the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.
