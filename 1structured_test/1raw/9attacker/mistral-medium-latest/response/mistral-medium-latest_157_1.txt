{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Given that the police investigation discovered that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is more reasonable to estimate the probability based on this local statistic rather than the overall city population. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
