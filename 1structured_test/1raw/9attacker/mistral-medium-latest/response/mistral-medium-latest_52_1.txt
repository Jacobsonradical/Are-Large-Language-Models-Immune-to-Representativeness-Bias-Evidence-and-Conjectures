{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it's more likely that the attacker's height distribution follows that of the neighborhood rather than the overall city population. The police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, so the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
