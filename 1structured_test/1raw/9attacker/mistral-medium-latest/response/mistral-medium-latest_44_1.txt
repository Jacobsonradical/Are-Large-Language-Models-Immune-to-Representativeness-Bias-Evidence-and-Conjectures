{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability estimate should be based on the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific to the case. Given that 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
