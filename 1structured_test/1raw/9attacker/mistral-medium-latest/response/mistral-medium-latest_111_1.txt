{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.20 (or 20%) based on the information provided about the neighborhood in which the attack occurred. This is because 20% of the people in that neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. The city-wide percentages are not relevant here, as the attack took place in a specific neighborhood with different demographics.
