{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20. This information is more specific to the location of the crime and thus more relevant than the general population statistics for the city.
