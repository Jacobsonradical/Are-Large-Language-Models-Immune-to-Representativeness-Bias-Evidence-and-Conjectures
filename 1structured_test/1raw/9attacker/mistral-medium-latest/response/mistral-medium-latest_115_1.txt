{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood and the police investigation provided the statistics for that specific area, it would be more appropriate to use those statistics for the estimation. According to the police investigation, 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, so the estimated probability for the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
