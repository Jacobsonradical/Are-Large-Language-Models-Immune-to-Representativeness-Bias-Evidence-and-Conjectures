{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood and we have information about the height distribution of the people living there, it is reasonable to estimate the probability of the attacker's height based on the neighborhood's population. According to the provided information, 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability estimate for the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
