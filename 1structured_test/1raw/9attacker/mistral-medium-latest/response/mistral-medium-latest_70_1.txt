{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, it is more likely that the attacker's height distribution follows the neighborhood's height distribution rather than the overall city's height distribution. The police investigation found that 20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
