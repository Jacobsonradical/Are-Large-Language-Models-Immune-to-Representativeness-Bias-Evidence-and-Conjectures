{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, it is more relevant to use the height distribution of that neighborhood instead of the entire city. In this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
