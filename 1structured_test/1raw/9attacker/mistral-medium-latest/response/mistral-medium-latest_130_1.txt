{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is more reasonable to use this specific information for estimating the probability of the attacker's height. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
