{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The question specifies that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on the information provided and assuming that the attacker is a resident of the neighborhood, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is 0.20 or 20%.
