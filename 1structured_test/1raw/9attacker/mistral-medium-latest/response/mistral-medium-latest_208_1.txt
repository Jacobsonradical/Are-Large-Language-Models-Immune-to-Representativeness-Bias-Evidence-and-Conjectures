{probability: 0.20}

The probability estimate is based on the fact that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller. Since the attack occurred in this neighborhood, it is more relevant to use the local population distribution rather than the city-wide distribution. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
