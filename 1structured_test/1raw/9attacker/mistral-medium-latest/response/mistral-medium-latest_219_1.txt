{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it's more reasonable to use this local statistic as the basis for estimating the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, rather than the general city population statistic. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.20.
