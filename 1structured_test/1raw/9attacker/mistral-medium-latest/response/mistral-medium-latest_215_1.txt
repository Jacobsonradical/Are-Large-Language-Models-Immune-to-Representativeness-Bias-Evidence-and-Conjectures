{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 20%, or 0.2, based on the information about the neighborhood in which the attack occurred. This is because the police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller and 80% are shorter than 185 cm. The victim's inability to see the attacker's height does not affect this estimate.
