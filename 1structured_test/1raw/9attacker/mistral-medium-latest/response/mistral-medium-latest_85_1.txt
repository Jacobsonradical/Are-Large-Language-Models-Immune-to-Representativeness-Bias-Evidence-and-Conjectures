{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the information that in the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.2.

Note: This estimate assumes that the height distribution of the population in the neighborhood is representative of the height distribution of potential attackers in the area. Additionally, it does not take into account any other information that may be relevant to the case, such as witness statements or physical evidence.
