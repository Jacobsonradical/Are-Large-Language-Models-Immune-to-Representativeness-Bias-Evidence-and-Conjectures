{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is more appropriate to use the local demographic information for estimating the probability of the attacker's height. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.20 or 20%.
