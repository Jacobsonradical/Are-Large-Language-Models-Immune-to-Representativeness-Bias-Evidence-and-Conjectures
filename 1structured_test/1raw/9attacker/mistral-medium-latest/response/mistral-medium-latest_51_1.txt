{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The police investigation discovered that in the neighborhood in which the attack occurred, 20 % of the people are 185 cm or taller. This is the most relevant statistic for estimating the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as it pertains specifically to the area where the attack took place. Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.2.
