{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The question states that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack happened are 185 cm or taller. Since the police investigation focused on the specific area where the crime took place, it is reasonable to use this statistic to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability is 0.20.
