{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the police investigation discovered that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, it is most reasonable to estimate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller based on this local statistic, rather than the general population statistic. Hence, the estimated probability is 0.20.
