{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the specific neighborhood, it is more relevant to use the statistics for that area. In this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on the given information and assuming the attacker is a random person from that neighborhood, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
