{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:

The question states that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, it is estimated that the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

It is important to note that this estimate is based on the information provided about the population of the neighborhood and does not take into account any other factors that may be relevant to the investigation. Additionally, it is worth noting that this estimate is not a certainty and that further investigation may be necessary to determine the attacker's height with greater accuracy.
