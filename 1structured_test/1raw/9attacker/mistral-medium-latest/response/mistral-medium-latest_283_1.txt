{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood with different proportions of people shorter or taller than 185 cm compared to the overall city population, we should use the neighborhood's statistics. According to the police investigation, 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
