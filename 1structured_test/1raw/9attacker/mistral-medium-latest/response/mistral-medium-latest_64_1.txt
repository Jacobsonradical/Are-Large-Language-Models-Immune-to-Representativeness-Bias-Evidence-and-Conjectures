{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the police investigation discovered that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller, we should use this percentage as the probability estimate for the attacker's height, assuming the attacker is a resident of that neighborhood. Therefore, the probability is 0.20.
