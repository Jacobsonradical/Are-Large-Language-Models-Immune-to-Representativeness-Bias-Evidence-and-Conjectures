{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The police investigation found that in the specific neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since this local information is more relevant to the case than the general city population statistics, we should use the neighborhood percentage to estimate the probability. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
