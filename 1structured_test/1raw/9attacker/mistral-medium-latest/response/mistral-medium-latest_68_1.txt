{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, the relevant height distribution is that of the neighborhood, not the city as a whole. According to the information provided, 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20.
