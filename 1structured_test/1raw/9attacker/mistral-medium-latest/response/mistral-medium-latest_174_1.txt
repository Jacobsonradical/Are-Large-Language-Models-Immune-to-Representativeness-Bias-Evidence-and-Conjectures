{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, the most relevant statistics are those of the neighborhood, not the city as a whole. According to the police investigation, 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
