If we don't have any other information about the attacker, the best estimate of the attacker's height would be based on the height distribution of the general population of the city. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
