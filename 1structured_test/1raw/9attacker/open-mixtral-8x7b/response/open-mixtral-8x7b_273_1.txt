Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, I would estimate that the attacker's height was also 185 cm or taller with a probability of:

{probability: 0.20}
