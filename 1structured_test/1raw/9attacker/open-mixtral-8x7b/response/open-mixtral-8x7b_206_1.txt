Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood). However, the victim's inability to see the attacker's height provides some information that should be taken into account.

Given that the attack happened at night and the victim could not see the attacker's height, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker was not clearly illuminated, making it harder to determine height. This fact might make the victim more likely to underestimate the attacker's height.

Therefore, the percentage of potential attackers who are 185 cm or taller, as seen by the victim, might be lower than the actual percentage in the neighborhood.

If we assume that the victim would only be able to accurately estimate the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 50% of the time (when the attacker is clearly taller), then the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, as estimated by the victim, would be:

20% * 0.5 + 100% * 0.5 = 10% + 50% = 60%

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is:

{probability: 0.6}
