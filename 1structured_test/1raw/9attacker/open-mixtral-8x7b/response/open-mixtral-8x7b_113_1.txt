Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, the only information we have to estimate the attacker's height comes from the population data of the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

We are given that 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on the available information, we estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
