Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the percentages given for the city to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We are given that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. Since the attacker was chosen at random from the population of the city, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is also 15%.

However, since we are told that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this provides some evidence that the attacker may have been taller than 185 cm. However, without any further information about the attacker or the circumstances of the attack, it is difficult to make a more precise estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, I will provide a conservative estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, which is the same as the prior probability based on the city-wide statistics:

{probability: 0.15}
