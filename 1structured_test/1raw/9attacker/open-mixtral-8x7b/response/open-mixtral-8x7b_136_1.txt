Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

We are given that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Since the percentage in the neighborhood is higher than in the city as a whole, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker was more likely to be 185 cm or taller than if the neighborhood had the same distribution as the city.

However, since we don't have any information about the victim's height or any other relevant information, we can't make a more precise estimate. Therefore, we can only say that:

{probability: at least 0.2, but we can't give a more precise estimate without additional information}
