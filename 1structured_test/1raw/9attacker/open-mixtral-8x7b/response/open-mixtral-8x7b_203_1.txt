Without any other information, it might be tempting to use the percentage of people who are 185cm or taller in the city, which is 15%. However, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where a larger percentage of people are taller than 185cm, it would be more accurate to use this local information.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185cm or taller. Therefore, based on the information available, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
