Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, I will use the percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city (15%) as my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.15}
