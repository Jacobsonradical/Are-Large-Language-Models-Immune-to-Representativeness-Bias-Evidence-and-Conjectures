Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller).

However, the fact that the victim could not see the attacker's height introduces some uncertainty. It's possible that the attacker was actually taller than 185 cm, but it's also possible that they were shorter.

Given that we know that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, it seems reasonable to assume that the attacker was more likely to be in that category (since the victim couldn't see their height).

One way to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is to use a range of plausible values for the height of the attacker, and then calculate the proportion of those values that fall in the 185 cm or taller category.

For example, let's assume that the attacker could have been anywhere between 150 cm and 210 cm tall (a range that includes most adult heights). Under this assumption, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller would be:

(210-185)/(210-150) = 25/60 â‰ˆ 0.417

This is just one possible way to estimate the probability, and other assumptions about the attacker's height could lead to different estimates. However, based on the information provided, a reasonable estimate of the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller would be around 0.42.
