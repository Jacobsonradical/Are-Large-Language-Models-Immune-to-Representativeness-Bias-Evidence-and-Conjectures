Given that the attacker's height is unknown to the victim, the only information we can use to estimate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller comes from the population data of the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

The probability that a randomly chosen person from this neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20%.

Therefore,

{probability: 0.20, or 20%}
