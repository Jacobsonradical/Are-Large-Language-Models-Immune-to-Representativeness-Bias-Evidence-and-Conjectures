Without any other information, it might be tempting to use the percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15%. However, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where a larger percentage of people are 185 cm or taller (20%), it would be more accurate to use this higher percentage in our estimate.

Therefore, based on the information provided, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
