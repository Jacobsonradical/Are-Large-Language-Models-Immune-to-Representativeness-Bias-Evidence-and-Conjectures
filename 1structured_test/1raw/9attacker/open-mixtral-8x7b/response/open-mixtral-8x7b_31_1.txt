Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

We are given that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. The neighborhood figure is higher than the city figure, which might suggest a slightly increased chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, since these figures are relatively close, and since we have no other information to go on, it's reasonable to use the city-wide figure as our estimate.

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
