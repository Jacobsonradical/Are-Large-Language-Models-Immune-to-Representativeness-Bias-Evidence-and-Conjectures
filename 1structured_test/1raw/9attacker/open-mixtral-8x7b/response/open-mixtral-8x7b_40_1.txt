Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would change the distribution of heights in the population. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

{probability: 0.15}
