Without any other information, it's reasonable to use the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. This is because the attacker was in that neighborhood when the attack occurred.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
