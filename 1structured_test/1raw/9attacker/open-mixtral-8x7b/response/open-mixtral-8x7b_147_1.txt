Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. That is, about 15% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attacker could have been anyone in the city, and we have no reason to believe they were more likely to come from one part of the city than another, it seems reasonable to use this same probability when estimating the attacker's height.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
