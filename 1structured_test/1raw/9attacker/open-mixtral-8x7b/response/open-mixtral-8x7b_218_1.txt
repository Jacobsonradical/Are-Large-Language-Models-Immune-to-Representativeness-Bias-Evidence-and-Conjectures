Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood). However, the victim's inability to see the attacker's height could suggest that the attacker could be from anywhere in the city, not just the neighborhood.

Therefore, a more reasonable estimate might be the city-wide proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

So, my answer is:
{probability: 0.15}
