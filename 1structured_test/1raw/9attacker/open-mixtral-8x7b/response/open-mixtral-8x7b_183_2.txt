Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would change the probabilities determined by the population statistics. Therefore, even if the attack occurred in a neighborhood where taller people are more common, it does not change the overall probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on city-wide data.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
