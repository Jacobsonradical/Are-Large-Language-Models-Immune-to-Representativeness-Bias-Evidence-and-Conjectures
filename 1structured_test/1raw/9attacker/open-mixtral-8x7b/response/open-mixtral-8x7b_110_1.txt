Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the information about the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We know that 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, there's a 20% chance that the attacker was also 185 cm or taller. This is because, although the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, the fact that the attack happened in this particular neighborhood gives us some information about the attacker's height.

So, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
