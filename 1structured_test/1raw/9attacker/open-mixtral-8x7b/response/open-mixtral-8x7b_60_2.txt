Without any other information about the attacker, it is still possible to make an estimate based on the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This is called statistical or empirical Bayes estimation.

The probability that a randomly chosen person in this neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20%, so our prior estimate for the attacker's height is 0.2.

The answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
