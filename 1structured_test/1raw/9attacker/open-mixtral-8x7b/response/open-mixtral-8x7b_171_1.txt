Given that the attacker's height is unknown to the victim, the only relevant information is the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attacker was in the neighborhood, it is reasonable to base our estimate on the height distribution of the people in that neighborhood.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
