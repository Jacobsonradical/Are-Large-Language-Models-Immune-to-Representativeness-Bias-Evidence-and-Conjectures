Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood). However, the victim's inability to see the attacker's height changes the situation.

Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, the attacker's height doesn't depend on the neighborhood statistics but only on the city statistics. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%, the same as the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.15}
