Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood). However, the victim's inability to see the attacker's height provides some additional information.

Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, the attacker's height is not relevant to the victim's experience. In other words, the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller should be the same as the probability of any randomly chosen person in the neighborhood being that tall. Since 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this is also the probability that the attacker was that tall.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
