Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion in the neighborhood). However, the fact that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height introduces some uncertainty.

One way to approach this problem is to use a range of plausible values for the attacker's height, instead of a single value. Let's assume that the attacker's height could reasonably be anywhere between the shortest adult height and the tallest adult height. According to various sources, the average height for adult men worldwide is about 170 cm, and the tallest adult men in the world are typically over 200 cm. Of course, very few people are at the extremes of these ranges, and most people cluster around the average.

Given these assumptions, we can estimate that the attacker's height was probably somewhere between 160 cm and 210 cm, with a 95% probability (this is a rough estimate based on the normal distribution of heights). Using this range of plausible values, we can calculate the proportion of people in the neighborhood who fall into this range:

* 95% of people who are 185 cm or taller fall into the range of 160-210 cm (since 185 cm is within this range).
* According to the neighborhood statistics, 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm, so 20% are taller. Of these, 15% are between 160 cm and 185 cm (i.e., shorter than our plausible range), and 5% are taller than 210 cm (also outside our plausible range). Therefore, 95% of 20% of people in the neighborhood fall into the range of 160-210 cm.

Adding these two proportions together, we get a total of 97.5% of people in the neighborhood who fall into the plausible range of heights for the attacker. Of these, 15% are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15 / 0.975 â‰ˆ 0.153 or 15.3%}

This estimate is slightly higher than the 14.3% probability we would have gotten if we had simply used the 20% proportion of tall people in the neighborhood, but it takes into account the uncertainty around the attacker's height.
