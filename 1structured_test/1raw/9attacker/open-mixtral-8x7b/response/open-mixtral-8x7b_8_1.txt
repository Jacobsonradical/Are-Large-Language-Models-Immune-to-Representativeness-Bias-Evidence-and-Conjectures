Based on the information provided, even though the victim could not see the attacker's height, we can still make an estimate based on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

The attacker is at least as tall as the average height of people in that neighborhood, so we can use the percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller as a proxy for the likelihood that the attacker's height falls into this category.

We are given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
