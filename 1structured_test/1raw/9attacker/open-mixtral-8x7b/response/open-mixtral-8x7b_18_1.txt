Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and this neighborhood has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), it's plausible that the attacker was also in this taller category.

However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate and there are many other factors that could influence the attacker's height. For example, the time of the attack could be correlated with certain demographic groups being more active.

That being said, based on the given information, I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.05 = 0.20, explaining that this is a rough estimate based on the assumption that the neighborhood has a similar distribution of heights as the city, but with an additional 5% margin for the higher proportion of tall people in the neighborhood}
