Without any other information about the attacker, it is still possible to make an estimate based on the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

According to the information given, 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, it is reasonable to estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
