Given that the attack occurred from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we cannot determine the attacker's height based on the information provided about the population. However, using the statistical data for the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
