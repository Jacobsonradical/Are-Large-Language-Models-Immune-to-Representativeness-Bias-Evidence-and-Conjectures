If we don't have any other information about the attacker, we can make an estimate based on the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. According to that distribution, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
