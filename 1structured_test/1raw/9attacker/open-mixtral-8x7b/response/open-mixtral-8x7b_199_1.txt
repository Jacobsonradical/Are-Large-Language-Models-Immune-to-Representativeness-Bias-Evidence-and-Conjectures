Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and this neighborhood has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), it's plausible that the attacker was also in this taller category. However, it's important to note that the victim couldn't see the attacker, so this is all speculative.

Given the information, and assuming the distributions are similar, I would estimate a slightly higher probability for the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller in this neighborhood:

{probability: 0.18 or 18%}

This is a rough estimate and the actual probability could be different, especially if there are factors not included in the information provided that could influence the attacker's height.
