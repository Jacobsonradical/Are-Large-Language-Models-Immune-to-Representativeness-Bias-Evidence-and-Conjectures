If we assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole, then we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

Since 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, that means that 20% are 185 cm or taller. Because we have no reason to believe that the attacker was more or less likely to be a certain height than any other person in the neighborhood, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as simply the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that height or taller.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
