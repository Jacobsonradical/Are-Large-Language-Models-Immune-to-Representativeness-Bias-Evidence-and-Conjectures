Given that the attacker's height is unknown to the victim, the only relevant information is the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attacker was likely chosen at random from the local population, we can use the height distribution in the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We are given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
