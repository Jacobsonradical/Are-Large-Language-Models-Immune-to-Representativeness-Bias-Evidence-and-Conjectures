Given that the attacker's height is unknown to the victim, the only relevant information is the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attacker was in this neighborhood, it is more logical to use this distribution to estimate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
