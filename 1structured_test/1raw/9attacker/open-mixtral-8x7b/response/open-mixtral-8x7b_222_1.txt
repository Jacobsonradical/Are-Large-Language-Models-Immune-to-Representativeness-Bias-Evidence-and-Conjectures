Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to the distribution of heights in the city as a whole. This is a common assumption made in forensic contexts, called the "source population principle."

Given this assumption, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

* We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.
* We assume that the same percentage of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller.
* Since 20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller, this is our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

So, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
