Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

We are given that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Since the percentage in the neighborhood is higher, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker was more likely to be 185 cm or taller than the city average.

However, since the victim could not see the attacker, we have no information about the attacker's height other than the general population statistics. Therefore, based solely on this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is still 15%.
