Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we cannot determine the exact height of the attacker. However, using the given information about the heights of people in the city and the neighborhood, we can make an estimate.

The attack happened in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Although we don't know the exact height of the attacker, we can estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the population of the neighborhood.
