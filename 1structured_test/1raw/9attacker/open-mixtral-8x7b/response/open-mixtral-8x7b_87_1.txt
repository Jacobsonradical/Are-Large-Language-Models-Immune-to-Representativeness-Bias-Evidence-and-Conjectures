Given that the population statistics of the city and the neighborhood are different, we cannot directly use the population statistics to estimate the attacker's height. However, since the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher ratio of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%), it suggests that there is a higher probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability, let's consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: The attacker is chosen randomly from the city's population.
Scenario 2: The attacker is chosen randomly from the neighborhood's population.

In Scenario 1, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 15% (since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller). In Scenario 2, the probability is 20% (since 20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller).

Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, Scenario 2 is more likely. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
