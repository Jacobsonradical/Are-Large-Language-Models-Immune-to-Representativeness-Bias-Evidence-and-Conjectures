Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%. However, this would be an estimate based on the neighborhood's population, not the city's population, which is the relevant population since people from all over the city could potentially be in that neighborhood at night.

Given that the attacker could be from anywhere in the city, it is more appropriate to use the city's population statistics. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 15%.

{probability: 0.15}
