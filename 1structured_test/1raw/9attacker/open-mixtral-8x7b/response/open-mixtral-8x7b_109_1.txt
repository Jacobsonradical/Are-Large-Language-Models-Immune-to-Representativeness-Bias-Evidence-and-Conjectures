Without any other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. This is because the attacker was in this neighborhood at the time of the attack.

So, based on the information that 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller:

{probability: 0.2, because 20% is equal to 0.2 when expressed as a decimal}
