Without any other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the population statistics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred to estimate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. This is because the attacker was in that neighborhood at the time of the attack. 

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
