Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood). However, the victim's inability to see the attacker's height changes the situation.

Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, the attacker's height doesn't depend on the neighborhood distribution anymore. The attacker's height is either 185 cm or taller or it's not. The victim's experience doesn't give us any information about the attacker's height other than the fact that it was tall enough to attack from behind without being seen.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as in the city: 15%.

{probability: 0.15}
