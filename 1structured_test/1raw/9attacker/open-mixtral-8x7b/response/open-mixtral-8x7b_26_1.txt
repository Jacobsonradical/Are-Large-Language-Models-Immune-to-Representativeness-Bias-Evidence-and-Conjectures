Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller and the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller people (20%), it is reasonable to increase our estimate of the attacker's height to be 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.18 (or 18%)}

Explanation: While we don't have specific information about the attacker, we can make an educated guess based on the population data available for the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the neighborhood has a higher proportion of taller people, it increases the likelihood that the attacker was also tall. However, it's essential to note that this is an estimation and not a definitive conclusion.
