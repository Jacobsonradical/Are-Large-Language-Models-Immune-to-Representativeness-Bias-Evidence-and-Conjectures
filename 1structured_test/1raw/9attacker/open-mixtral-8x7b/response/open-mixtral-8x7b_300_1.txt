Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would change the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. The attacker's height is still subject to the same population statistics as before the attack. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
