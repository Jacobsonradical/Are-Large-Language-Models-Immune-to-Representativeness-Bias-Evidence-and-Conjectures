Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), it's reasonable to assume that the attacker was also more likely to be 185 cm or taller.

However, it's important to note that this is still just an estimate, and there are many factors that could affect the true probability of the attacker's height. For example, if the victim was tall themselves, they may be more likely to be attacked by someone who is also tall. Or if the attacker specifically targeted the victim because of their height, this could also affect the probability.

That being said, based on the information provided and assuming a similar distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.2, or 20%}
