Without any further information about the attacker, we have no choice but to base our estimate on the general population of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the police investigation has given us this information, we will assume it is relevant to the attacker's height.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
