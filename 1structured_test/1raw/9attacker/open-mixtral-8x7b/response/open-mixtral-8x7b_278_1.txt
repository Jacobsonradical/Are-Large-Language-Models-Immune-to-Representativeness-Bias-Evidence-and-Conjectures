Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and this neighborhood has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), it's possible that the attacker was even more likely to be 185 cm or taller than these percentages suggest.

However, since the problem statement specifies that the victim could not see the attacker's height, we must rely solely on the population data to make an estimate. Given that 20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

{probability: 0.2, the attacker has a 20% chance of being 185 cm or taller}
