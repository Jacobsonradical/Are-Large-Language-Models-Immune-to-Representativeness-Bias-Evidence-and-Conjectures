Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), we can use the higher percentage to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}
