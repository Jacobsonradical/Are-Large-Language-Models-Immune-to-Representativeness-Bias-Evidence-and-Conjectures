Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion in the neighborhood). However, the key piece of information is that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height. This means that the attacker's height doesn't depend on the neighborhood distribution, but rather on the city distribution.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%, which is the same as the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller.
