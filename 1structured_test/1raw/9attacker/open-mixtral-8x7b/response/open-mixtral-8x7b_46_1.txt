Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city (15%) as our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

However, since we know that the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a slightly higher percentage of tall people (20%), we might adjust our estimate upward slightly. Taking this into account, a reasonable estimate might be 17% or 18%.

So, my final answer is:

{probability: 0.17 (or 17%)} or
{probability: 0.18 (or 18%)}

depending on how much we want to adjust our estimate based on the slightly higher prevalence of tall people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.
