Given that the victim could not see the attacker's height, we cannot determine the exact height of the attacker. However, based on the information about the heights of people in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we can make an estimate about the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We are given that in the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Since we don't have any information that suggests that the attacker is not a typical resident of the city, it is reasonable to assume that the attacker's height follows a similar distribution. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 15%.

However, since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, we might want to update our estimate based on this new information. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the attack occurred in the neighborhood. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We are given that P(B|A) = 1, since if the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, then the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. We are also given that P(A) = 0.15, as we calculated earlier. Finally, we are given that P(B) is the probability that a random attack in the city occurs in this neighborhood. We don't have information about this probability, but since the neighborhood is not unusual in any way, we can assume that it is not very different from the overall proportion of attacks in the city. As a rough estimate, let's assume that P(B) is around 0.1 (i.e., 10% of all attacks in the city occur in this neighborhood).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= (1) \* (0.15) / (0.1)
= 1.5

This result doesn't make sense, since a probability should always be a number between 0 and 1. The problem is that our estimate for P(B) is too low. Since we don't have any information about the actual value of P(B), let's try assuming a higher value, such as P(B) = 0.5 (i.e., 50% of all attacks in the city occur in this neighborhood). With this assumption, we have

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= (1) \* (0.15) / (0.5)
= 0.3

This estimate suggests that, given the information we have, there is a 30% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. This is higher than our initial estimate of 15%, which is not surprising since the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of tall people.
