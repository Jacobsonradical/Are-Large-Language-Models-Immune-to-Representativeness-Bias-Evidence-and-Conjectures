If we assume that the distribution of heights in the city is similar to that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, then we can use the information about the neighborhood to make an estimate.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, and assuming this is also true for the attacker, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
