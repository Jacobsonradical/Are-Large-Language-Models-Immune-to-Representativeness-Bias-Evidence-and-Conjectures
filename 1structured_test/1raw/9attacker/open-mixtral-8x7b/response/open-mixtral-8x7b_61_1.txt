Without any other information, it is reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the percentages given for the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20% or 0.2 (since 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller).

{probability: 0.2}
