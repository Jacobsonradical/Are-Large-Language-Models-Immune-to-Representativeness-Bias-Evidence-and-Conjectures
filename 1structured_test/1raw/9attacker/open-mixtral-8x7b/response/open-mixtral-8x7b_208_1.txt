Given that the attack occurred from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, the only information we have to base our estimate on is the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

We are given that 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on the available information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
