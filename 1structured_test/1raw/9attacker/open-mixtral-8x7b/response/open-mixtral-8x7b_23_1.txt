Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller, we can use this as our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
