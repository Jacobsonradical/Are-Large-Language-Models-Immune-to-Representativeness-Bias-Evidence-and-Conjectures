Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, this means that the remaining 20% are 185 cm or taller. Even though the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, the population data from the neighborhood can still be used to make an estimate. This is because the attacker is part of this population and therefore shares the same height distribution as the rest of the people in the neighborhood.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
