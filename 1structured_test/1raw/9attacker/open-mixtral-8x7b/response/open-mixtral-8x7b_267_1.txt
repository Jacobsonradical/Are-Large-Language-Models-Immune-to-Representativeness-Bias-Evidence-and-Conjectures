Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the information about the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We know that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, there's a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
