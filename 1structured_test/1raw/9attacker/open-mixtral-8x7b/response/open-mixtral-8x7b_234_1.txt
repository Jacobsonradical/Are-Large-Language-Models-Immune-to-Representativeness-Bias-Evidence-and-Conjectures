Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and this neighborhood has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), we would expect that the attacker is even more likely to be tall than 15%. However, since the victim couldn't see the attacker, we have no direct evidence to support this assumption.

Given the information provided, we can't definitively estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. But we can use the 20% figure from the neighborhood as a rough upper bound, since it suggests a higher prevalence of tall people.

{probability: 0.2 or higher, but we don't have enough information to provide a more precise estimate}
