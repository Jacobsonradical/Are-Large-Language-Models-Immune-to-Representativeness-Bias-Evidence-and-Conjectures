Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

We are given that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This second percentage is higher than the first, which might lead us to suspect that the attacker was more likely to be 185 cm or taller.

However, the victim could not see the attacker's height. This means that the attacker's height does not influence the probability we are asked to estimate. The victim's inability to see the attacker's height means that the attacker's height is not a factor in this problem.

Therefore, even though the percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller is higher in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we have no reason to believe that the attacker was more likely to be 185 cm or taller.

So, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
