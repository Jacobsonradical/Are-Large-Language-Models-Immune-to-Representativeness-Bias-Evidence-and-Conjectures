Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and in the neighborhood, this increases slightly to 20%. 

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20% or:

{probability: 0.2}
