Based on the information provided, even though the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can still make an estimate based on the population distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in this neighborhood is 20%. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
