Given that the attack occurred from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, the only information we can use to estimate the attacker's height comes from the general population data of the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

We are given that 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on this information, we can estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

So, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
