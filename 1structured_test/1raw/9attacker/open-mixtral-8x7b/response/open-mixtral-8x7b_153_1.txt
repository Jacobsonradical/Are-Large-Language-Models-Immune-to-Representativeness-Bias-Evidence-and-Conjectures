Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the given percentages to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2, explanation: This is based on the information that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.}
