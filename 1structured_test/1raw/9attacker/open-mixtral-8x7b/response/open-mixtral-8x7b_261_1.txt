Without any other information, it is reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

Therefore, we can use the percentages given for the city to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. 

This gives us:

{probability: 0.15}
