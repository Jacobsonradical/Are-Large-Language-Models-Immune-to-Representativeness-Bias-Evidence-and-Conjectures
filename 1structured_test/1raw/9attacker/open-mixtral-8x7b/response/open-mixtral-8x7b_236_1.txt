Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), it's plausible that the attacker was also in this taller category.

However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate, and there are many factors that could affect the true probability of the attacker's height. For example, if the victim was in a part of the neighborhood where taller people are more common (e.g., near a basketball court), then the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller could be higher. On the other hand, if the victim was in a part of the neighborhood where shorter people are more common (e.g., near a school), then the probability could be lower.

Taking all of this into account, I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

{probability: 0.18, based on the higher proportion of tall people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred}
