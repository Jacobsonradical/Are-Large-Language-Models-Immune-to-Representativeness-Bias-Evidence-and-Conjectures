Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the information about the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We know that 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, there's a 20% chance that a randomly selected person in the neighborhood would be 185 cm or taller. Since we have no reason to believe that the attacker is any more or less likely to be a certain height than a randomly selected person in the neighborhood, it's reasonable to use this percentage as our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
