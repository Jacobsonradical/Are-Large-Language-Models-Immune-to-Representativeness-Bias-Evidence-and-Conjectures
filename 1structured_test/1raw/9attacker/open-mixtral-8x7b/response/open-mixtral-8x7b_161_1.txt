Without more specific information about the population in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we cannot precisely determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, since we know that the neighborhood has an even higher percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the overall city population (15%), we can say that there is a greater chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Given this information, we can estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: at least 0.2, but potentially higher than 0.2 depending on the actual population distribution in the neighborhood}
