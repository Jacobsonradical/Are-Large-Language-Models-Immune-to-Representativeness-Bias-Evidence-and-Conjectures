Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would contradict the height distribution of the general population in the city. Since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where taller people are even less common (only 20% instead of 15% city-wide), it is less likely that the attacker was unusually tall. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller should be closer to the city-wide percentage.

{probability: 0.15}
