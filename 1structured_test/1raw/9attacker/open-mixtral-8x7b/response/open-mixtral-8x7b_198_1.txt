Based on the information provided, even though the victim could not see the attacker's height, we can use the population data to make an estimate. 

The attack could have happened to anyone in the city, and we know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. However, the police investigation has given us additional information that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This neighborhood-specific data suggests a higher probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

To estimate this, we can use the principle of indifference, which states that if we have no reason to favor one possibility over another, we should assign them all equal probability. In this case, we can assume that the attacker was randomly selected from the local population, and therefore, we can apply the 20% figure.

{probability: 0.2}
