Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as in the neighborhood). However, this would be an error in probabilistic reasoning known as the prosecutor's fallacy. The relevant probability is not the probability of the suspect's height given the population of the neighborhood, but the probability of the victim being attacked by someone 185 cm or taller given the height distribution in the population that could have potentially attacked the victim.

Since the victim couldn't see the attacker, we can only use the height distribution of the population as a whole, not the neighborhood specifically, to make our estimate. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 15%, which is the same as the overall proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller.
