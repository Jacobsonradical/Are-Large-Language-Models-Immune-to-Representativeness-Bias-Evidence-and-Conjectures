Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the proportions given in the problem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Given that the attacker was chosen at random from the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

{probability: 0.2, explanation: This is the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, according to the given information.}
