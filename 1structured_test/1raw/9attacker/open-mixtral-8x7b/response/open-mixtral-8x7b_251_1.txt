Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and this neighborhood has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), it's plausible that the attacker was also in this taller group. However, since the victim couldn't see the attacker, we can't rule out the possibility that the attacker was shorter.

Given that the neighborhood has a higher proportion of tall people, I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be slightly higher than 15%, but without more specific data about the neighborhood, it's difficult to provide an exact number. I would estimate this probability to be around 18% - 20%.

{probability: 0.18 - 0.20}
