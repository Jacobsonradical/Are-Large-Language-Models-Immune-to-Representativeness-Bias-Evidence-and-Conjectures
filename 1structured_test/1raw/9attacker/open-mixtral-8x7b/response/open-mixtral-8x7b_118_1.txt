Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would change the distribution of heights in the attacker population. The population height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is less relevant, since the victim could not have observed this.

Therefore, based on the information that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller in the city where the attack occurred, we estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
