Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood). However, the victim's inability to see the attacker's height could introduce additional uncertainty.

If we assume that the victim's inability to see the attacker's height means that the attacker's height is essentially a random draw from the neighborhood population, then we might want to use the total proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller as our estimate. That is, the attacker's height is equally likely to be any height in the neighborhood population.

In this case, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

(number of people who are 185 cm or taller) / (total neighborhood population)
= (0.20) / (0.20 + 0.80)
= 0.20 / 1.00
= 0.20

So, in this scenario, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be 0.20.
