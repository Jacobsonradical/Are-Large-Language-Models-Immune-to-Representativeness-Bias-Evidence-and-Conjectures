Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the given percentages to make an estimate.

The victim could not see the attacker's height, so we have no reason to favor one height category over the other. Thus, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be the same as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
