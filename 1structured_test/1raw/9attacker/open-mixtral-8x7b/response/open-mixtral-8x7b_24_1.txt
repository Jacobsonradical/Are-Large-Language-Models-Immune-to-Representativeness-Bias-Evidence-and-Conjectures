Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that tall). However, the fact that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height introduces some uncertainty.

One way to approach this problem is to use a concept from probability theory called "maximum entropy." This approach assumes that we know as little as possible about the attacker's height, given the information we have. In other words, we should assume that all heights are equally likely, unless we have a good reason to think otherwise.

Under this assumption, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows:

* We know that 80% of the population in the neighborhood is shorter than 185 cm, so there is a 80% chance that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* This means that there is a 100% - 80% = 20% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

So, based on the maximum entropy principle, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
