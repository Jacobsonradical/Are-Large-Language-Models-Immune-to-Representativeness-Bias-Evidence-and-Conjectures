Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, and assuming this neighborhood is representative of the city, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

{probability: 0.2}
