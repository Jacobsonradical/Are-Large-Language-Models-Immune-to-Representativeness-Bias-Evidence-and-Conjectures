Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

We are given that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Since the percentage in the neighborhood is higher than in the city as a whole, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker was more likely to be 185 cm or taller than if the neighborhood had the same distribution as the city.

However, without any other information, we can't make a more precise estimate. Therefore, we can only provide a range of probabilities. The minimum probability is 0.15, which is the overall city average. The maximum probability is 0.20, which is the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: between 0.15 and 0.20}
