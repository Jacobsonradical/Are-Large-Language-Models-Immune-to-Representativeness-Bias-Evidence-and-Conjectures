Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood). However, the victim's inability to see the attacker's height actually provides some information that should be taken into account.

Given that the attack occurred at night and the victim could not see the attacker's height, it seems less likely that the attacker was particularly tall. If the attacker was significantly taller than most people, it seems more likely that the victim would have been able to notice this fact, even in the dark. Therefore, it seems reasonable to adjust our estimate of the probability based on this information.

One way to approach this problem is to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, and our new evidence is that the victim could not see the attacker's height.

Let's assume that if the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there is a 50% chance that the victim would have been able to see their height (this is just a rough estimate, and the true probability could be different). On the other hand, if the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, let's assume that there is only a 10% chance that the victim would have been able to see their height (again, this is just a rough estimate).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the victim could not see their height. The calculation is as follows:

P(185 cm | cannot see height) = P(cannot see height | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(cannot see height)

We are given that P(185 cm) = 0.2 (20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller), and we are assuming that P(cannot see height | 185 cm) = 0.5 (there is a 50% chance that the victim would not be able to see the attacker's height if they were 185 cm or taller) and P(cannot see height | not 185 cm) = 0.9 (there is a 90% chance that the victim would not be able to see the attacker's height if they were shorter than 185 cm).

To calculate P(cannot see height), we can use the law of total probability:

P(cannot see height) = P(cannot see height | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) + P(cannot see height | not 185 cm) * P(not 185 cm)

Plugging in our values, we get:

P(cannot see height) = (0.5 * 0.2) + (0.9 * 0.8) = 0.5 + 0.72 = 1.22

This value is greater than 1, which suggests that our assumptions may be incorrect or incomplete. However, we can still use Bayes' theorem to calculate a rough estimate of the posterior probability. We get:

P(185 cm | cannot see height) = (0.5 * 0.2) / 1.22 = 0.1065

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 10.65%. This is lower than our prior belief of 20%, reflecting the fact that the victim's inability to see the attacker's height makes it less likely that they were particularly tall.
