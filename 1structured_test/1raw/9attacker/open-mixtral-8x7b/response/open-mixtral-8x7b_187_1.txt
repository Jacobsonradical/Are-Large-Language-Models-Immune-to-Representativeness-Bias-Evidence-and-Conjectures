Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller).

However, the fact that the victim could not see the attacker's height might suggest that the attacker was not chosen at random from the general population, but rather from the subset of people who could approach the victim from behind undetected.

If we assume that this subset of people is representative of the neighborhood population rather than the city population, then it would be more appropriate to use the neighborhood statistics to estimate the probability. In this case, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be 20%.

However, without further information, we cannot be certain that the subset of people who could approach the victim from behind is representative of the neighborhood population. Therefore, a more conservative estimate might be to split the difference between the city and neighborhood statistics, which would give a probability of 17.25% (i.e., 85% of the city population plus 20% of the difference between the city and neighborhood populations).

So, in summary, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 17.25%}
