Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would allow us to update our prior beliefs about the attacker's height based on the victim's observations. Therefore, we must rely on the population statistics provided for the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

According to the police investigation, 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
