Without any other information, it is reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the percentages given for the city to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is therefore:

{probability: 0.15}

This is because 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, and we are assuming that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar.
