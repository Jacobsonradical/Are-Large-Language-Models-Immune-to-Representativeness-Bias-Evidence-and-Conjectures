Without any further information about the attacker, it is still possible to make an estimate based on the given data about the heights of people in the city and the neighborhood.

Since 80% of the neighborhood's population is shorter than 185 cm, it means that 20% or 1 in 5 residents are 185 cm or taller. Given that the attack could have been committed by anyone in the neighborhood, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller would be the same as the rate at which this characteristic appears in the neighborhood's population.

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
