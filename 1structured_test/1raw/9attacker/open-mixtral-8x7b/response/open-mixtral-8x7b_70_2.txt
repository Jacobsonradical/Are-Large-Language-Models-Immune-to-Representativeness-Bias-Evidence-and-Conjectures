Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller).

However, the fact that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height might suggest that the attacker was likely tall enough to attack from behind without being seen. In other words, the attacker might have been taller than the average person in the population.

Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and this is already above the average height, we might estimate that the attacker was even more likely to be in this taller category.

On the other hand, we don't have any information that suggests that the attacker was specifically chosen from the tallest 20% of the neighborhood. So it's possible that the attacker's height was not related to their tallness relative to the neighborhood, but rather their tallness relative to the victim.

Taking all of this into account, a reasonable estimate might be that the attacker was more likely than average to be 185 cm or taller, but perhaps not as high as 20%. A probability of 0.15 to 0.20 might be a reasonable range.

So my estimate is:

{probability: 0.175, with a range of 0.15 to 0.20}
