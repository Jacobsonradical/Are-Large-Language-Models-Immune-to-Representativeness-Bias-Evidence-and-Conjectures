If we don't have any other information about the attacker, the best estimate for their height would come from the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. This is because the attacker is likely to be a person from this neighborhood.

Given that 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
