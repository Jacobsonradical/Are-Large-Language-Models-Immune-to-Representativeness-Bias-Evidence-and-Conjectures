Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would contradict the height of a typical attacker being similar to the general population's heights. 

Since the attacker is no more or less likely to be tall than the general population, we can use the probability of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
