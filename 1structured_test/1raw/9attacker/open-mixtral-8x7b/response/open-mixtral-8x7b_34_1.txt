Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, the attacker's height is independent of the population distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller remains the same as in the city's overall population, which is 15%.

{probability: 0.15}
