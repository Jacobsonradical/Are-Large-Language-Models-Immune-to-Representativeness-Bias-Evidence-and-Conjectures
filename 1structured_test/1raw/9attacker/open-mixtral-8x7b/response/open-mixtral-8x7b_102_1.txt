Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, it means that 20% are 185 cm or taller. Even though the victim could not see the attacker's height, the population data from the neighborhood can still be useful in making an estimate. This is based on the assumption that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood is similar to the distribution of heights in the city.

The probability that a random person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20%, which is the same as 0.20 in decimal form. Therefore, given the information we have, it's reasonable to estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is also 0.20.
