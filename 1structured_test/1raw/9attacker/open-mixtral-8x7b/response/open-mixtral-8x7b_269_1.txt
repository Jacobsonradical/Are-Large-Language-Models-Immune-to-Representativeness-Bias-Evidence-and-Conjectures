Without any further information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred to estimate the probability of the attacker's height. This is because the attacker is likely to be a resident or frequent visitor of that neighborhood.

Based on the given information, the probability that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20%.

So, the answer to the question is:

{probability: 0.2, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%}.
