Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city (15%) as our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

However, since the attacker was in the taller 15% of the city's population, and the neighborhood where the attack occurred has an even higher percentage of tall people (20%), it's possible that the attacker was more likely to be 185 cm or taller than our initial estimate suggests.

Taking this into account, we can revise our estimate based on the neighborhood's height distribution. We want to know the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, given that they are in the taller half of the neighborhood's population. Since 20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller, and we're only considering the taller half, our revised estimate is 20% / 50% = 0.4, or 40%.

So, based on the information provided, I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be:

{probability: 0.4}
