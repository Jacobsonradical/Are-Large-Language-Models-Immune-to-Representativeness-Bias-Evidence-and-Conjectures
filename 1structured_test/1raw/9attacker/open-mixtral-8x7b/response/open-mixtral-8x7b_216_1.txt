Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that tall). However, the fact that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height might suggest that the attacker was likely to be taller than average (since being able to attack someone from behind without being seen might be easier if you're taller).

Assuming that the attacker was chosen at random from the local population, we can estimate the probability of them being 185 cm or taller as follows:

* We know that 80% of the local population is shorter than 185 cm, and 20% is 185 cm or taller.
* Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we might assume that the attacker was more likely to be taller than average. For example, we might assume that the attacker was in the top 50th percentile of heights (i.e., taller than 50% of the population).
* To find the probability of being in the top 50th percentile and being 185 cm or taller, we can look at the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of heights in the local population. Since 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this means that the CDF at 185 cm is 0.2. To find the probability of being in the top 50th percentile and being 185 cm or taller, we need to find the height such that the CDF is 0.5, and then see what proportion of the population is 185 cm or taller at that height.
* Using linear interpolation, we can estimate that the height with a CDF of 0.5 is approximately 188 cm. At this height, the CDF is still only 0.2 (since only 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller), so we need to look at taller heights to find the probability of being in the top 50th percentile and being 185 cm or taller.
* The next height with a CDF of 0.5 is approximately 191 cm, at which point the CDF is 0.4 (since 40% of the population is 185 cm or taller). This means that the probability of being in the top 50th percentile and being 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (the difference between the CDF at 191 cm and the CDF at 185 cm).

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
