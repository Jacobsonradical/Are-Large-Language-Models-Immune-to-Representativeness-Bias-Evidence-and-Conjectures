Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the information about the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We know that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, which is higher than the 15% for the city as a whole. However, since the victim could not see the attacker's height, it's possible that the attacker was from outside the neighborhood and therefore more likely to be of average city height (15% or taller).

Given that the attacker could have come from anywhere in the city, it seems reasonable to use the city-wide distribution of heights as a baseline for our estimate. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}

However, since the attacker came from the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, there might be a slightly higher chance that the attacker was also 185 cm or taller. But without further information, it's difficult to make a more precise estimate.
