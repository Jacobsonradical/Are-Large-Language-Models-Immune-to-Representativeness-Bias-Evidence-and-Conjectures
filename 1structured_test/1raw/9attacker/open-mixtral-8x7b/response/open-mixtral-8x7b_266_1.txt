Without any further information about the attacker, the best we can do is use the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. We don't have specific information about the victim and the attacker that would allow us to make a more informed estimate.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
