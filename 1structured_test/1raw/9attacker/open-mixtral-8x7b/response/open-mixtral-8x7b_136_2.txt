Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the information about the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We know that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Since the attacker was not identified, we don't know if they were chosen randomly from the population or if there is some other factor that might affect their height. However, without any reason to assume otherwise, it's reasonable to use the population distribution as a proxy for the distribution of attackers.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
