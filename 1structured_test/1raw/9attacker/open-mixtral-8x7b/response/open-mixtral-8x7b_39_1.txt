Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

Therefore, we can use the percentages provided for the city to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. 

This gives us a probability of 15% since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. 

However, since the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and this is higher than the city-wide percentage, our estimate should be at least as high as 20%. 

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2 or higher}
