Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would suggest the attacker's height does not reflect the general population's height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

Therefore, we can use the height distribution of the neighborhood's population to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
