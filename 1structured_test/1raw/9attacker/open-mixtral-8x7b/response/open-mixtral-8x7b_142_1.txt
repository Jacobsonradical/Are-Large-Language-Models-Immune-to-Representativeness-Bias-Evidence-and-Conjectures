Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the proportions given in the problem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We are given that 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, which suggests that there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height falls into this category.
