Based on the information provided, the attacker's height is more likely to be 185 cm or taller than if we only considered the city's population proportions. This is because the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of tall people (20%) compared to the city as a whole (15%).

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the height distribution in the neighborhood where the crime occurred. We are told that 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
