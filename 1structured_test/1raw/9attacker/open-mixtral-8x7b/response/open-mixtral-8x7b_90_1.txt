Given that the population statistics of the city and the neighborhood are different, we cannot directly use the population statistics to estimate the attacker's height. However, since the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher ratio of tall people (185 cm or taller) compared to the city's population (20% vs 15%), it suggests that there is a higher probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

To provide a numerical estimate, let's consider the following:

1. The victim could not see the attacker's height, so any information about the attacker's height must come from other sources.
2. The only height-related information given is the proportion of people in the city and the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.
3. Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, we should use the neighborhood's statistics for our estimate.
4. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%.
