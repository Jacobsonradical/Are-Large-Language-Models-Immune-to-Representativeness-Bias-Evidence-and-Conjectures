Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, the only information we have to estimate the attacker's height comes from the population data of the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

We are given that 20% of the population in this neighborhood is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
