Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion in the neighborhood). However, the key piece of information is that the attack happened at night and the victim couldn't see the attacker's height. This means that the height of the attacker is unrelated to the population distribution of heights in the neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the probability of a randomly chosen person from the city being 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
