Without any other information, it is reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the percentages given for the city to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We are given that 15% of the people in the city are 185 cm or taller. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we can estimate that the same percentage of people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore:

{probability: 0.15}
