Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the given statistics to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We are given that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Since the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of tall people (20%), it's plausible to assume that the attacker was also more likely to be tall.

However, it's important to note that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, so any estimate we make will be based on the population statistics alone. Given that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and the neighborhood where the attack occurred has an even higher proportion (20%), a conservative estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be 15%.

So, the answer is:

{probability: 0.15}
