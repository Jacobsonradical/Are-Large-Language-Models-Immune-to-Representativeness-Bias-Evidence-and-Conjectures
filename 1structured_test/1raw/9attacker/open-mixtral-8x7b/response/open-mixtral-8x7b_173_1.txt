Without any other information about the attacker, it is still possible to make an estimate based on the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, this is our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
