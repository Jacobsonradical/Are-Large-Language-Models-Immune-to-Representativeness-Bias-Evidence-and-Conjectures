Given that the attack occurred from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, the only information we have to estimate the attacker's height comes from the population data of the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

We are given that in this neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
