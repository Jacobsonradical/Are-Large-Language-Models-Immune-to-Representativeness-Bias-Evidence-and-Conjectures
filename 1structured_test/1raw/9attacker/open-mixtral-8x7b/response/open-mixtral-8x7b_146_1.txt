Without any other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the population data from the neighborhood as our best estimate of the attacker's height. We don't have any reason to believe that the attacker's height is related to where the attack occurred, only that they are part of that local population.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
