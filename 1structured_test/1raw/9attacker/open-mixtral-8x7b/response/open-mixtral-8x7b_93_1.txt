Without any further information about the attacker, it is still possible to make an estimate based on the given data about the heights of people in the city and the neighborhood.

Since 80% of the neighborhood's population is shorter than 185 cm and the attacker came from that neighborhood, it is plausible to use the neighborhood's statistics for this estimation. Therefore, the attacker would have a 20% chance of being 185 cm or taller:

{probability: 0.20}
