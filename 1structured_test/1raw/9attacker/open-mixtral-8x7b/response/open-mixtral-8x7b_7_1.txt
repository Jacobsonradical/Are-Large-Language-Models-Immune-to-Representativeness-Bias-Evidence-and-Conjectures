Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, the only information we have to estimate the attacker's height is the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. We don't have any reason to believe that the attacker was from outside this neighborhood, so we can use the local population distribution as a reasonable estimate.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
