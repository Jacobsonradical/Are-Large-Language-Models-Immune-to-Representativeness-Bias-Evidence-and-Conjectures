Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller and the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of taller people (20%), it is reasonable to increase the estimate of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. 

However, without additional information about the victim's height or the attacker's build, it is difficult to provide a precise probability. Considering the provided data, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.2, explanation: Based on the neighborhood's demographic information, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, which is the highest available data point.}
