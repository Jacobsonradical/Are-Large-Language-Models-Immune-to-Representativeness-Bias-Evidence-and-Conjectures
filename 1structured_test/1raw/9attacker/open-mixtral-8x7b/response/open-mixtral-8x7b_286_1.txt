Without any further information about the attacker, we have no choice but to base our estimate on the population statistics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the police investigation has discovered that 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, this is our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
