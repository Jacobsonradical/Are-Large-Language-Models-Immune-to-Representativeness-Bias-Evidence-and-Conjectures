Given that the attack occurred from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would contradict the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the height distribution of the attacker would align with the distribution of the neighborhood.

Based on the information provided, 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Thus, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.2}
