Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the given statistics to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

The probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 15%. Since the distribution of heights in the neighborhood is similar to that of the city, we can estimate that the probability that a person chosen at random from the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is also 15%.

However, the attacker was likely to be a resident of the neighborhood where the attack occurred, so we should adjust our estimate to take into account the fact that a larger proportion of people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm. Specifically, we should adjust our estimate downward by the same proportion as the difference in the distributions of heights between the neighborhood and the city as a whole.

The proportion of people in the neighborhood who are shorter than 185 cm is 80%, compared to 85% in the city as a whole. This represents a difference of 5 percentage points. Therefore, we should adjust our initial estimate of 15% downward by 5 percentage points, to 10%.

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.10}
