Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, I will use the information about the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, I estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
