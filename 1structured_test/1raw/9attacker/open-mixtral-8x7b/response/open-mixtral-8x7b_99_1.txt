Without any other information, it might be tempting to use the percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15%. However, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, we should use this more specific information.

Therefore, based on the information that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.2}
