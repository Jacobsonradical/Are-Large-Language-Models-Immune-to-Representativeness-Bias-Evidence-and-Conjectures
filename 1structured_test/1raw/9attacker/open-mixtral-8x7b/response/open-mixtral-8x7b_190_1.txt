Without any further information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. This is because the attacker is likely to be from this neighborhood.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
