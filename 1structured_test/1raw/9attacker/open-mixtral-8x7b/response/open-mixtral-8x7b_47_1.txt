If we don't have any other information about the attacker, the best estimate for the attacker's height would come from the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

Given that 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
