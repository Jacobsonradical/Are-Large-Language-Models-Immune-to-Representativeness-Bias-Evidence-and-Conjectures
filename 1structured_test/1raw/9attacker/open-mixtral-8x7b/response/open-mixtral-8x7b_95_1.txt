Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

The attacker could be any height, but since the victim couldn't see the attacker, we have no reason to believe the attacker's height is any more or less likely to be 185 cm or taller than the general population. 

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be the same as the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, which we know is 15% or 0.15. 

However, since the problem states that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, we might adjust our estimate based on this new information. But without any information about how representative the neighborhood is of the city as a whole, it's hard to make a definitive estimate. 

But based on the neighborhood data alone, the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2. 

So, strictly in the format you requested:

{probability: 0.2}
