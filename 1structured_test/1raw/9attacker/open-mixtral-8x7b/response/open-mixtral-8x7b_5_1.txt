Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller). However, the fact that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height might suggest that the attacker was likely to be taller than average, since being able to attack someone from behind without being seen might be easier for a taller person.

Assuming that the attacker was chosen at random from the neighborhood population, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as follows:

* We know that 20% of the neighborhood population is 185 cm or taller.
* However, we also know that being taller might make it easier to attack someone from behind without being seen. Let's assume that this gives an advantage to taller people, and that the probability of a taller person attacking someone from behind is proportionally higher than their representation in the population.
* Specifically, let's assume that the probability of a taller person attacking someone from behind is proportional to their height. This is a somewhat arbitrary assumption, but it seems reasonable: a person who is 10 cm taller than another person might have a 10% higher probability of attacking from behind, and so on.
* Under this assumption, the probability of a person who is 185 cm or taller attacking someone from behind would be proportional to their height relative to the average height. In the population as a whole, the average height is 176.7 cm for men and 163.5 cm for women (source: World Population Review), so let's take the average of these two numbers, which is 170 cm.
* The ratio of the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller to the average height is therefore at least 185/170 = 1.09 (rounded to one decimal place).
* Therefore, we can estimate the probability of a person who is 185 cm or taller attacking someone from behind as being 1.09 times higher than their representation in the population.
* This gives us an estimated probability of 20% \* 1.09 = 21.8%, or roughly 22%.

So, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.22}
