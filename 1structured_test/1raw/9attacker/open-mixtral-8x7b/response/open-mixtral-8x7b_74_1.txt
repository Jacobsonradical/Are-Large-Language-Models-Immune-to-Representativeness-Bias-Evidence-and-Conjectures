Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that tall). However, the fact that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height introduces some uncertainty.

Given that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, it seems reasonable to assume that the attacker could have been anyone in the population, not just people in the neighborhood. Therefore, a more conservative estimate of the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller would be the overall proportion of people in the city who are that tall, which is 15%.

{probability: 0.15}
