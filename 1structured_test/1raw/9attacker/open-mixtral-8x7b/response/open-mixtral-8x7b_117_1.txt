Without any further information about the attacker, we have no reason to diverge from the population statistics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Therefore, the best estimate for the height of the attacker would be based on the distribution of heights in that neighborhood.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
