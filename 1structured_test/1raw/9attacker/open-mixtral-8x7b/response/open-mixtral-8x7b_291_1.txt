Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

We are given that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. 

Given that the attacker was chosen at random from the neighborhood where the attack occurred, and that the distribution of heights in this neighborhood is at least as favorable to the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as it is in the city as a whole, it seems reasonable to estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is at least as great as 15%.

However, since we know that the neighborhood has an even higher proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller, it's appropriate to use the neighborhood proportion instead. 

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
