Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the information about the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We know that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, and since the victim could not see the attacker's height, it's reasonable to assume that the attacker was randomly selected from the neighborhood population.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%.

Answer: {probability: 0.2}
