Based on the information provided, even though the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can still make an estimate based on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

The attacker is at least as tall as the 20th percentile of people in that neighborhood, so the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is at least as high as the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are also 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

So, {probability: 0.2}.
