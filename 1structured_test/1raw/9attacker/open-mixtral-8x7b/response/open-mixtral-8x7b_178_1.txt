Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as in the neighborhood). However, this might not be accurate because the population distribution in the city is different from the neighborhood.

Unfortunately, without knowing the exact height distribution of the attacker population, we cannot give a precise probability. However, here is some reasoning that might help:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, this percentage is 80%. This means that the neighborhood has a higher proportion of tall people.

2. If the attacker was chosen at random from the city's population, the probability of them being 185 cm or taller would be 15%. But since the attack occurred in a neighborhood with a higher proportion of tall people, it seems plausible that the attacker was more likely to be tall than the city average.

3. However, we cannot quantify this increase in probability without more information.

Therefore, we cannot provide a precise probability, but we can say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is likely higher than 15%, possibly closer to 20% or even higher, given the higher proportion of tall people in the neighborhood.

{probability: cannot be precisely determined without more information, but is likely higher than 15%}
