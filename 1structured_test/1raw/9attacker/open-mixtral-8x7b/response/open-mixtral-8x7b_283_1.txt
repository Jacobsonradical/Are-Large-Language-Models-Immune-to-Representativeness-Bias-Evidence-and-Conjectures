Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would allow us to update our prior beliefs about the attacker's height based on the victim's observations. Therefore, the best estimate we can provide is based on the population statistics for the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

{probability: 0.2}
