Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller).

However, the fact that the victim could not see the attacker's height might suggest that the attacker was not chosen at random from the general population, but rather from the subset of people who could approach the victim from behind without being seen. If we assume that this subset is more likely to be composed of people who are shorter than 185 cm (since they are less likely to be noticed from behind), then it's possible that the true probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is actually lower than 20%.

On the other hand, it's also possible that the attacker was chosen specifically because of their height (perhaps to intimidate the victim), in which case the true probability could be higher than 20%.

Without further information, it's difficult to make a more precise estimate. However, if we assume that the attacker was chosen at random from the subset of people who could approach the victim from behind without being seen, and that this subset has the same height distribution as the neighborhood population, then we can estimate the probability as follows:

Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to estimate P(H), the probability of this event.

Since the attacker was chosen at random from the subset of people who could approach the victim from behind without being seen, we can write:

P(H) = P(H | short subset) \* P(short subset) + P(H | tall subset) \* P(tall subset)

where "short subset" refers to the subset of people who are shorter than 185 cm, and "tall subset" refers to the subset of people who are 185 cm or taller.

We are given that P(short subset) = 0.8 and P(tall subset) = 0.2. We are also given that P(H | tall subset) = 1 (since all people in the tall subset are 185 cm or taller).

To estimate P(H | short subset), we can use the fact that the neighborhood population is representative of the population of people who could approach the victim from behind. Therefore, we can estimate P(H | short subset) as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2.

Putting it all together, we get:

P(H) = (0.2 \* 0.8) + (1 \* 0.2) = 0.36 + 0.2 = 0.56

So, under these assumptions, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 56%.

Answer: {probability: 0.56}
