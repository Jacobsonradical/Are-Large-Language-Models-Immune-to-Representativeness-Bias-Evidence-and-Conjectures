Without any other information about the attacker, it is still possible to make an estimate based on the given data about the heights of people in the city and the neighborhood.

The attack could have happened anywhere in the city, so it seems reasonable to make a weighted average of the two percentages given: one for the city and one for the neighborhood.

The weighted average formula is:
weighted average = (weight1 * value1 + weight2 * value2) / (weight1 + weight2)

We can apply this to our problem as follows:

Let's assign the weight for the city as w1 and for the neighborhood as w2. Since the attack could have happened anywhere in the city, a reasonable assumption might be that the attacker is equally likely to be from the city or from the neighborhood. This gives us:

w1 = w2 = 0.5

Now, we can calculate the weighted average:

weighted average = (0.5 * 0.15 + 0.5 * 0.2) / (0.5 + 0.5)
weighted average = (0.075 + 0.1) / 1
weighted average = 0.175

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.175 or 17.5%.
