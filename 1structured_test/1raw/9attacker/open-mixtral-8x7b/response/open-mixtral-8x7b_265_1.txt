Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would contradict the height distribution of the general population in the city. Since the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of tall people (20% instead of 15%), the height distribution in this neighborhood is more favorable to the attacker being tall. However, without additional information, we cannot rule out the possibility that the attacker's height is consistent with the city's overall height distribution.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15 or 15%}
