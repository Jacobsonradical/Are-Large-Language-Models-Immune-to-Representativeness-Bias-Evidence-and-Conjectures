Without any other information, it might be tempting to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is the same as in the city as a whole. If we make that assumption, then the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be 20%, since we know that 20% of the population in the neighborhood (and thus, presumably, 20% of the relevant population in the city) is 185 cm or taller.

However, it's also possible that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is different from the distribution in the city as a whole. For example, if the neighborhood is a particularly tall one (perhaps it's a business district with a lot of skyscrapers, or a wealthy area with a lot of professional athletes), then it's possible that a larger-than-average percentage of the population is 185 cm or taller. On the other hand, if the neighborhood is a particularly short one (perhaps it's a low-income area with a lot of children and teenagers), then it's possible that a smaller-than-average percentage of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Without more information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, it's impossible to say for sure what the probability is that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, based on the information we do have, it seems reasonable to assume that the probability is somewhere between 15% (the overall percentage of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller) and 20% (the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller).

So, to answer your question strictly in the following format:

{probability: between 0 and 1}

I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be approximately 0.175, or 17.5%. This is simply the average of the two percentages we have been given (15% and 20%), and it reflects the fact that we don't have enough information to make a more precise estimate.

Of course, if the police investigation uncovers more information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, then this estimate could be revised. For example, if the police learn that the neighborhood is a particularly tall one, then they might revise their estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller upwards. Conversely, if the police learn that the neighborhood is a particularly short one, then they might revise their estimate downwards. Without more information, though, it's impossible to say for sure what the probability is.
