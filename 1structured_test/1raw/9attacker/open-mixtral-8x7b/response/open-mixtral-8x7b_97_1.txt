Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller, this is already somewhat more informative than the city-wide statistics. 

However, since we don't have any information about the attacker's build, age, or other factors that could affect their perceived height, we can only make a rough estimate based on these numbers. 

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

{probability: 0.2}

This is based on the assumption that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole, and that the victim's perception of the attacker's height is unbiased by other factors.
