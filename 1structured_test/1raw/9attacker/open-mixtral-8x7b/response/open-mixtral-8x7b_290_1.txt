Based on the information provided, even though the victim could not see the attacker's height, we can still make an estimate based on the population distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

The probability that a randomly chosen person in this neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20%. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is also 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
