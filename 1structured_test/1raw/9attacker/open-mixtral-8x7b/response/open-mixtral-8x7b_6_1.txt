Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would allow us to update our initial belief about the attacker's height based on the population as a whole. Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller should still be based on the overall population, which is 15%.

{probability: 0.15}
