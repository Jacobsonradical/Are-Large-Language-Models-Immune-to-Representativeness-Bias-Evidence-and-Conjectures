Without any further information about the victim or the specific neighborhood, we can only make an estimate based on the given population statistics.

Since 15% of the overall population is 185 cm or taller, and the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher percentage of tall people (20%), it is plausible to adjust our estimate based on this information. 

However, it's important to note that the attacker could be from a different neighborhood, and there's no definite proof they belong to the specific neighborhood with the given height distribution. Thus, our estimate should not deviate significantly from the overall population statistic.
