Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the height distribution data for the city to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, so our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
