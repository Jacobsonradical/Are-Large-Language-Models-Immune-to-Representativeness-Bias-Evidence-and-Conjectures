Without any other information, it is reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the proportions given for the city to estimate the probability that a randomly chosen person in this neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.

The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller is equal to the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.

However, the police investigation has found that the neighborhood has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20% or 0.20) than the city as a whole. Since the attacker was likely chosen at random from the people in this neighborhood, it is appropriate to revise our estimate upward to reflect this higher proportion.

Therefore, our final estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}

In other words, we estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
