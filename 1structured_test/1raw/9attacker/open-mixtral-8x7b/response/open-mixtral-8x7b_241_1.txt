Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. That being the case, let's use the percentages provided for the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

There's a 20% chance that a randomly chosen person from the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller. Since we don't have any reason to believe that the attacker is significantly more or less likely to be tall than a randomly chosen person from the neighborhood, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be approximately 0.2 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.2}
