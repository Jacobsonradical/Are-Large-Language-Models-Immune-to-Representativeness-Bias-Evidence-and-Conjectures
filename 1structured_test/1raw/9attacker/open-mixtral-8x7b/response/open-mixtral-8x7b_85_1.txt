Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the information about the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We know that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, there's a 20% chance that a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood has a height of 185 cm or taller. Since we have no reason to believe that the attacker is any different from a randomly chosen person in the neighborhood, it's reasonable to estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is also 20%.

So, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
