Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would contradict the height distribution of the general population in the city. Since the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20% instead of 15%), it's possible that the attacker could be among the taller people, but we have no specific reason to believe the attacker's height distribution would differ significantly from the neighborhood or city statistics.

Therefore, using the city's statistics as a base for our estimate, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
