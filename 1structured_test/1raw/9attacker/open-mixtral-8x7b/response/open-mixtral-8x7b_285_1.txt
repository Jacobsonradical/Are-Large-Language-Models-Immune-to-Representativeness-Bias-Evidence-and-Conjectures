Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the information about the neighborhood to make an estimate.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
