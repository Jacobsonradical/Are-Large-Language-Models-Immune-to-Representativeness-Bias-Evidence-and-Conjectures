Without any further information about the victim or the attacker, it might be tempting to assume that the height distribution of potential attackers corresponds to the height distribution of the general population in the city. However, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood, it seems more reasonable to base our estimate on the height distribution of the residents in that neighborhood.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as p. Then, using the height distribution of the neighborhood, we have:

p = (number of residents who are 185 cm or taller) / (total number of residents)
p = 0.20 (based on the problem statement)

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.20}
