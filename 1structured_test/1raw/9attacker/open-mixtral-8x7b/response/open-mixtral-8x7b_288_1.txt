Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood). However, the victim's inability to see the attacker's height provides some additional information that can be used to update our estimate.

The fact that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height means that the attacker could have been of any height - they were not specifically targeted because of their height. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that the attacker's height was determined by the same distribution as the general population of the neighborhood.

Since we know that 20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller, and we have no reason to believe that the attacker is any different from a randomly selected person from the neighborhood, it seems reasonable to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as 20%.
