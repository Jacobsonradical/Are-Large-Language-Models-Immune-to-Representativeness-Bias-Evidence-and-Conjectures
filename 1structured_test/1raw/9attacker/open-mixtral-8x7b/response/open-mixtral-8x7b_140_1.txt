Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

We are given that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This second percentage is higher than the first, which might lead us to guess that the attacker was also more likely to be 185 cm or taller.

However, the fact that the attack occurred at night and the victim could not see the attacker's height means that this height information cannot influence our estimate. The victim's inability to see the attacker's height means that the attacker's height is not relevant to the crime, and therefore cannot be used to make a more informed estimate.

So, even though we have some information about the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, this information cannot be used to make a more informed estimate about the attacker's height. We are left with the base rate from the city as a whole, which is 15%.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{probability: 0.15}
