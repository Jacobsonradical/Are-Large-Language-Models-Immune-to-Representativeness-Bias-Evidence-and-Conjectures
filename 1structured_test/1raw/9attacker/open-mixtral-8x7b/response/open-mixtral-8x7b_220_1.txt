Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

We are given that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Given that the attacker was chosen at random from the neighborhood population, the attacker has a higher probability of being 185 cm or taller than the city average.

However, since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the attacker's height based on the information provided. We can only estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
