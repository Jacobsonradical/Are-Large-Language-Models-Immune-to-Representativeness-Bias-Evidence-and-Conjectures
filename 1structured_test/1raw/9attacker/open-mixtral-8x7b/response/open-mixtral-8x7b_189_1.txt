Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the information about the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We know that 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is also 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
