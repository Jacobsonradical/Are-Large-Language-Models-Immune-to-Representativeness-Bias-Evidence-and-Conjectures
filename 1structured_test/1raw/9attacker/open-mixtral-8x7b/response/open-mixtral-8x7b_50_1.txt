Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), we actually have even less reason to think the attacker was not tall.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
