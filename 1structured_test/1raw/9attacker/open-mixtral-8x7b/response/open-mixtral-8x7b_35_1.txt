Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and this neighborhood has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), it's plausible that the attacker was also in this taller category. However, we don't have any specific information about the attacker, so any estimate would be somewhat speculative.

With that said, based on the given information, I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

{probability: 0.2, because 20% of the population in the relevant neighborhood is 185 cm or taller}
