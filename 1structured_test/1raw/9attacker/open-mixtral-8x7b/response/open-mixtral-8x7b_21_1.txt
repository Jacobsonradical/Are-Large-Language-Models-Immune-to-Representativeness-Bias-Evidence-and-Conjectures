Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, this means that 20% are 185 cm or taller. Although the victim could not see the attacker's height, they were attacked in this neighborhood where the distribution of height differs from the city as a whole.

Without any other information, the most reasonable estimate would be to use the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the crime occurred. Therefore, based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

{probability: 0.2}
