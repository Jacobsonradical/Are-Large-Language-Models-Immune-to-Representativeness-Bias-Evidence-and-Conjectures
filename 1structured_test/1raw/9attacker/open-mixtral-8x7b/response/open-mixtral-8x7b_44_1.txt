Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller, this is indeed the case. This is already very close to the overall distribution for the city, where 85% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the height distribution in the city and the similar height distribution in the neighborhood, it's reasonable to estimate that the attacker's height was also 185 cm or taller with a probability of around 0.15, or 15%.
