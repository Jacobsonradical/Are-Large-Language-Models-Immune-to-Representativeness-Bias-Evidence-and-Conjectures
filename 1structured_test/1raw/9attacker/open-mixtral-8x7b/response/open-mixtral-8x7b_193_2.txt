Without any further information about the attacker, the best we can do is use the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. We don't have any reason to believe the attacker is not representative of the neighborhood. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
