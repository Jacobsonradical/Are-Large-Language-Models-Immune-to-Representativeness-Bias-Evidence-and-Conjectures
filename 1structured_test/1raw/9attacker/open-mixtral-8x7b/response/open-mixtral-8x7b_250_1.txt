Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood). However, the victim's inability to see the attacker's height provides some additional information.

The fact that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height means that the attacker could have been anyone in the population, not just in the neighborhood. Since the city has a higher percentage of short people (85% vs 80% in the neighborhood), it's more likely that the attacker was one of the 85% of shorter people in the city as a whole. 

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is actually lower than 20%. Specifically, it's 15% (the same as the proportion of tall people in the city as a whole).
