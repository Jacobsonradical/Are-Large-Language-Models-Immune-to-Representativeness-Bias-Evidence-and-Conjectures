The information about the population of the city where the attacker could be from does not help in determining the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. The key information needed is the distribution of heights of people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given that in the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller, it is reasonable to estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
