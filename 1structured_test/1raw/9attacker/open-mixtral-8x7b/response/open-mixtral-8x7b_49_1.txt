Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. If we make this assumption, then we can use the percentages given for the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We are given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
