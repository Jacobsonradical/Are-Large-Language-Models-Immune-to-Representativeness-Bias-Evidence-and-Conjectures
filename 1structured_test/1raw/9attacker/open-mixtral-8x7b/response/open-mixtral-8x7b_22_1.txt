Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, and assuming this neighborhood is representative of the city, it's reasonable to estimate that there's approximately a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
