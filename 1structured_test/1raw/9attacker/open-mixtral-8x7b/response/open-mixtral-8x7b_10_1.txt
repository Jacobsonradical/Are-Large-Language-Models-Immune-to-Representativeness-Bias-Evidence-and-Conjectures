Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that tall). However, the fact that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height introduces some uncertainty.

To account for this uncertainty, we can use a reasoning approach called "maximum entropy" which essentially means that we should distribute our uncertainty evenly among all the possibilities, unless we have specific information that allows us to do otherwise.

In this case, we don't have any information that would make us think that the attacker is more or less likely to be 185 cm or taller than any other height, so we should distribute our uncertainty evenly. Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we might assume that all heights are equally likely.

However, we do have some information about the population in the neighborhood, which is that 20% of people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that there is a higher probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller than if we had no information at all.

One way to estimate this probability is to use a weighted average of the prior probability (the probability before considering the new information) and the probability based on the neighborhood information.

Let's assume that our prior probability is 15% (the overall probability in the city), and the probability based on the neighborhood information is 20%. A simple way to combine these probabilities is to take a weighted average, where the weight is proportional to the amount of information we have about each probability.

Since we have more information about the neighborhood probability than the prior probability, we might choose to weight it more heavily. For example, we might choose to weight the neighborhood probability twice as much as the prior probability. This gives us:

weighted probability = (2 * 20%) + (1 * 15%) = 40% + 15% = 55%

Therefore, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.55}
