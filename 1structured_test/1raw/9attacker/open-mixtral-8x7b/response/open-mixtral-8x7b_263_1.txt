If we don't have any other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the population data to make an estimate. 

The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 15% (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). Since the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of tall people (20%), this suggests that the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is at least as high as in the general population, i.e., at least 15%. 

However, since the attacker was likely a resident of this neighborhood, it might be more appropriate to use the neighborhood data for our estimate. According to this data, the probability that a randomly chosen person in this neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20%.

Therefore, based on the information provided, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
