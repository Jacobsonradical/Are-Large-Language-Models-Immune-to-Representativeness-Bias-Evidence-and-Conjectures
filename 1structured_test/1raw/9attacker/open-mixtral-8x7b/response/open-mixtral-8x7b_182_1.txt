Without any further information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the height distribution of the local population to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Given that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, we can make the following estimate:

{probability: 0.2, explanation: In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, which is the best height-related information we have about the local population.}
