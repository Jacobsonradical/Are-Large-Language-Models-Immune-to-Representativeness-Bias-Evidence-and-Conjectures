Without any further information about the attacker, we have no reason to believe that the attacker's height is different from the general population's heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

In this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
