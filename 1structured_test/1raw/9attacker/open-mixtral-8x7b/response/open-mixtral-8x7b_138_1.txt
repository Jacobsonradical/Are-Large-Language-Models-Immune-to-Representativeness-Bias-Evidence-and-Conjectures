Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would allow us to update our initial belief about the attacker's height based on the population as a whole.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the prior probability based on the population as a whole, which is 15%.

{probability: 0.15}
