Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

If 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, that's very close to the 85% figure for the city as a whole. Therefore, it's unlikely that the attacker's height would significantly change our estimate. 

However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on the assumption that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood is similar to that of the city. If we had reason to believe that the neighborhood has a higher or lower proportion of tall people, we would need to adjust our estimate accordingly.

With that said, based on the information provided, I estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}

This is because we have no reason to believe that the attacker is any more or less likely to be tall than the general population.
