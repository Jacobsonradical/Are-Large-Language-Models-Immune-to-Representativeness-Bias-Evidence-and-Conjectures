If we assume that the distribution of heights in the city is similar to that in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we can use the information about the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We know that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is, of course, an estimate and assumes that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood is similar to that in the city. Other factors, such as the age and gender distribution of the population in the neighborhood, could also affect the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.
