Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the percentages given for the city to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
