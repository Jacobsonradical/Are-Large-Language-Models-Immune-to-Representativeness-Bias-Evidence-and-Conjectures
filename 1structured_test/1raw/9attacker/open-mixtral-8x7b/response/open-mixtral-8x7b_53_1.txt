If we don't have any other information about the attacker, we might use the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred to make an estimate. This seems more relevant than the overall city distribution, since the attack happened there.

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
