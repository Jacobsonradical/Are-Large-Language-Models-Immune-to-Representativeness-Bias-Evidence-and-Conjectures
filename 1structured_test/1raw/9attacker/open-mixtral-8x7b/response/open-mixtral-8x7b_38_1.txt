Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to the distribution of heights in the city as a whole. 

In that case, we can use the information about the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. 

We know that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, assuming that the attacker is representative of the neighborhood population, there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
