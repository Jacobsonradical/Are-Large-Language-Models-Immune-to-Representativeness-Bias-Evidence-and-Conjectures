Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to the distribution of heights in the city as a whole. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, this assumption would suggest that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, or 0.15.

However, since we do have some additional information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we can refine our estimate. Specifically, we know that 80% of the people in this neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, while 20% are 185 cm or taller. This is slightly different from the overall distribution of heights in the city, which suggests that the neighborhood may have a slightly higher proportion of tall people than the city as a whole.

Even so, it's not clear that this difference is large enough to significantly affect our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Without any further information, it seems reasonable to assume that the attacker's height is equally likely to be below or above 185 cm. Therefore, our best estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is still 0.15.
