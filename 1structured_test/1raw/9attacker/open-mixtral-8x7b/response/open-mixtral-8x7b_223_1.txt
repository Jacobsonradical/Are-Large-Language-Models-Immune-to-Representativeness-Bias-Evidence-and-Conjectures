Without any other information, one might assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Given that 15% of people in the city are 185 cm or taller, and assuming this is roughly equivalent to the proportion in the neighborhood, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, we are also given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, which is slightly higher than the city-wide proportion.

To account for this additional information, we can use a weighted average of the two probabilities, giving more weight to the neighborhood proportion since it is more specific to the location of the attack. Specifically, we can calculate the weighted average as:

P(attacker's height >= 185 cm) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.20
= 0.12 + 0.04
= 0.16

So, based on the given information, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.16}
