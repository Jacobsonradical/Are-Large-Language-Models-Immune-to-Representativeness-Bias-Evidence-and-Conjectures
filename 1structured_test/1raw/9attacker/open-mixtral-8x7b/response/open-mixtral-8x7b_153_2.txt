Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the height distribution data for the city to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, if the attacker was chosen at random from the city's population, there would be a 15% chance that they would be 185 cm or taller.

However, the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where the population may have a different height distribution. We are told that 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, which is higher than the citywide average of 15%.

Since the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of tall people, it's possible that the attacker was more likely to be tall than if they had been chosen at random from the city as a whole. However, without any additional information, we have no way of knowing for sure.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is at least 15%, since that is the citywide average. However, it's possible that the probability is higher, given that the attack occurred in a neighborhood with a higher proportion of tall people.

{probability: at least 0.15}
