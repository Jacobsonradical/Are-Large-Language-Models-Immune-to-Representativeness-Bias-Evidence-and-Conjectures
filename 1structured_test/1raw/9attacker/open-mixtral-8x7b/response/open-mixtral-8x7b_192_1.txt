Without any further information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the height distribution of the local population to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Since 20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.2, because 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller}
