Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and in the neighborhood, this percentage is 20%. Given that the attacker was chosen at random from the neighborhood, it's more likely that they are 185 cm or taller than if the attacker had been chosen at random from the city as a whole.

However, without more specific information about the heights of people in the neighborhood, we can't give a precise probability. But we can say that the probability is at least 0.2 (20%), since we know that at least 20% of the population in that neighborhood is 185 cm or taller.

So, the answer is:

{probability: at least 0.2}
