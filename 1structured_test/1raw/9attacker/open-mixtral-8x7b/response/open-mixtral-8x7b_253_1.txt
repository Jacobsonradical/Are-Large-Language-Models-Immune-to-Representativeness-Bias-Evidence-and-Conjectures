Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, this means that the attacker, who was taller than the victim and thus taller than 185 cm (since the victim could not see the attacker's height, the attacker must be taller than the threshold height of 185 cm), must be among the 20% tallest people in the neighborhood.

Since we don't have any other information about the height distribution of people in the neighborhood, we can only use this 20% figure to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
