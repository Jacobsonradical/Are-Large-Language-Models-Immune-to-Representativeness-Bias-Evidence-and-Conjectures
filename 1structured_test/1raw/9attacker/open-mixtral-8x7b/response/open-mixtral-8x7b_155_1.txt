Given that the attacker's height is unknown to the victim, the only information we can use is the distribution of height in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. We don't have any reason to believe that the attacker doesn't live in this neighborhood. Therefore, we can use the height distribution in this neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

The probability that an individual in this neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20%, so our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
