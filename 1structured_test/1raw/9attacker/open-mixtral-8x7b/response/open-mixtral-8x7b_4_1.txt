Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, I will make the simplifying assumption that the two populations have the same distribution of heights.

We are given that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we cannot directly use this information.

Instead, we can consider the probability that a randomly chosen person from the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller, and use this as an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. This is because we are assuming that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood is the same as that of the city.

We are given that 20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
