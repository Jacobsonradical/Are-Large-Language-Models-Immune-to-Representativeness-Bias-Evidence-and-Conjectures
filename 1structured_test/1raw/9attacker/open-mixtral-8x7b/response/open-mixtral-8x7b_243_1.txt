Given that the attack occurred from behind, the victim would not have been able to see the attacker's height. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being at least 185 cm tall should be based on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, not the city as a whole.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
