Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would contradict the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Therefore, it is reasonable to use the height distribution of the neighborhood to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
