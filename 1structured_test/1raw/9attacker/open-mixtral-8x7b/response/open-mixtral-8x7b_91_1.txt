Without any further information about the population in the city and the neighborhood, we cannot definitively say that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood is the same as in the city. However, since the attacker is likely to be a local resident, it is reasonable to use the height distribution in the neighborhood for our estimate.

We are given that in the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
