Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, the only information we have to estimate the attacker's height comes from the population data of the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on this information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
