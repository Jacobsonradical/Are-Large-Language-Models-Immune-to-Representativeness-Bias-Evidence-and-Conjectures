Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

We are given that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This second percentage is higher than the first, which might lead us to believe that it's more likely that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, we don't have any information that would allow us to make a more informed estimate.

So, based on the information given, I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

{probability: 0.15 to 0.20, depending on how closely the neighborhood's population matches the city's as a whole}
