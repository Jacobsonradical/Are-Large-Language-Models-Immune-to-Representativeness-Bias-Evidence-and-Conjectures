Without any other information about the attacker, it is still possible to make an estimate based on the given data about the heights of people in the city and the neighborhood.

Since 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, it means that 20% or 1 in 5 people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Given that the attack could have been committed by anyone in the city, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be based on the city's statistics, which is 15%.

However, since the crime occurred in a neighborhood where a larger percentage of people are 185 cm or taller compared to the city average, it could suggest that there might be a higher chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We don't have enough information to determine if the neighborhood's statistics are representative of the attacker's height, but we can adjust the probability based on the given neighborhood data.

A reasonable estimate would be to take a weighted average of the city's and neighborhood's percentages:

Weighted average = (City's percentage * Population size ratio) + (Neighborhood's percentage * Crime location ratio)

Since we don't have specific population size or crime location data, let's assume that the crime location ratio is 1 (equal importance) and the population size ratio is unknown but less than 1 (city population is larger than the neighborhood's). With these assumptions:

Weighted average = (0.15 * unknown ratio) + (0.2 * 1)

Let's say the population size ratio is 0.8, then:

Weighted average = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.2 * 1) = 0.12 + 0.2 = 0.32

Based on this rough calculation, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be around 0.32.
