Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as in the neighborhood where the attack occurred). However, the key piece of information here is that the victim could not see the attacker's height. This means that the attacker's height is not related to the population statistics of the neighborhood.

Therefore, the relevant population statistics are those of the city as a whole, which indicate that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Thus, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
