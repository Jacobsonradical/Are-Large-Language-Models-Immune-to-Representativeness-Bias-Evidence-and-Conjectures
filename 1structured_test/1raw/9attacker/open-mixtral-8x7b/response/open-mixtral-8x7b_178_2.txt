Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the given percentages to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We know that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Assuming that this is also true for the attacker, we can estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.2, since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, and we are assuming that the attacker is representative of the neighborhood population.}
