Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood). However, the victim's inability to see the attacker's height might introduce some uncertainty, making the actual probability slightly less than 20%.

That being said, without any specific data about how this uncertainty might affect the probability, it's reasonable to stick with the original estimate based on the neighborhood's population.
