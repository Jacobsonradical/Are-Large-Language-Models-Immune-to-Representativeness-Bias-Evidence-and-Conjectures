Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood). However, the victim's inability to see the attacker's height provides some information that should be taken into account.

If attacks were equally likely to occur at any height, then the victim's inability to see the attacker's height would not provide any additional information. But if taller attackers are more likely to attack from behind and prevent their victims from seeing their height, then the victim's inability to see the attacker's height might suggest that the attacker was more likely to be tall.

Of course, this is speculative, and there is no way to know for sure without more information. But if we assume that taller attackers are more likely to attack from behind and prevent their victims from seeing their height, then we might adjust our estimate of the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller upwards.

Without knowing how much more likely taller attackers are to attack from behind, it is difficult to give a precise estimate. But as a rough guess, I might estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller to be something like 30-40%.

So, my answer would be:

{probability: 0.3-0.4}
