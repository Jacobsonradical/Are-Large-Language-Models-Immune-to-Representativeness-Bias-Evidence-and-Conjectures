The information about the population of the city where the attacker could be from doesn't help us in estimating the height of the attacker. What is important is the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since we know nothing else about the attacker, this is the best estimate we have for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.20}
