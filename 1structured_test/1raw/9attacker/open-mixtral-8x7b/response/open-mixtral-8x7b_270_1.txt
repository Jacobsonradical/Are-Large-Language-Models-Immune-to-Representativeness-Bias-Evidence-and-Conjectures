Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller and the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of tall people (20%), it's reasonable to assume that the attacker was more likely to be tall.

Let's consider two possibilities: the neighborhood's population is a good representation of the attacker's pool, or the attacker is not a resident and thus the population statistics don't apply.

1. If the neighborhood's population is representative, there's a 20% chance the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. If not, and assuming the attacker is equally likely to be from any part of the city, then there's an 85% chance they're shorter than 185 cm, making a 15% chance they're 185 cm or taller. Since the neighborhood has a higher proportion, we might lean towards the 20% figure, but without more specific information, it's hard to adjust this probability.

Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

{probability: 0.2}
