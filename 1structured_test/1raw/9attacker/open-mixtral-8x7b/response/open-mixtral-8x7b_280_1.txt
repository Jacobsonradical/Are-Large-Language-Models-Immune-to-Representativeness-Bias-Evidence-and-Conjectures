Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood). However, the victim's inability to see the attacker's height provides some additional information.

Given that the victim could not see the attacker's height, it suggests that the attacker could have been of any height with equal probability. Therefore, the relevant proportion to consider is not the 20% of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, but the 20% of the total population who are 185 cm or taller.

Since 15% of the total population is 185 cm or taller, and there is no reason to believe the attacker is more or less likely to be tall than any other person, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is also 15%.
