Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, I will make the simplifying assumption that the probability of a random person being shorter than 185 cm or tally is the same in the city and in this specific neighborhood.

Based on this assumption, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

1. We start with the prior probability, which is the overall percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city (15% or 0.15).
2. Next, we incorporate the new evidence that the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher percentage of tall people (20% or 0.20).
3. Since the attacker came from this neighborhood, we update our prior probability using Bayes' theorem:

posterior probability = (prior probability × probability of neighborhood) / probability of tall person in the city

4. Plugging in the numbers, we get:

posterior probability = (0.15 × 0.20) / (0.15) ≈ 0.20 or 20%

Therefore, given the information provided, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
