Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we cannot definitively determine the attacker's height based on the information provided. However, using the statistical data for the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

The probability that a randomly selected person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20%, so our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
