Without any further information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. This is because the attacker is likely to be a resident or frequent visitor of that neighborhood.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Here is the answer in the requested format:

{probability: 0.20}
