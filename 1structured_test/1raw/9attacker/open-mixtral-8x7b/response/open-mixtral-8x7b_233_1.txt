Based on the information provided, even though the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can still make an estimate based on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

The attacker is at least as tall as the 20th percentile of heights in that neighborhood, since 20% of the people there are 185 cm or taller. 

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is at least 20%. 

{probability: 0.20}
