Without any further information about the population in the city and the neighborhood, we cannot definitively say that they are the same. However, since we have no other information, let's assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood is the same as in the city.

Given that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, and we assume the same for the neighborhood where the crime occurred, even though the police investigation found that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we would still use the city-wide statistic since it's more general and applies to the entire city population.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
