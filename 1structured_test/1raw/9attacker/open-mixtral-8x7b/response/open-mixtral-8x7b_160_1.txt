Given that the attacker's height is unknown to the victim, the only relevant information is the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, this is also the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
