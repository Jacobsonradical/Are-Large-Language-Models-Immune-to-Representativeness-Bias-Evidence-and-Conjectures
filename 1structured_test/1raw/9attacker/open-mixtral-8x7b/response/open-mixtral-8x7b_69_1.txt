Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood). However, the victim's inability to see the attacker's height provides some additional information.

Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, it's possible that the attacker was taller than the victim. If the victim is shorter than 185 cm (which is the case for 85% of the population), then the attacker has a higher-than-20% chance of being 185 cm or taller, because the attacker could be taller than the victim.

Let's assume that the victim is shorter than 185 cm (which is true for 85% of the population). In that case, the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is only dependent on whether the attacker is taller than the victim, not on the general population distribution.

Since the attacker could be anyone in the population, the probability that the victim is shorter than the attacker is 85%, and the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is therefore 20% * 0.85 + 15% * 0.15 = 17% + 2.25% = 19.25%.

However, since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, it's possible (but unprovable) that the attacker was actually shorter than the victim. To reflect our uncertainty about the victim's height, we could take a weighted average of the two possibilities, weighted by the probabilities that the victim is taller or shorter than 185 cm.

Assuming the victim is equally likely to be taller or shorter than 185 cm, we would take the average of the probability when the victim is shorter (19.25%) and the probability when the victim is taller (20%). The final estimate would be (19.25% + 20%) / 2 = **19.625%**.

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.19625}.
