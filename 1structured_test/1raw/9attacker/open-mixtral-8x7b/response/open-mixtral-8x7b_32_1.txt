Without any other information, it might be tempting to use the percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15%. However, since the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where the proportion of tall people is different, we should use that information instead.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, based on the information provided, the best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
