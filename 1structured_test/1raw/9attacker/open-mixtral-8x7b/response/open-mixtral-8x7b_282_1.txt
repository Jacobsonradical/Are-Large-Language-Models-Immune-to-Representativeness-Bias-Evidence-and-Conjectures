Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), it's reasonable to assume that the attacker was also more likely to be tall.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.05 = 0.20 or 20%}

This estimate takes into account the higher prevalence of tall people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, and assumes that the distribution of heights in this neighborhood is similar to that of the city as a whole. However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate, and that additional information about the attacker or the victim could potentially alter our estimate.
