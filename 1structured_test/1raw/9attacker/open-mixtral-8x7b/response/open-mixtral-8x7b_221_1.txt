Without any further information about the attacker, it is still possible to make an estimate based on the given data about the heights of people in the city and the neighborhood.

Since 80% of the neighborhood's population is shorter than 185 cm, it means that 20% or 1 in 5 people are 185 cm or taller. Given that the attacker was in that neighborhood, it is reasonable to use the neighborhood's data to make an estimate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2 or 20%}
