If we don't have any other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the height distribution of the local population as a basis for our estimate.

Since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that there's a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

{probability: 0.2}
