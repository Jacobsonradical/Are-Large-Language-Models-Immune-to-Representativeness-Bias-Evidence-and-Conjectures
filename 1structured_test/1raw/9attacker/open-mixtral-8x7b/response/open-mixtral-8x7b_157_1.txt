Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, we have no information that would allow us to make a more informed estimate. Therefore, we must rely on the population data provided for the city and the neighborhood.

For the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and for the neighborhood, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Since we don't have any information suggesting that the attacker is more likely to be from the neighborhood than from the city as a whole, we can't use the neighborhood data to refine our estimate.

Therefore, based on the city-wide data, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
