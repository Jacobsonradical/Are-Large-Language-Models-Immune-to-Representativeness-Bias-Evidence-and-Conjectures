Without any further information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. This is because the attacker is likely to be a resident or frequent visitor of that neighborhood.

We are given that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, which corresponds to a probability of 0.2.
