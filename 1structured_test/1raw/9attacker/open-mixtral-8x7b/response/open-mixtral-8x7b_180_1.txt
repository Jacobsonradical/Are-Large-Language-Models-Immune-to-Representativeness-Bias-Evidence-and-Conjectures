Given that the person was attacked from behind and the victim could not see the attacker's height, the attacker's height is independent of the population statistics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the probability of an arbitrary person in the city being 185 cm or taller. According to the city's population statistics, 15% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
