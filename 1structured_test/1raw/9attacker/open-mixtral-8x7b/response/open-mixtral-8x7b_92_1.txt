Without any other information, it's not possible to give a precise probability. However, we can use the given statistics to make a reasonable estimate.

The attacker could be anyone in the city, and 15% of them are 185 cm or taller. The fact that the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller doesn't significantly change this probability, unless there is a reason to believe that the attacker is a local. If we assume that the attacker is equally likely to be from any neighborhood, then the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would still be 15%, as the attacker's height is independent of the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

However, if we consider the possibility that the attacker is a local, then we might adjust our estimate based on the neighborhood statistics. But even in this case, it's not clear that the probability would increase to 20%, since the attacker could still be from the 15% of city residents who are 185 cm or taller. Without more specific information, it's not possible to make a more precise estimate.

So, based on the given information, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would still be:

{probability: 0.15}
