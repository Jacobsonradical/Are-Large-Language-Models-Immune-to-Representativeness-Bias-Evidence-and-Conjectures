Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and this neighborhood has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), we would expect the attacker to be even more likely to be tall.

However, without specific information about the attacker's build, style of dress, or other distinguishing features, it's difficult to make a precise estimate. Based on the height data alone, we can say that:

{probability: at least 0.15, but possibly higher depending on how representative the neighborhood is of the city as a whole}
