Given that the population distribution in the city is 85% shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we would expect the same or similar distribution in any neighborhood in the city. The neighborhood where the attack occurred has a slightly higher percentage of tall people, 20% instead of 15%. However, without more specific information about the neighborhood, it is reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in this neighborhood is not significantly different from the city average.

Therefore, even though the attacker's height could not be seen, based on the overall population distribution in the city, we can estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is close to the city average of 15%.

{probability: 0.15}
