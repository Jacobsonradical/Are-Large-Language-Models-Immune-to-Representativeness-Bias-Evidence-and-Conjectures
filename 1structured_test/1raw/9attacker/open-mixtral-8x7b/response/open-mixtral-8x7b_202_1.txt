Without any further information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the height distribution of the neighborhood where the attack occurred to estimate the attacker's height. We are told that in this neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. 

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
