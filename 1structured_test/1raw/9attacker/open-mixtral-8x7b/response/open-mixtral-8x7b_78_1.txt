Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and this neighborhood has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), it's plausible that the attacker was also in this taller group. However, we don't have direct evidence about the attacker's height, so this is only an estimate.
