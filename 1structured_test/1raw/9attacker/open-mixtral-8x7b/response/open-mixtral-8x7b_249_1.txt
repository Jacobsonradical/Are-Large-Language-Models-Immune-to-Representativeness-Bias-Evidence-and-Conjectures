Given that we know nothing about the attacker other than the population statistics of the neighborhood where the attack occurred, we can use the height distribution of that neighborhood to estimate the probability of the attacker's height.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
