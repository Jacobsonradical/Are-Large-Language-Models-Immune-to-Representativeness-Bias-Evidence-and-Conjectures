Without any other information about the attacker, it is still possible to make an estimate based on the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. We know that 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. In the absence of any reason to assume that the attacker's height is related to the height distribution in the city as a whole, it seems reasonable to base our estimate on the neighborhood data.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
