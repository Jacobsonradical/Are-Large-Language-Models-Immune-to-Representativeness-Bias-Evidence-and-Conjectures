Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the given statistics to make an estimate.

The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city is 15% (or 0.15). Since the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of tall people (20% or 0.20), we would expect the probability of the attacker being tall to be at least as high as in the city as a whole.

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is based on the assumption that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood is similar to that of the city. If we had more information about the specific characteristics of the neighborhood or the victim, we might be able to make a more refined estimate.
