Without any other information about the attacker, we have no reason to believe that the attacker's height is different from the general population in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Therefore, we can use the height distribution in this neighborhood to make an estimate.

We know that 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
