Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that tall). However, the fact that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height introduces some uncertainty.

One way to reason about this uncertainty is to consider a range of possible heights for the attacker. Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we might assume that the attacker could have been anywhere between 0 cm and 250 cm tall (a very generous range). Under this assumption, we can calculate the probability that a randomly chosen person from the neighborhood would be 185 cm or taller. This probability is still 20%, since the height of a randomly chosen person is not affected by the range of possible heights for the attacker.

However, we might also consider the possibility that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, but still tall enough to be a threat. For example, the attacker might have been 180 cm tall, which is taller than 95% of the population in the neighborhood. If we assume that the attacker was at least this tall, then the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is lower than 20%. Specifically, it is the proportion of people who are taller than 180 cm and also 185 cm or taller, which is 5% (0.20 - 0.15 = 0.05).

On the other hand, if we assume that the attacker was even taller than 185 cm, then the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than 20%. For example, if we assume that the attacker was 190 cm tall, then the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 95% (since 95% of the population is shorter than 190 cm and all of those people are also 185 cm or taller).

Overall, then, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller depends on our assumptions about the attacker's height. If we assume that the attacker could have been anywhere between 0 cm and 250 cm tall, then the probability is 20%. If we assume that the attacker was at least 180 cm tall, then the probability is 5%. If we assume that the attacker was at least 190 cm tall, then the probability is 95%. Without any additional information, it is difficult to make a more precise estimate.

So, my answer is:
{probability: 0.20, with a range of possible values between 0.05 and 0.95, depending on our assumptions about the attacker's height}
