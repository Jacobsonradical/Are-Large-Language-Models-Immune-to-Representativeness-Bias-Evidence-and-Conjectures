Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Therefore, we can use the neighborhood statistics to make an estimate.

In the neighborhood, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, there's a 20% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
