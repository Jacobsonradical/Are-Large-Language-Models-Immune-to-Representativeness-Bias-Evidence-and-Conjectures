Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that tall). However, the fact that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height introduces some uncertainty.

One way to approach this problem is to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is that there's a 20% chance that a randomly chosen person from the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller. The new evidence is that the attacker was tall enough to attack someone from behind.

Since we don't know how much taller than 185 cm the attacker might have been, we can't use this evidence to narrow down the possible heights of the attacker. However, we can use the fact that the attacker was tall enough to attack someone from behind to update our prior belief that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

To do this, we need to calculate the likelihood of the evidence (the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller) under the two possible hypotheses (the attacker is or is not 185 cm or taller). Since we don't have any information about the attacker's height beyond the fact that they were tall enough to attack someone from behind, we can assume that this likelihood is the same for both hypotheses.

Therefore, the likelihood ratio (the likelihood of the evidence under the first hypothesis divided by the likelihood of the evidence under the second hypothesis) is 1, and Bayes' theorem simplifies to:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

where A is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, E is the evidence that the attacker was tall enough to attack someone from behind, P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, P(E|A) is the likelihood of the evidence given the first hypothesis, and P(E) is the total probability of the evidence.

Since the likelihood ratio is 1, P(E|A) = P(E), and we can simplify this further to:

P(A|E) = P(A)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is still 20%, the same as our prior belief.
