Without any other information, it seems reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. Since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller, and the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a slightly higher proportion of tall people (20%), it's plausible that the attacker was also more likely to be tall.

However, it's important to note that the victim's inability to see the attacker's height introduces uncertainty into our estimate. We can't be certain that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and we don't have any other information to help us make a more informed estimate.

With these caveats in mind, we can still make a rough estimate based on the available information. Since 20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller, we might estimate that there is a 20% chance that the attacker's height was also 185 cm or taller.
