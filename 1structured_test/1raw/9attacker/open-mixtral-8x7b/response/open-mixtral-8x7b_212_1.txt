If we have no reason to assume that the attacker was not chosen at random from the local population, then we can use the height distribution of the neighborhood to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is because the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is a characteristic that depends only on the attacker's height, and not on any other factors.

The probability of a randomly chosen person from the neighborhood being 185 cm or taller is 20%, since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
