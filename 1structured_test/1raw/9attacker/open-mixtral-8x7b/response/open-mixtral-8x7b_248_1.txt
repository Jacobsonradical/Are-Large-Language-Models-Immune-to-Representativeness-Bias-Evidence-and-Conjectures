Without any other information, it might be tempting to say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 20% (the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are that tall). However, the fact that the victim couldn't see the attacker's height introduces some uncertainty.

One way to approach this problem is to use a range of plausible heights for the attacker, based on the fact that they were able to attack the victim from behind. For example, let's assume that the attacker was between 150 cm and 210 cm tall (a range that includes most adults, but excludes very short or very tall individuals who might be less likely to be able to attack someone from behind).

Given this range of plausible heights, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as follows:

* The probability that a randomly chosen person from the neighborhood is between 150 cm and 184 cm is 80% * 0.15 + 20% * 0.8 = 0.32 + 0.16 = 0.48
* The probability that a randomly chosen person from the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20% * 0.2 = 0.04
* Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given our assumptions about their height, is 0.04 / (0.04 + 0.48) = 0.077 or 7.7%

Of course, this is just one possible way to estimate the probability, and different assumptions about the attacker's height could lead to different estimates. However, based on the information provided, I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

{probability: 0.077}
