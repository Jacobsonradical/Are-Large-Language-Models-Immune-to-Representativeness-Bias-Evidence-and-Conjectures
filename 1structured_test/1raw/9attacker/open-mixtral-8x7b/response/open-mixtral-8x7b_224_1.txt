If we don't have any other information about the attacker, it's reasonable to use the height distribution of the local population as a basis for our estimate.

Since 20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller, we can use this percentage as our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Therefore,

{probability: 0.2}
