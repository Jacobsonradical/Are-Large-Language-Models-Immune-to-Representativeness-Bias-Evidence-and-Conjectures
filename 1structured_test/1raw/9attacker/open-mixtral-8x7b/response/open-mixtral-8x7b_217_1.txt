If we don't have any other information about the attacker, the best estimate for the attacker's height would be based on the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred. 

Given that 20% of the people in this neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
