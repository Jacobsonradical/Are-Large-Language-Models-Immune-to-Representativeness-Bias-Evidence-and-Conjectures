Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

We are given that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller. 

Given that the attacker was chosen at random from the neighborhood, and we have no reason to believe that the attacker's height is related to other factors, it's reasonable to use the 20% figure as our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

So, {probability: 0.2}.
