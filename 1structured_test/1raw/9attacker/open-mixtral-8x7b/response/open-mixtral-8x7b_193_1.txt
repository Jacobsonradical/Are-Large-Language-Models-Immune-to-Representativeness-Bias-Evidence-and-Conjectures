Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm and the attacker is part of this population, it means that the attacker is in the taller half of the people in the neighborhood. 

Since 15% of the people in the city are 185 cm or taller, and the neighborhood figures (80% and 20%) are based on the city population, it implies that at least 20% of the neighborhood population is also 185 cm or taller (they could be higher than the city average, but not lower).

Therefore, given that the attacker is in the taller half of the neighborhood population, and the taller half includes at least 20% of the people who are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is at least 0.2, or 20%.

However, without more specific information about the distribution of heights in the neighborhood or the attacker's precise position in the height distribution, we can't provide a more precise estimate.

So, the answer is:
{probability: at least 0.2}
