Without any other information, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred is similar to that of the city as a whole. 

Given that 80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller, this is already somewhat similar to the city-wide distribution you provided. 

However, since 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm and the neighborhood figures are slightly more permissive of taller individuals, it's plausible that the attacker was more likely to be 185 cm or taller than the city-wide average.

But without any other information, it's hard to provide a more precise estimate. Therefore, I will estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

{probability: 0.25, with a range of 0.2 to 0.3}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the neighborhood figures are a good approximation of the city-wide distribution, and that the attacker was slightly more likely to be taller than the city-wide average.
