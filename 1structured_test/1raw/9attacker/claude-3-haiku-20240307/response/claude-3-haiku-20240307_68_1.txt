To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we need to consider the relative proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood compared to the city.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as:
{probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Explanation:
The proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood is 20% (0.2), while in the city it is 15%. Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (20%).
