To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood.

Given:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we need to consider the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the information about the neighborhood.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as:
{probability: 0.20}

This is because the information provided indicates that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, and this represents the best estimate for the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.
