To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we need to consider the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the population distribution in the neighborhood.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%, which is the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.20}
