To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we need to consider the relative proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood compared to the city.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.2}

This is because the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood is 20%, which is higher than the 15% in the city. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.2 or 20%.
