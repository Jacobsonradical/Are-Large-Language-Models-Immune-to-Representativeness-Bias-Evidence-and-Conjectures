To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

The reason for this estimate is that since the neighborhood has a higher percentage of people 185 cm or taller compared to the city (20% vs. 15%), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is higher in the neighborhood.
