To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller in the city.
- P(B) is the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Step 1: Calculate P(A)
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the city population is 185 cm or taller)

Step 2: Calculate P(B|A)
P(B|A) = 0.20 (since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)

Step 3: Calculate P(B)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.85) + (0.20 * 0.15) = 0.68 + 0.03 = 0.71

Step 4: Calculate P(A|B)
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.71 = 0.0423

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, is:

{probability: 0.0423}
