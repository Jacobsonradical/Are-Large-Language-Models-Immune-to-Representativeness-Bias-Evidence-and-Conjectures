To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be calculated using Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's height and the neighborhood's height distribution.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, can be expressed as:

P(attacker's height ≥ 185 cm | neighborhood) = (P(neighborhood | attacker's height ≥ 185 cm) * P(attacker's height ≥ 185 cm)) / P(neighborhood)

where:
P(neighborhood | attacker's height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.20 (the proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood)
P(attacker's height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (the proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the city)
P(neighborhood) = (0.80 * 0.85) + (0.20 * 0.15) = 0.75 (the proportion of people in the neighborhood)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(attacker's height ≥ 185 cm | neighborhood) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.75 = 0.04

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.04}
