To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.80 * 0.85) + (0.20 * 0.15) = 0.77 (the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.77 = 0.039

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.039 or 3.9%.
