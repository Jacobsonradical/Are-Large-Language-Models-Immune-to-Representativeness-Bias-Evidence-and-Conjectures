To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood where 80% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 20% is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood with the described population distribution.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the neighborhood distribution given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.20 (20% of the population in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller).
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller).
- P(B) is the probability of the neighborhood distribution, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.20 * 0.15 + 0.80 * 0.85 = 0.77

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.77 = 0.039 (approximately)

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.039}
