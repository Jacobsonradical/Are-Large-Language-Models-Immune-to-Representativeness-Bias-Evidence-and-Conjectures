To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the population height distribution in the city and the neighborhood.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

The attacker's height is more likely to be representative of the neighborhood's height distribution, as the attack occurred in that specific location.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
