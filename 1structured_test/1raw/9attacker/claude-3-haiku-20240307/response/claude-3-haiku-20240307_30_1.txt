To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

We can calculate the probabilities as follows:
P(B|A) = 0.20 (the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a person's height is 185 cm or taller in the city)
P(B) = 0.20 (the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood)

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.20 = 0.15

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
