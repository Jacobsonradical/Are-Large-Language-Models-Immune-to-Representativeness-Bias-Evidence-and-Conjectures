To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we need to consider the relative proportions of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The percentage of people who are 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood is 20% or 0.2. This is the best estimate we can make based on the given information, as the attacker could have been any individual from the neighborhood.
