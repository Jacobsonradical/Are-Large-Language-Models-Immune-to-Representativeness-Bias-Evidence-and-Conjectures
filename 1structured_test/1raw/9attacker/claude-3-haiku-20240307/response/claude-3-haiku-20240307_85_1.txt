To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we need to consider the relative proportions of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city and the neighborhood.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the information provided indicates that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller, which is a higher proportion than the city-wide average of 15%.
