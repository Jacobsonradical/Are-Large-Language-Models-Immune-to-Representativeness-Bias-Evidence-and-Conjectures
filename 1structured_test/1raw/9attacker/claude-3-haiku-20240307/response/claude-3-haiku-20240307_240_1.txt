To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given:
- In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we can assume that the attacker's height is representative of the height distribution in the neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
