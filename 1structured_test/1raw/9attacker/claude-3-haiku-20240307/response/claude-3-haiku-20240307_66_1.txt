To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

Probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller = 0.20

Therefore, the answer should be:

{probability: 0.20}
