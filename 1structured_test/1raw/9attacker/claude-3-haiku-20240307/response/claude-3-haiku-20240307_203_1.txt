To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the percentage of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.80 * 0.85) + (0.20 * 0.15) = 0.745 (the total percentage of people in the neighborhood)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.745 = 0.0402

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0402}
