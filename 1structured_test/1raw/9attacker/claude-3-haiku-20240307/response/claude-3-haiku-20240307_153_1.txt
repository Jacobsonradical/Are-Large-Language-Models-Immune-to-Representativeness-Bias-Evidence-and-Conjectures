To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we need to consider the relative proportions of people 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood compared to the city.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is given by:
{probability: 0.2}

This is because the attacker is more likely to be from the 20% of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, rather than the 15% of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller.
