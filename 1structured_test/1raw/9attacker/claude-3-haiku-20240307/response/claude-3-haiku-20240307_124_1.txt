To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the population statistics in the city and the neighborhood.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (the probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.80 * 0.85) + (0.20 * 0.15) = 0.74 (the total probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.74 = 0.0405 / 0.74 = 0.0548

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0548}
