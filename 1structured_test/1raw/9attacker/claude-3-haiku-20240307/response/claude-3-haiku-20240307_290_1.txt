To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the given information about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

The attacker's height is more likely to be 185 cm or taller if the proportion of people 185 cm or taller is higher in the neighborhood compared to the city.

The proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the neighborhood is 20%.
The proportion of people 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
