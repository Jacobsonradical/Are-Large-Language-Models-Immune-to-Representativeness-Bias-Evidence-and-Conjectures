To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood where 80% are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = 0.20 (20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.20 = 0.15

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
