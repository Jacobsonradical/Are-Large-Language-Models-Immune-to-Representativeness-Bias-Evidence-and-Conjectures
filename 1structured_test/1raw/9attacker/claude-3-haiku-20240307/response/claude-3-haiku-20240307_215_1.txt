To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is that since the neighborhood where the attack occurred has a higher proportion of people 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the overall city (15%), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%.
