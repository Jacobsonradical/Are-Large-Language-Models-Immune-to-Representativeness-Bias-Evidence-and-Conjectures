To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller, so P(B|A) = 0.20.
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(B|not A) = 0.80.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.20 * 0.15 + 0.80 * 0.85 = 0.73

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.73 = 0.041

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, is:

{probability: 0.041}
