To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood.

In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, the attack occurred in a neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Assuming that the attacker is a random person from the neighborhood, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
