To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be calculated as follows:

The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 20% (since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
