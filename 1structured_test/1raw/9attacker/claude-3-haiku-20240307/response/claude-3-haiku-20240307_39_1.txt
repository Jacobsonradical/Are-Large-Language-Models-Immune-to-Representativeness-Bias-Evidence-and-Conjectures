To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the height distributions in the city and the neighborhood.

Given:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we need to consider the relative likelihood of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the height distribution in the neighborhood.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}

This is because the neighborhood has a higher proportion of people 185 cm or taller (20%) compared to the overall city (15%), so the attacker is more likely to be in the taller group.
