Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood where 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (based on the information that 15% of the city population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (based on the information that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = 0.20 (based on the information that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.20 = 0.15

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
