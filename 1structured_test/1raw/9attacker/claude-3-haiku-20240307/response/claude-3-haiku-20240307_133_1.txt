To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood.

Given:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the probability of the attacker being in the 20% group of taller individuals in the neighborhood.

{probability: 0.20}
