To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The person being attacked is from the neighborhood where the attack occurred

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = 0.80 (80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.80
P(A|B) = 0.0375 / 0.80
P(A|B) = 0.046875

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.046875}
