To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the population in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the percentage of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

Therefore, the estimate of the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
