To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the city-wide data)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (from the neighborhood data)
- P(B) = 0.20 (from the neighborhood data)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.20 = 0.15

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
