To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we need to consider the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the information about the neighborhood.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.2}

This is because the information provided indicates that 20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller.
