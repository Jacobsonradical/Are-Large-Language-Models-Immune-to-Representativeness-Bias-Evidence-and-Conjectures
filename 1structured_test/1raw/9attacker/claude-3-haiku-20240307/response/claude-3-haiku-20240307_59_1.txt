To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(B|A) = 0.20.
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(B) = 0.20.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.20
P(A|B) = 0.15

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
