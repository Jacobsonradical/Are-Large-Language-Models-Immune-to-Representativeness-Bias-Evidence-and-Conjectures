To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood where 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = 0.20 (80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.20 = 0.15

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
