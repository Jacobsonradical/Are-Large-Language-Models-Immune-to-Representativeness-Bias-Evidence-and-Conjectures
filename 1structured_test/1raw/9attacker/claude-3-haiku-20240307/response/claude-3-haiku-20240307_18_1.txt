To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Assuming that the attacker's height is representative of the neighborhood's population, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 20%.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.20}
