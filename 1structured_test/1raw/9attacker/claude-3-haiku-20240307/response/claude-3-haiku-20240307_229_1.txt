To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood.

Given:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we need to consider the conditional probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the height distribution in the neighborhood.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is as follows:
The attacker was from the neighborhood, and the probability that a person in the neighborhood is 185 cm or taller is 20% or 0.20.
