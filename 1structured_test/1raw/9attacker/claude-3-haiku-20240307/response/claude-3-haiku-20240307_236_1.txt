To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood where 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Step 1: Calculate P(B|A)
P(B|A) = 0.20 (since 20% of people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)

Step 2: Calculate P(A)
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller)

Step 3: Calculate P(B)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.85) + (0.20 * 0.15) = 0.68 + 0.03 = 0.71

Step 4: Calculate P(A|B)
P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.71 = 0.0423

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0423}
