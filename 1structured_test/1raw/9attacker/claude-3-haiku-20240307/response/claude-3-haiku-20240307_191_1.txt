To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The population in the neighborhood where the attack occurred has 20% of people 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the population in the neighborhood has 20% of people 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the population in the neighborhood has 20% of people 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the population in the neighborhood has 20% of people 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:
- P(B|A) = 20% = 0.20
- P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (the city-wide percentage of people 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = 20% = 0.20 (the neighborhood-specific percentage of people 185 cm or taller)

Plugging these values into the formula:
P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.20 = 0.15

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
