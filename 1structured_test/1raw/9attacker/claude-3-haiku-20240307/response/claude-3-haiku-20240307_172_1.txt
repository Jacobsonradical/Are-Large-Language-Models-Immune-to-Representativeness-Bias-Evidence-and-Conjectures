To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood.

Given:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is that since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, and 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 or 20%.
