To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the height distribution in the city and the neighborhood.

Given information:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the attack occurred in the neighborhood, the height distribution of the people in the neighborhood is more relevant. The given information indicates that 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.20 or 20%.
