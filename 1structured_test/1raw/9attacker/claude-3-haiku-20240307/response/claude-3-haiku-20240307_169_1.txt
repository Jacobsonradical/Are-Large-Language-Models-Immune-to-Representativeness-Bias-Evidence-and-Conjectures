To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Given:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

The attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is more likely to occur in the neighborhood where the attack took place, as the proportion of people 185 cm or taller is higher (20%) compared to the city overall (15%).

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.20}
