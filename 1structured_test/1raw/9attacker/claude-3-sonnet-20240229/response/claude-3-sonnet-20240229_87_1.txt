To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since it is more specific to the location of the incident.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
