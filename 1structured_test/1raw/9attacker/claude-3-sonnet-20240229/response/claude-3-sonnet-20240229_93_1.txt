To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information about the population distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific to the location of the incident.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we don't have any other information about the attacker, we can assume that the attacker is a random member of the population in the neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
