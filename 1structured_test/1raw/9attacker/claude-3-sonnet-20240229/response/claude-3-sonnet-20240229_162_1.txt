To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (or 15%) for the city.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (or 20%).
- P(B) is the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, which we can calculate using the law of total probability:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
  Where A' is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
  P(B|A') = 0.8 (80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm)
  P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the city population is shorter than 185 cm)
  Substituting these values, we get:
  P(B) = 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.71

Now, we can substitute the values into the Bayes' theorem equation:

P(A|B) = (0.2 * 0.15) / 0.71 â‰ˆ 0.0423

{probability: 0.0423}
