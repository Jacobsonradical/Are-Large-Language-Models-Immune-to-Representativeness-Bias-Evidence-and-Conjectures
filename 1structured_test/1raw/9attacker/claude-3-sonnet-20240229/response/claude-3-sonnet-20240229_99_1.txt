To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since this is more specific information than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
