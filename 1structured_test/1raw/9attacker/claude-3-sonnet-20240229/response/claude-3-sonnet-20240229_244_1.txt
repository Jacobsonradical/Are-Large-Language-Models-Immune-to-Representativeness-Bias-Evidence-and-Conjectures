To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events based on the given information.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (20% of the neighborhood population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = Probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood (not given)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
     = 0.20 * 0.15 + P(B|A^c) * 0.85

Since we don't have information about P(B|A^c), we cannot calculate an exact value for P(B). However, we can provide a range for P(A|B) based on the possible values of P(B|A^c).

The minimum value of P(B) occurs when P(B|A^c) = 0, which means:
P(B)_min = 0.20 * 0.15 = 0.03

The maximum value of P(B) occurs when P(B|A^c) = 1, which means:
P(B)_max = 0.20 * 0.15 + 0.85 = 0.88

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

Minimum value of P(A|B):
P(A|B)_min = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.88 = 0.0341 (approximately 3.41%)

Maximum value of P(A|B):
P(A|B)_max = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.03 = 1 (100%)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, lies within the range of 3.41% to 100%.
