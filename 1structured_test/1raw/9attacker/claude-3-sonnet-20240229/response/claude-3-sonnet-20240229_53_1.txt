To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) is unknown, but we can calculate it using the law of total probability:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
  P(B|A^c) = 0.80 (80% of the people in the neighborhood are shorter than 185 cm)
  P(A^c) = 0.85 (85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm)
  P(B) = 0.20 * 0.15 + 0.80 * 0.85 = 0.71

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.71 = 0.042253521126760563

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.042253521126760563}
