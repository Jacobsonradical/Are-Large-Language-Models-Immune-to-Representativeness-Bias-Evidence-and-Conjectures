To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since it is more specific than the general city population data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
- We want the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Assuming that the attacker is from the same neighborhood and the height distribution is representative, we can estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.2}
