To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events based on the prior probabilities and the likelihood of one event given the other.

Given:
- In the city, P(height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15, and P(height < 185 cm) = 0.85.
- In the neighborhood, P(height ≥ 185 cm | neighborhood) = 0.2, and P(height < 185 cm | neighborhood) = 0.8.

We want to find P(neighborhood | height ≥ 185 cm), which is the probability that the attacker is from the neighborhood, given that their height is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(neighborhood | height ≥ 185 cm) = (P(height ≥ 185 cm | neighborhood) × P(neighborhood)) / P(height ≥ 185 cm)

P(neighborhood) is unknown, but we can assume that the neighborhood is a part of the city, so P(neighborhood) < 1.

P(height ≥ 185 cm) = P(height ≥ 185 cm | neighborhood) × P(neighborhood) + P(height ≥ 185 cm | not neighborhood) × P(not neighborhood)
0.15 = 0.2 × P(neighborhood) + 0.15 × (1 - P(neighborhood))
0.15 = 0.2 × P(neighborhood) + 0.15 - 0.15 × P(neighborhood)
0 = 0.05 × P(neighborhood)
P(neighborhood) = 0

Substituting P(neighborhood) = 0 into the Bayes' theorem equation:

P(neighborhood | height ≥ 185 cm) = (0.2 × 0) / 0.15 = 0

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
