To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, I need to use the information given about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since it is more specific than the general city population data.

Given information:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
