{probability: 0.2}

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred. Since the attack happened in that specific neighborhood, the relevant population distribution is the one given for that neighborhood.

According to the information given, in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%.
