To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 20% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (in the city).
- P(B) is the probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood.

We know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller).
We also know that P(B|A) = 0.20 (20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller).

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|¬A) × P(¬A)
     = 0.20 × 0.15 + P(B|¬A) × 0.85

We don't know the value of P(B|¬A), but we can assume that the attack is equally likely to occur in the neighborhood or elsewhere in the city if the attacker's height is less than 185 cm. Therefore, P(B|¬A) = 0.80 (80% of the neighborhood's population is shorter than 185 cm).

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.20 × 0.15 + 0.80 × 0.85
     = 0.03 + 0.68
     = 0.71

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.20 × 0.15) / 0.71
       = 0.04225

{probability: 0.04225}
