To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, rather than the city-wide statistics, since the attack happened in that specific neighborhood.

Given information:
- In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.
- In the neighborhood, 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm.

Since the attacker came from the neighborhood population, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
