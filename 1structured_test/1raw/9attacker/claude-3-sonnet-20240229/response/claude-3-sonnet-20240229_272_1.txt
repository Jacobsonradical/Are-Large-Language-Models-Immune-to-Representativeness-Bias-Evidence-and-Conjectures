To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the population distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since this is more specific than the city-wide distribution.

Given information:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
