To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the evidence that the attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the evidence B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.2 (20% of people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.785 (the probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood, considering both height groups)

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.2 * 0.15) / 0.785
P(A|B) = 0.0382 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0382}
