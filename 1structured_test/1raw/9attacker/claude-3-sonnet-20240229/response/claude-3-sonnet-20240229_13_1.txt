To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific and relevant than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
- The attacker is from the same neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
