To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.20 (20% of the neighborhood population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = ? (We need to find this probability)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
where A^c is the complement of event A (height is shorter than 185 cm).

P(B|A^c) = 0.80 (80% of the neighborhood population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(A^c) = 0.85 (85% of the city population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values:
P(B) = 0.20 * 0.15 + 0.80 * 0.85 = 0.71

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.71
       = 0.0423 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.0423}
