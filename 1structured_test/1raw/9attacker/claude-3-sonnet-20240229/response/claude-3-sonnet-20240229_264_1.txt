To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific to the incident.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as:

{probability: 0.2}
