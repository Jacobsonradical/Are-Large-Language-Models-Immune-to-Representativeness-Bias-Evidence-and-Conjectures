To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
