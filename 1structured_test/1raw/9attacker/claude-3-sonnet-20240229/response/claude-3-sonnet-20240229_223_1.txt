To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.2 (20%) in the problem statement.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B) is the probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood, regardless of the attacker's height. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
  Where A' is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
  P(B|A') is the probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.8 (80%).
  Substituting the values, we get:
  P(B) = 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.71

Now, we can substitute the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.2 * 0.15) / 0.71 = 0.042253521126760563

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.042253521126760563}
