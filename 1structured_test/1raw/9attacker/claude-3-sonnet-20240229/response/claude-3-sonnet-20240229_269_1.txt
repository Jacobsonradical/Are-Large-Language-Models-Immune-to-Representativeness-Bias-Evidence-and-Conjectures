{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- In the city overall, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- However, the attack occurred in a specific neighborhood where 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
- Since we have more specific information about the neighborhood where the attack took place, we should use that data.
- Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%.
