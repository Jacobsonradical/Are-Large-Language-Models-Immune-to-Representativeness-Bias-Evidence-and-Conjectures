To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific to the location of the crime.

Given information:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
