To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- In the city, P(height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15
- In the neighborhood, P(height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.20

Let's denote the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" as A, and the event "the attack occurred in the neighborhood" as B.

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

We know:
P(A) = 0.15 (from the city's population)
P(B|A) = 0.20 (from the neighborhood's population, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
where A' is the event "the attacker's height is less than 185 cm".

We know:
P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
P(B|A') = 0.80 (from the neighborhood's population, given that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm)

Substituting these values, we get:
P(B) = 0.20 * 0.15 + 0.80 * 0.85 = 0.71

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.71 = 0.04225

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.04225}
