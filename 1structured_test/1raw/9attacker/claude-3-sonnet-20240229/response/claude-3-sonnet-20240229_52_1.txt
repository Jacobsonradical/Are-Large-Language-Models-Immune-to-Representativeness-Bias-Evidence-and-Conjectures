To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information given about the population distribution of heights in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as this is more relevant than the city-wide distribution.

Given information:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attacker is from the neighborhood, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
