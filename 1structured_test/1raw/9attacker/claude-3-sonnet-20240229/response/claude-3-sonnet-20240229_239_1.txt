To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific than the city-wide statistics.

Given information:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we don't have any additional information to distinguish between individuals, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood with that height.

{probability: 0.2}
