To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
- We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Since we have no additional information to suggest otherwise, we can assume that the attacker's height follows the same distribution as the neighborhood population.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
