To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the given information about the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since it provides more specific and relevant data than the city-wide distribution.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
- We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Since we have no other information to suggest otherwise, we can assume that the attacker's height is randomly distributed among the population in the neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
