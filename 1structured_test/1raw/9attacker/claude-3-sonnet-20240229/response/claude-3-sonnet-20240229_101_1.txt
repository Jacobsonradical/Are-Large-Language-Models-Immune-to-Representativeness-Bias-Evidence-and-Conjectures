To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = 0.20 (the probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, based on the neighborhood's population distribution)

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.20
P(A|B) = 0.15

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
