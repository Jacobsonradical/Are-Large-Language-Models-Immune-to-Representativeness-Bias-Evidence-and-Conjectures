To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific than the city-wide statistics.

Given information:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
- The victim could not see the attacker's height.

Assuming that the attacker is from the same neighborhood and there is no additional information to suggest otherwise, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is equal to the proportion of people in that neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
