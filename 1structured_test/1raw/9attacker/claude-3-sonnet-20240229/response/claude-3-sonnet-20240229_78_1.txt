To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we do not have any additional information about the attacker, we can assume that the attacker is randomly drawn from the population in that neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
