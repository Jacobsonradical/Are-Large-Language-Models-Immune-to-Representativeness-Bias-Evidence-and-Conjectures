To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events based on the prior probabilities and the likelihood of observing the evidence given each hypothesis.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a higher proportion of tall people.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.2 (20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller, which is the likelihood of observing the evidence if the attacker is tall)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^C) * P(A^C), where A^C is the complement of A (the attacker's height is less than 185 cm)
  P(B|A^C) = 0.8 (80% of the neighborhood's population is shorter than 185 cm)
  P(A^C) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Substituting the values:
P(B) = (0.2 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.71

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.2 * 0.15) / 0.71
       = 0.0423 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0423}
