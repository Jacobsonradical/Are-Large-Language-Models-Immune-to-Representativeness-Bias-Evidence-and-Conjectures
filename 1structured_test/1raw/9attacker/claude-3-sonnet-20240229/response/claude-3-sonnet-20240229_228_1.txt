To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as this is more specific to the case than the general city population statistics.

Given information:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
