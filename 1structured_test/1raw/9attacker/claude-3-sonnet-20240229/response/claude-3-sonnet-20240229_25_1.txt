To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given:
- In the city, P(height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15
- In the neighborhood, P(height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.20

We want to find P(attacker's height ≥ 185 cm | attack occurred in the neighborhood).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(attacker's height ≥ 185 cm | attack occurred in the neighborhood) = (P(attack occurred in the neighborhood | attacker's height ≥ 185 cm) × P(attacker's height ≥ 185 cm)) / P(attack occurred in the neighborhood)

Since we don't have enough information to calculate P(attack occurred in the neighborhood | attacker's height ≥ 185 cm), we can assume that the attack is equally likely to occur in any neighborhood, regardless of the attacker's height. Therefore, P(attack occurred in the neighborhood | attacker's height ≥ 185 cm) = P(attack occurred in the neighborhood) = 1.

Substituting the known values, we get:
P(attacker's height ≥ 185 cm | attack occurred in the neighborhood) = (1 × 0.20) / P(attack occurred in the neighborhood)

Since we don't know the value of P(attack occurred in the neighborhood), we can normalize the result by dividing by the sum of the numerators for all possible cases:

P(attacker's height ≥ 185 cm | attack occurred in the neighborhood) = (0.20) / ((0.20) + (0.80 × 0.15))
P(attacker's height ≥ 185 cm | attack occurred in the neighborhood) = 0.20 / (0.20 + 0.12)
P(attacker's height ≥ 185 cm | attack occurred in the neighborhood) = 0.20 / 0.32
P(attacker's height ≥ 185 cm | attack occurred in the neighborhood) ≈ 0.625

{probability: 0.625}
