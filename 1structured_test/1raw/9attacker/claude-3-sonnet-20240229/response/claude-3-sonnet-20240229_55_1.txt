To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since it is more specific than the city-wide statistics.

Given information:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
