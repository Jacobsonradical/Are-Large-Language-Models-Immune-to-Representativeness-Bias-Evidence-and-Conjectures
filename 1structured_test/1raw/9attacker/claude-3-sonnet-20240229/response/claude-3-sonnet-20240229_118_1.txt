To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the given information about the population distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood, it is more relevant to use the neighborhood's population distribution rather than the city's overall distribution.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
