To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the given information about the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Since the attack happened in a specific neighborhood, and not in the entire city, we should use the height distribution of that neighborhood.

In the neighborhood where the attack occurred:
- 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm
- 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
