To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information given about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific to the location of the incident.

Given information:
- In the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
