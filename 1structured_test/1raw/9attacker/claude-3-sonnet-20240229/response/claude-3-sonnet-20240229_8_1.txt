To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since that is more specific to the situation.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since we don't have any additional information, we can assume that the attacker is from the same neighborhood population.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
