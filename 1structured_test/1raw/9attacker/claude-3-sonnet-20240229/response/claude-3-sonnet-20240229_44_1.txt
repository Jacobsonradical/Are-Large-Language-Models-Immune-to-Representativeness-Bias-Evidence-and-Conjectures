{probability: 0.2}

To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided about the population distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, as it is more specific to the location of the incident.

According to the given information, in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller. Since we do not have any other information to narrow down the suspect pool, we can assume that the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is the same as the percentage of people in that neighborhood with that height, which is 0.2 or 20%.
