To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since this is more specific than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
- The attacker is assumed to be from the same neighborhood.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2}
