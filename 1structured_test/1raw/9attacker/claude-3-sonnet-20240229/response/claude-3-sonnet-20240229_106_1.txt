To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information about the population heights in the city and the neighborhood where the attack occurred.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (20% of the people in the neighborhood where the attack occurred are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = 0.20 (assuming the neighborhood represents 20% of the city's population)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.20 × 0.15) / 0.20
        = 0.15

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
