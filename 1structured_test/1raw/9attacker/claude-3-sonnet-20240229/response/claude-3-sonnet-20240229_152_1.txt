To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (20% of the neighborhood population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = 0.20 (assuming the neighborhood represents 20% of the city population)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.20
P(A|B) = 0.15

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood, is 0.15.

{probability: 0.15}
