To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since that is more specific than the city-level data.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 80% of the people are shorter than 185 cm.
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attacker is from the neighborhood, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
