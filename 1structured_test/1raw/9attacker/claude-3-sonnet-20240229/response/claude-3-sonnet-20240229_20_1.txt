To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood with a specific height distribution

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a known height distribution.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.2 (20% of the neighborhood's population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.2 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.765 (Probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.2 * 0.15) / 0.765 = 0.0394 or approximately 0.04

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.04}
