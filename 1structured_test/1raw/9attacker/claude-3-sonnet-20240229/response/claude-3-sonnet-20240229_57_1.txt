To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a person's height is 185 cm or taller in the city)
- P(B|A) = 0.20 (probability that a person of height 185 cm or taller lives in the neighborhood)
- P(B) = ? (probability that the attack occurred in the neighborhood)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
where A' is the complementary event (height < 185 cm).

Assuming that P(B|A') = 0.80 (probability that a person shorter than 185 cm lives in the neighborhood), and P(A') = 0.85 (probability that a person's height is less than 185 cm in the city), we have:

P(B) = 0.20 * 0.15 + 0.80 * 0.85 = 0.71

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.71 = 0.0423 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0423}
