To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The attack occurred in the neighborhood where 20% of the population is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred in the neighborhood with a higher proportion of tall people.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 for the city population.
- P(B) is the probability of the attack occurring in the neighborhood, regardless of the attacker's height.

We can calculate P(B|A) as follows:
P(B|A) = 0.2 (since 20% of the people in the neighborhood are 185 cm or taller)

P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|¬A) × P(¬A)
     = 0.2 × 0.15 + P(B|¬A) × 0.85

We don't know P(B|¬A), but we can assign a reasonable value, such as 0.8 (assuming that if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the attack is equally likely to occur in any neighborhood).

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.2 × 0.15 + 0.8 × 0.85 = 0.71

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.2 × 0.15) / 0.71
       = 0.0422 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0422}
