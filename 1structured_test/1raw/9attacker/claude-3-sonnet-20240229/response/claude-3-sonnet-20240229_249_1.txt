To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since that is more specific than the city-wide statistics.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 20% of people are 185 cm or taller.
- We don't have any additional information about the attacker.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
