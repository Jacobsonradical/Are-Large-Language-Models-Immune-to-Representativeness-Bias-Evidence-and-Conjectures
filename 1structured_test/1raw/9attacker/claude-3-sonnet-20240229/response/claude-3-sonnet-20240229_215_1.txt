To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use the information provided about the height distribution in the neighborhood where the attack occurred, since this is more specific to the case.

Given:
- In the neighborhood, 20% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
- We don't have any additional information about the attacker.

Therefore, we can assume that the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2}
