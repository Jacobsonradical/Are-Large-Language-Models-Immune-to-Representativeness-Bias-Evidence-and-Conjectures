{hospital: 1}

The reasoning behind this answer is that hospital 1 has a higher daily average number of births (45 vs. 15). A larger sample size in hospital 1 will result in a more stable average percentage of baby boys, closer to 50%. In contrast, hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, which means the percentage of baby boys can fluctuate more widely from day to day. Consequently, hospital 2 will likely have more days with over 60% baby boys due to these fluctuations. However, the question asks for the hospital that recorded more such days, not the hospital with a higher proportion of such days. Given that hospital 1 has more births daily, even if the percentage of days with over 60% baby boys is slightly lower than in hospital 2, the absolute number of these days will still be higher in hospital 1. Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 1 recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
