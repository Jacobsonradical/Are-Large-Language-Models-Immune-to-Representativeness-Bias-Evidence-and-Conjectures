{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has more births per day (45) than Hospital 2 (15). Since the variation in the percentage of baby boys is the same for both hospitals, the hospital with more births will have a higher chance of having more days with over 60% of babies being boys due to the larger sample size. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
