Before providing a definitive answer, it's important to consider the variation in daily births and the percentage of male births. Since Hospital 1 has more daily births than Hospital 2, it would have a more stable distribution of male births due to the law of large numbers. This means that the percentage of male births in Hospital 1 should fluctuate less from the expected 50% compared to Hospital 2.

Since Hospital 2 has fewer daily births, it's more likely to have a larger variation in the percentage of male births. This means that Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

Therefore, I would answer 2: Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys. However, it's important to note that this is a statistical prediction and actual results may vary.
