{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). The larger number of daily births in Hospital 1 increases the likelihood of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. This is due to the Law of Large Numbers, which states that as the sample size increases, the actual proportion of successes (in this case, the proportion of male births) is likely to be closer to the expected proportion (50%). Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% male births.
