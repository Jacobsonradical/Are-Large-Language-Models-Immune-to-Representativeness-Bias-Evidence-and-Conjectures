{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Since hospital 1 has a larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies), the distribution of the percentage of baby boys will tend to be closer to the expected 50% due to the larger sample size. This means that the variation in the percentage of baby boys from day to day will be less pronounced in hospital 1. Therefore, it is less likely for hospital 1 to have days with more than 60% baby boys compared to hospital 2, which has a smaller daily birth rate. However, the question asks for the hospital that recorded more such days, not fewer. Since hospital 1 has more births per day, there will still be more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, even if the percentage is lower than that of hospital 2 on those days. This is due to the larger number of births, increasing the likelihood of having a higher number of boys, even if the percentage is lower than 60%.
