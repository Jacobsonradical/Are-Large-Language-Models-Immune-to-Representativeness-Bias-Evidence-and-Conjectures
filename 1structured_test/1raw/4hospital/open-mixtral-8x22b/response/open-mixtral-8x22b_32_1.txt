Based on the given information, I would predict that hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% of babies born being boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size reduces the variability in the percentage of baby boys from day to day, making it more likely for hospital 1 to have days where more than 60% of babies born are boys.

However, it's important to note that this is a prediction based on probability and the actual results could vary due to the random nature of birth outcomes.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
{hospital: 1}
