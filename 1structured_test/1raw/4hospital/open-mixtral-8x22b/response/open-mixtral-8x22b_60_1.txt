Based on the principle of probability and the law of large numbers, hospital 1, which has more births each day and thus a larger sample size, would be more likely to have a number of baby boys each day that is closer to the expected percentage of 50%. This means that the percentage of days where more than 60% of babies born are boys would likely be lower for hospital 1.

On the other hand, hospital 2, with fewer births each day, would have a smaller sample size and thus the percentage of baby boys each day would be more variable, meaning there would be more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

Therefore, my answer is: 2. Hospital 2 is likely to have recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
