{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1, with 45 births per day, is more likely to have days with more than 60% boys than Hospital 2, which has only 15 births per day. This is due to the law of large numbers, which states that as a sample size increases, the observed results will be closer to the expected results. With a larger number of births per day, Hospital 1 is more likely to see daily variations that are closer to the expected 50% of boys, and also more likely to see days with over 60% boys. In contrast, Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, and as a result, daily variations are more likely to be further from the expected 50%, making it less likely to see days with more than 60% boys.
