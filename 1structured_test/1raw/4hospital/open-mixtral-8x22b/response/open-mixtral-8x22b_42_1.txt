{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1, with an average of 45 babies born each day, will have a more stable and predictable distribution of baby boys to baby girls due to the larger sample size. This means that the percentage of baby boys born on any given day is less likely to deviate significantly from the expected 50%.

On the other hand, Hospital 2, with an average of only 15 babies born each day, will have a more variable distribution of baby boys to baby girls. This means that the percentage of baby boys born on any given day is more likely to deviate from the expected 50%, and could more easily surpass the 60% threshold. However, the smaller sample size also means that the opposite is true - the percentage of baby boys could also be much lower than 50%.

Given these considerations, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys than Hospital 2, as the larger sample size in Hospital 1 reduces the likelihood of extreme deviations from the expected percentage.
