{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). The larger number of daily births in Hospital 1 allows for greater statistical stability, making it more likely for the percentage of boys to fluctuate around 50% and less likely to deviate significantly from this average. Consequently, Hospital 1 is less likely to experience days with more than 60% of babies being boys.

However, Hospital 2 has a lower daily birth rate, which makes it more susceptible to larger fluctuations in the proportion of boys born each day. Therefore, it is more likely to have days with more than 60% of babies being boys.

In summary, due to the higher daily birth rate in Hospital 1, it is less likely to have days with more than 60% of babies being boys compared to Hospital 2. So, I think Hospital 1 recorded fewer such days.
