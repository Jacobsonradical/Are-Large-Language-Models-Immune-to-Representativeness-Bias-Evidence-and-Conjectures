{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate than Hospital 2, with about 45 babies born each day compared to Hospital 2's 15 babies. A larger sample size (number of babies born) means that the percentage of baby boys born each day will tend to be closer to the expected value of 50%. This is due to the law of large numbers in statistics. Therefore, it is less likely for Hospital 1 to have days with more than 60% boys than Hospital 2, which has a smaller sample size each day. However, since the number of days with more than 60% boys is not solely dependent on the daily birth rate but also on the variation in the percentage of baby boys from day to day, it is not guaranteed that Hospital 1 will record fewer such days. Nevertheless, based on the larger sample size and the law of large numbers, it is reasonable to expect that Hospital 1 would record fewer days with more than 60% boys compared to Hospital 2.
