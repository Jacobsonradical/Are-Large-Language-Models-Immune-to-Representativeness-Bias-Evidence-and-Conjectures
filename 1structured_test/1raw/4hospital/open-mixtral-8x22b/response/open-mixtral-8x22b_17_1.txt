{hospital: 1}

I believe hospital 1 recorded more such days. The reason is that larger sample sizes, like the 45 daily births in hospital 1, tend to produce distributions closer to the expected value (50% boys). However, when the percentage deviates from the expected value, it does so in a more pronounced way. So, while on any given day both hospitals might have more than 60% boys, hospital 1 is more likely to reach that threshold because of its larger sample size. This does not guarantee that hospital 1 will have more such days, but it makes it statistically more likely.
