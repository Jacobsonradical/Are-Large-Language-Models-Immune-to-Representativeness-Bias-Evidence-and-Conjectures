Hospital: 1

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate, which means that it generally has more babies born each day compared to Hospital 2. This larger sample size each day results in a more stable and consistent distribution of boys and girls born. Therefore, Hospital 1 would be more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, simply due to having more births each day. Hospital 2, with its lower daily birth rate, would likely experience greater variation in the percentage of boys and girls born each day due to its smaller sample size, but overall, it would still be less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys compared to Hospital 1.
