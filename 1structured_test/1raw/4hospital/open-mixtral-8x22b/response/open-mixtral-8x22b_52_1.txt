{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
The larger the sample size, the more likely it is to be closer to the expected distribution. Hospital 1, with 45 births per day, has a larger sample size than Hospital 2, with 15 births per day. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have a percentage of baby boys closer to 50% on any given day. Consequently, it would be less likely for Hospital 1 to have days with more than 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 2, which has a smaller sample size and thus is more likely to deviate further from the expected 50%. However, the question asks for more days with more than 60% baby boys, and the answer is counter-intuitive. Since Hospital 1 has a larger number of daily births, it also has a higher probability of having more days with more than 60% baby boys, even if the overall percentage of such days might be lower compared to Hospital 2. This is due to the larger sample size and the higher number of opportunities for the 60% threshold to be met.
