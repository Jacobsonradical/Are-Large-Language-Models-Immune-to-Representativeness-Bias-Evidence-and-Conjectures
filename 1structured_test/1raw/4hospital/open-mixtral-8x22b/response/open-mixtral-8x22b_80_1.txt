{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. Even though the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, the larger number of births in hospital 1 (45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 births per day) will result in a more stable distribution and a higher likelihood of days where more than 60% of babies born are boys. Additionally, the variability in the percentage of baby boys will have a smaller impact on the overall distribution in hospital 1 due to the larger sample size.
