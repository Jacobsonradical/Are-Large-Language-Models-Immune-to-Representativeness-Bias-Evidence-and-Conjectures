{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. While both hospitals have a random daily variation in the percentage of baby boys born, hospital 1 has a larger sample size each day (45 births versus 15 births in hospital 2). This larger sample size means that the daily percentage of baby boys is likely to be closer to the expected value of 50%, making it less likely for hospital 1 to have more than 60% baby boys on any given day. However, the larger sample size also means that any given deviation from the expected value will result in a larger absolute number of baby boys. So, even though hospital 1 may have fewer days with more than 60% baby boys, the total number of babies born on those days will likely be higher than in hospital 2, resulting in more recorded days with more than 60% baby boys.
