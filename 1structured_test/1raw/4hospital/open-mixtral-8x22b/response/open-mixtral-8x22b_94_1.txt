Based on the given information, hospital 1 would likely have recorded more days with more than 60% of babies born being boys. The reasoning is that hospital 1 has a larger sample size (about 45 babies/day) compared to hospital 2 (about 15 babies/day). A larger sample size would lead to more stable proportions and a greater likelihood of reaching extreme values, such as over 60% boys. Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 1}
