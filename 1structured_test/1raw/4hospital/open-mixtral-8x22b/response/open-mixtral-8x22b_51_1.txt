{hospital: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 records a higher number of births per day compared to Hospital 2. Due to the larger sample size in Hospital 1, the percentage of boys born on a given day is more likely to be closer to the expected value of 50%. This means that the proportion of days where more than 60% of babies born are boys is likely to be lower in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2.

However, the question asks which hospital is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys, not the proportion of such days. Since Hospital 1 has a larger number of births per day, it will have more days where the number of boys exceeds 60% simply due to the larger sample size.

Therefore, based on the information given, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys, even if the proportion of such days is lower in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2.
