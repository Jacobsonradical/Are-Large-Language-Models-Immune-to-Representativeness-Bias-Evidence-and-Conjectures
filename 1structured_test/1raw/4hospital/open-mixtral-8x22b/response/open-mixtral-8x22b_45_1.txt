{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day compared to Hospital 2 (45 vs 15). Due to the larger sample size in Hospital 1, the percentage of baby boys born is more likely to be closer to the expected 50% on any given day. Therefore, the proportion of days with more than 60% baby boys is expected to be lower in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2, which has a smaller sample size and higher variability. However, the question asks which hospital recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys. With the larger number of births per day in Hospital 1, there is a higher chance of having days where more than 60% of babies born are boys, simply because of the larger number of trials (births). Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more such days compared to Hospital 2.
