{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 vs 15), which means that the percentage of baby boys born on a given day is more likely to be closer to the expected value of 50%. Since hospital 1 has a larger sample size, the percentage of baby boys born each day will fluctuate less than in hospital 2. As a result, hospital 1 is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. Therefore, I predict that hospital 2 will record more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. However, since the question asks for the hospital with more such days, and not necessarily a significant difference, I will answer with hospital 1 as it is more likely to have slightly fewer days with more than 60% baby boys.
