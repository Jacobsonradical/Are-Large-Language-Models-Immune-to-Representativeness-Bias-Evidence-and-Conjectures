{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate, with 45 babies born each day, compared to Hospital 2's 15 babies. The larger the sample size (number of babies born), the closer the proportion of boys to girls will be to the expected value of 50%. Therefore, Hospital 1 is less likely to have days with more than 60% boys. However, due to the random nature of birth ratios, both hospitals will still have some days with more than 60% boys. Since Hospital 1 has a larger daily birth rate, it will have a larger total number of days with more than 60% boys, even though the proportion of such days to the total number of days will be smaller compared to Hospital 2.
