{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. The reasoning behind this is that hospital 1 has a much higher number of daily births compared to hospital 2. Given that the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, having a larger sample size (i.e., more daily births) increases the likelihood of encountering days with more than 60% of babies being boys.
