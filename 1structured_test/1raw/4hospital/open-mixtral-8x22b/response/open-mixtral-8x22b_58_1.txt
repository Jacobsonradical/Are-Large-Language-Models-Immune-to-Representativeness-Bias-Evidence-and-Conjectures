{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher total number of births per day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). The more babies born each day, the more likely it is for the percentage of baby boys to fluctuate and occasionally exceed 60%. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of baby boys.
