Based on the given information and statistical probability, it is more likely that hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% of babies born being boys. The larger the sample size, the closer the results will be to the expected outcome. Since hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born each day, it is more likely to have a higher number of days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. However, this is a probability, not a certainty, and the actual results could vary.
