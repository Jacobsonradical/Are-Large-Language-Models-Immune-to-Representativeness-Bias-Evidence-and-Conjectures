{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Since hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born each day (45 babies), it is more likely to have days with more than 60% of the babies being boys compared to hospital 2 (with 15 babies born each day). The larger sample size in hospital 1 allows for more variation and makes it more likely to reach the 60% threshold. Therefore, I believe hospital 1 recorded more such days.
