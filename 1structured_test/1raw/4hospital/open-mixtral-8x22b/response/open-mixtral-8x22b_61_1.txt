{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate than Hospital 2, with 45 births per day compared to 15 births per day. Since we are looking for days where more than 60% of babies born are boys, a larger sample size (number of births per day) will result in less variation and more stable proportions. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have a higher number of days where more than 60% of babies born are boys due to its larger daily birth rate, which leads to more stable proportions and less fluctuation around the 50% average.
