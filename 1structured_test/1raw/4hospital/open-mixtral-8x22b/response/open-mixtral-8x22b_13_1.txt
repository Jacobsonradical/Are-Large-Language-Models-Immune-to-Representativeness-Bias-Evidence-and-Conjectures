{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher average number of daily births (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). Due to the larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days with more than 60% boys born than Hospital 2. This is because larger sample sizes tend to be closer to the expected value (50% boys) and are less affected by random fluctuations. Therefore, Hospital 1 is expected to have more days with more than 60% boys born.
