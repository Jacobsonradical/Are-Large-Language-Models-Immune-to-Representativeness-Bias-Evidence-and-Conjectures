{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 births per day). A larger sample size reduces the effect of random variation and makes the proportion of boys closer to 50%. However, when the proportion of boys exceeds 60%, this larger sample size also means that the deviation from 50% is more likely to be a statistically significant event rather than a random fluctuation. Therefore, we would expect more days with a higher proportion of boys in the hospital with the larger number of births.
