{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). The larger sample size in hospital 1 means that it is more likely to have days with more than 60% boys, as the larger number of births makes it more likely to approach the expected value of 50% boys. The smaller sample size in hospital 2 makes it more susceptible to random variation and less likely to have days with more than 60% boys. Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 1 recorded more such days.
