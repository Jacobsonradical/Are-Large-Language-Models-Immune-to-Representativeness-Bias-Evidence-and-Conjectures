{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 births per day). The larger sample size means that Hospital 1's daily percentage of baby boys born is more likely to be close to the expected percentage (50%). Consequently, days with more than 60% of babies born being boys would be less frequent in Hospital 1 than in Hospital 2, where the smaller sample size can result in larger fluctuations in daily percentages. However, since the question asks for the hospital that recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys, it is important to note that even though Hospital 1 has fewer such days proportionally, the absolute number of such days might still be higher due to its larger daily birth rate. Therefore, the answer is Hospital 1.
