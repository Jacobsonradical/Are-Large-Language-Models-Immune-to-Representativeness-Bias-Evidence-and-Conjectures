{hospital: 1}

The reason for choosing hospital 1 is because it has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 babies in hospital 1 vs. 15 babies in hospital 2). A larger sample size reduces the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day and makes the percentage more likely to be closer to the expected value of 50%. Therefore, it is less likely for hospital 1 to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, compared to hospital 2. However, since the question asks for the hospital that recorded more such days, and we are looking for a difference within 5%, it is still possible that hospital 1 could have more days with more than 60% of babies being boys, due to the larger sample size.
