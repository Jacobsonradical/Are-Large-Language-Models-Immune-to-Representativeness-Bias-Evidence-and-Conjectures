{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 vs 15), so the percentage of baby boys is more likely to be closer to the expected value of 50%. This means that the number of days where more than 60% of babies born are boys is likely to be lower in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2. However, due to the larger sample size, the variation in the percentage of baby boys from day to day is also likely to be smaller. This means that on the days when more than 60% of babies born are boys, the difference between the actual percentage and the expected value of 50% is likely to be larger in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2. Therefore, Hospital 1 is likely to have more days with more than 60% of babies born being boys.
