Based on the given information, I would say that hospital 1 recorded more such days. The reason is that hospital 1 has a higher number of births each day, which makes the percentage of baby boys more stable and closer to the expected value of 50%. This means that the percentage of baby boys would need to deviate more from the expected value to reach 60% in hospital 1 compared to hospital 2. However, since hospital 1 has more births, the probability of this happening is higher compared to hospital 2.

So my answer is: {hospital: 1}
