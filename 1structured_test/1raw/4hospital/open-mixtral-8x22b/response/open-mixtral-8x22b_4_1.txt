{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day, which means it has a larger sample size for each day. A larger sample size reduces the effect of random variation, making the percentage of baby boys each day more likely to be close to the overall average of 50%. However, this also means that when the percentage of baby boys deviates from the average, it will deviate by a larger number due to the higher birth rate.

Hospital 2, on the other hand, has a smaller sample size, which means that random variation will have a greater effect on the daily percentage of baby boys. This can result in a higher number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, but it can also result in a higher number of days where less than 40% of the babies born are boys.

Given these factors, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because, while the daily percentage of baby boys is likely to be closer to the average due to the larger sample size, the higher birth rate means that when the percentage does deviate from the average, it will deviate by a larger number. This increases the likelihood of having days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.
