Based on the given information, we can use statistical reasoning to make an educated guess.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). This means that Hospital 1 would have a more stable distribution of the percentage of baby boys born each day, while Hospital 2 would have a more variable distribution due to its smaller sample size. In other words, the percentage of baby boys in Hospital 2 would fluctuate more widely from day to day compared to Hospital 1.

With a higher variability, it's more likely that Hospital 2 would have more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%. However, it's also important to consider that Hospital 1 has a higher baseline number of babies born each day, so even though the percentage might fluctuate less, the total number of days where more than 60% of the babies are boys could still potentially be higher than in Hospital 2.

Given these considerations, it's a close call and it's difficult to definitively say which hospital would have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys. However, considering the balance between sample size and variability, my best guess would be that Hospital 2 might have recorded more such days.

Therefore, my answer would be:
{hospital: 2}

But please note that this is a statistical guess, and the actual numbers could vary due to the randomness of the events. It's also important to remember that this does not imply that there is a higher chance of having a boy in either hospital, as the sex of a baby is not influenced by the hospital in which it is born.
