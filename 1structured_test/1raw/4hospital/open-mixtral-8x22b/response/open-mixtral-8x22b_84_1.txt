{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. The reasoning behind this is that hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2. This means that the fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys will be less extreme in hospital 1, making it more likely for the percentage of baby boys to be closer to the expected value of 50%. Consequently, it would be less likely for hospital 1 to have days with more than 60% baby boys. However, due to the larger sample size, the few instances where the percentage of baby boys does exceed 60% in hospital 1 will still be greater in number than the instances in hospital 2, which has a smaller sample size and thus experiences more extreme fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys.
