{hospital: 1}

The reasoning behind this is that hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2 (45 vs. 15). A larger sample size reduces the variability in the percentage of baby boys from day to day, which means that the percentage of baby boys is more likely to be closer to the expected value of 50%. Therefore, it would be less likely for hospital 1 to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, compared to hospital 2, which has a smaller sample size and more variability. However, this effect might not be enough to compensate for the larger number of births in hospital 1, which would still result in more days with more than 60% boys than hospital 2.
