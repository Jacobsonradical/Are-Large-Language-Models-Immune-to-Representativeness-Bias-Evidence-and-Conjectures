My answer would be 1, indicating that I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. This is because hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day, leading to a larger sample size. A larger sample size reduces the variability in the proportion of boys born each day, making it more likely for the percentage to be closer to the overall average of 50%. However, having a larger sample size also means that the number of days where more than 60% of babies born are boys can be higher due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, I believe hospital 1 would have more days with over 60% of babies being boys.
