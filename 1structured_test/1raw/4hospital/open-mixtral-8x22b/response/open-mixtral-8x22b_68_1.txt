{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. The reasoning behind this is that hospital 1 has a larger sample size of daily births (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies). A larger sample size would generally lead to results that are closer to the expected percentage (50%). However, due to daily fluctuations, there will be days when the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%. With a larger sample size, these fluctuations are likely to happen less often but would still occur more frequently than in a smaller sample size. Therefore, I think hospital 1 would have recorded more days with over 60% boys due to having a larger sample size, despite the percentage of boys born being closer to 50% on average.
