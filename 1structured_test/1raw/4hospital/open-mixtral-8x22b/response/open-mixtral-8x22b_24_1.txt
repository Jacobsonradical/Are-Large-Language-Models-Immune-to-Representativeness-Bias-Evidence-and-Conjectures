{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher number of daily births compared to Hospital 2. The larger the number of daily births, the more likely the percentage of baby boys will be closer to 50%. This is due to the law of large numbers, which states that as a sample size grows, its mean will get closer to the average of the whole population.

In this case, Hospital 1 sees about 45 births per day, while Hospital 2 sees about 15. The larger sample size of Hospital 1 makes it less likely to deviate significantly from the average (50% boys), so it would have fewer days with more than 60% boys compared to Hospital 2. However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic reasoning, and actual results may vary due to randomness and other factors not considered in this explanation.
