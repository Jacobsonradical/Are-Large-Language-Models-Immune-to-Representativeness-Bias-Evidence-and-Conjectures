{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate, with about 45 babies born each day compared to 15 babies in Hospital 2. Due to the larger sample size in Hospital 1, the percentage of baby boys born on a given day will be closer to the expected value of 50%, resulting in less daily variation.

In Hospital 2, the smaller number of daily births means that the actual percentage of baby boys born could deviate more significantly from the expected value of 50%, making it more likely to see days with more than 60% baby boys. However, the smaller sample size also means that these deviations will be less frequent overall.

Therefore, even though Hospital 2 may have a higher percentage of days with more than 60% baby boys, the absolute number of such days will be lower due to the smaller daily birth rate. Hospital 1, with its larger daily birth rate, will have more days with more than 60% baby boys in absolute terms, despite the lower percentage of such days.
