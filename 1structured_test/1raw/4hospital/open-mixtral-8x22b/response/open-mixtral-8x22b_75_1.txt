{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Since hospital 1 has a higher number of babies born each day, it is more likely to have days with more than 60% of the babies being boys. This is due to the larger sample size of births in hospital 1, which reduces the impact of random fluctuations and makes it more likely for the percentage of boys to be closer to the expected value of 50%. However, it is also important to note that the actual number of days recorded for each hospital would depend on the specific daily variations in the gender ratio. In general, though, hospital 1 would be expected to have more such days due to its larger sample size.
