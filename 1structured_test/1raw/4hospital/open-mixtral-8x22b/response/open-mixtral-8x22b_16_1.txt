{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
The hospital with more births per day (hospital 1) would be more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. This is because larger sample sizes are more likely to reflect the true population proportion and less likely to have extreme variation. In this case, the larger number of daily births in hospital 1 means that it is less likely to have extreme variation from the 50% average compared to hospital 2. Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to have more days with more than 60% boys.
