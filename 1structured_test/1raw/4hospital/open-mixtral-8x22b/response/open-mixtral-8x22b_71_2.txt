{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. The reasoning behind this is that hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2. Due to the larger sample size, hospital 1 is more likely to see days with more than 60% boys, even though the overall percentage of boys is around 50%. The larger the sample size, the more likely it is to observe outcomes that deviate from the expected percentage.
