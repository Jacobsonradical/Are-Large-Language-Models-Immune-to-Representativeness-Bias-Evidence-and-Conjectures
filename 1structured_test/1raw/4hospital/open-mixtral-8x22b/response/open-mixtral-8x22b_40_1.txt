Based on the given information, I would think that hospital 1 recorded more such days. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size of births each day, which would make it more likely to approach the expected percentage of 50% on any given day. Consequently, deviations from this percentage, such as having more than 60% boys, would also be more frequent. However, the exact numbers would depend on the actual distribution of births, which is not provided in the question.
