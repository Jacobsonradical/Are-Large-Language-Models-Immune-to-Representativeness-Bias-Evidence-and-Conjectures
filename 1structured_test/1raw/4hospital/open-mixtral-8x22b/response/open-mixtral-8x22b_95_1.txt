{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of births each day (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). Due to the larger sample size, the percentage of baby boys born on a given day in Hospital 1 will be more likely to stabilize around the expected value of 50%, resulting in fewer days where the percentage exceeds 60%. However, because Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, the percentage of baby boys born on a given day can fluctuate more widely, leading to a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys is more than 60%. This phenomenon is known as the law of large numbers.

Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys being born. However, the question asks for the hospital that is expected to record fewer such days, which would be Hospital 1. Keep in mind that this is a probabilistic answer, and actual results may vary due to the randomness inherent in birth gender distributions.
