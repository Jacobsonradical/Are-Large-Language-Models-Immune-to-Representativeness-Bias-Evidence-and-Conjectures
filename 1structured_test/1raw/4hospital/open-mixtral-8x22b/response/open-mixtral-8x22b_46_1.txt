{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Since hospital 1 has a higher number of daily births (45 vs 15), the sample size is larger, making the percentage of baby boys on any given day more likely to be closer to the expected 50%. On the other hand, hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, making the percentage of baby boys more variable and more likely to exceed 60% on certain days. However, due to the larger sample size in hospital 1, the overall number of days with more than 60% boys is likely to be higher than in hospital 2, even though the percentage might be more variable in hospital 2.
