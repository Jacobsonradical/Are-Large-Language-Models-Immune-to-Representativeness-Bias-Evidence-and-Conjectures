{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1, with 45 births per day, is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys because the larger sample size (number of births) means that the actual percentage of boys born on a given day is more likely to be closer to 50%. This reduces the variability in the proportion of boys born each day, making it less likely for the percentage of boys to exceed 60% due to random fluctuations.

On the other hand, Hospital 2, with only 15 births per day, has a smaller sample size, which leads to more variability in the proportion of boys born each day. This means that, although the expected percentage of boys is still 50%, there is a higher chance of observing days with more than 60% boys due to random fluctuations. However, this also means that there is a higher chance of observing days with less than 40% boys.

Considering these factors, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys, as the larger sample size reduces variability and makes the observed percentage closer to the expected percentage.
