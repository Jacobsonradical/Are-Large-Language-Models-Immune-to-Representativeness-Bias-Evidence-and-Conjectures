{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). Due to the larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys is close to the expected value of 50%. Therefore, the variation from this expected value (such as exceeding 60%) will also be more frequent in Hospital 1. This means that Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
