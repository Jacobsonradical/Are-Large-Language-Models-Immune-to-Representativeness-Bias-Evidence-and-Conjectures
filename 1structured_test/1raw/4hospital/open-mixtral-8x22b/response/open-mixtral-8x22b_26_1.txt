{hospital: 1}

The reasoning behind this answer is that hospital 1 has a larger sample size of births each day compared to hospital 2. Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, simply due to the larger number of daily births. This larger sample size makes it more likely for hospital 1 to approach and exceed the 60% threshold, even if the actual percentage of baby boys is close to 50%.
