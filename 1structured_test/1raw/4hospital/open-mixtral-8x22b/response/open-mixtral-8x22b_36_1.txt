{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size of babies born each day. With a larger sample size, the proportion of baby boys born each day is more likely to be closer to the overall average of 50%. Therefore, it is less likely for hospital 1 to have days where more than 60% of babies born are boys, making it more noteworthy when it does occur. In contrast, hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, making it more prone to fluctuations in the proportion of baby boys born each day. This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of babies born are boys, but these occurrences are less noteworthy due to the smaller sample size. However, the exact number of such days would depend on the specific distribution of baby boys born in each hospital, which is not provided in the question.
