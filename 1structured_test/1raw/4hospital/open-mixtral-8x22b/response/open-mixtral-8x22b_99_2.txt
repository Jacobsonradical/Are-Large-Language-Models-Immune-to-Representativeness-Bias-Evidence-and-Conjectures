{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size of births each day. A larger sample size means that the daily percentage of boys born will tend to be closer to the expected percentage (50%). However, larger sample sizes also have more variability, which means that the percentage of boys born can fluctuate more widely from day to day. Since hospital 1 has a larger sample size than hospital 2, it is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born is greater than 60%.
