{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of births each day compared to Hospital 2. This means that Hospital 1 will have more days with more than 60% of babies being boys due to the larger number of daily births, which increases the chances of having a higher percentage of boys on a given day.

On the other hand, Hospital 2, with only 15 births per day, will have fewer days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. This is because a smaller sample size makes it less likely to have a high percentage of boys, as the variation in daily percentages will be more pronounced.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% of babies being boys compared to Hospital 2.
