{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher birth rate (45 babies per day) than Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). This means that Hospital 1 has a larger sample size each day, which generally leads to results that are closer to the expected value (around 50% boys). However, a larger sample size also means that Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys is significantly higher than 50%. Therefore, it's more probable that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys.
