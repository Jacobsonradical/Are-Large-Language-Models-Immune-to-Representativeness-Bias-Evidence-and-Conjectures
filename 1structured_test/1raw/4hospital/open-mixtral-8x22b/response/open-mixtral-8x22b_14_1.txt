Given that the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day and sometimes may be higher than 50%, let's consider the probabilities for each hospital.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45), while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size (15). The larger the sample size, the more likely it is to be closer to the expected value (50% boys). Therefore, it is less likely for Hospital 1 to have more than 60% boys on any given day compared to Hospital 2.

Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have a higher variance in the percentage of baby boys, making it more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

However, the question asks if the hospitals recorded "more such days" or if they are "about the same (within 5% of each other)" over a period of 1 year. Considering the larger sample size of Hospital 1, the percentage of days with more than 60% boys should still be relatively low compared to Hospital 2, but Hospital 1 will have more of these days simply because it has more babies born daily.

To determine if the hospitals are "about the same" (within 5% of each other) in terms of the number of days with more than 60% boys, we would need to know the exact probabilities for each hospital, which is not provided. However, given the information available, it is reasonable to assume that Hospital 1 will have more of these days due to the larger number of daily births, but the difference may not be significant enough to conclude that they are not "about the same" (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, I would lean towards thinking that the hospitals are "about the same" (within 5% of each other) in terms of the number of days with more than 60% boys, but I acknowledge that this is not a definitive answer due to the lack of specific probability data.

{hospital: 3 - about the same (within 5% of each other)}
