Based on the given information, I would choose 1, indicating that hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys. The reasoning for this is that hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies). Due to the larger sample size, hospital 1 is more likely to have days with a higher percentage of baby boys. This is because larger sample sizes tend to be closer to the expected value (50% boys), and thus the variation from the expected value (60% boys) would be more likely to occur in hospital 1.

So the answer would be:
{hospital: 1}
