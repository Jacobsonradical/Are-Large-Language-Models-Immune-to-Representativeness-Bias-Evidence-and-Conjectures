{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher daily number of births compared to hospital 2 (45 vs. 15). The larger the number of daily births, the smaller the impact of random fluctuations on the ratio of boy to girl births. Thus, hospital 1 would be less likely to see days with more than 60% boys, simply due to having more births each day. This means that hospital 1 might have fewer days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys. However, if we consider the absolute number of days instead of the ratio, hospital 1 would still likely have recorded more such days because it has more daily births. Therefore, it's more probable that hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys.
