{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
The hospital with the larger number of daily births is more likely to experience a higher variance in the percentage of boys born each day. Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 1, with 45 daily births, will record more days with more than 60% of babies being boys than hospital 2, with only 15 daily births.
