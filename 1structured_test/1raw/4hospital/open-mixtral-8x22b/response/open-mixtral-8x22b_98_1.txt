{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
The hospital with the higher number of daily births (Hospital 1, with 45 births per day) is more likely to have days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys. This is due to the law of large numbers, which states that as the sample size increases, the observed results become closer to the expected results. In this case, the expected result is 50% boys, but Hospital 1 has more daily births, making it more likely to approach or exceed the 60% threshold on certain days.
