{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Since Hospital 1 has a larger number of daily births (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15), the variation in the percentage of baby boys will be less pronounced in Hospital 1 due to the larger sample size. This means that it is less likely for Hospital 1 to have more than 60% baby boys on any given day, as the larger number of births will tend to gravitate towards the expected value of 50%. Conversely, Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, will have more fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys, making it more likely to have days with more than 60% baby boys.

However, the question asks which hospital is more likely to have recorded more such days, not which hospital has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day. Since Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate, it will have more opportunities to record days with more than 60% baby boys, despite the lower probability on any given day. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more such days over the course of a year, even though Hospital 2 may have a higher percentage of these days relative to its total number of births.
