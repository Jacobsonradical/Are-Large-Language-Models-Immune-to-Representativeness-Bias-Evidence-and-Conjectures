{hospital: 1}

My reasoning is that since hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born each day (45 vs 15), the larger sample size would make it more likely to experience days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. This is due to the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem, which state that as sample size increases, the distribution of the sample means will approach a normal distribution with a mean equal to the population mean. Thus, the larger sample size at hospital 1 would make it more likely to see days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the mean of 50%.
