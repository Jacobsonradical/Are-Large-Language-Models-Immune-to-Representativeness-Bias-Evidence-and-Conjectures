{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day, which makes the sample size larger than that of Hospital 2. A larger sample size generally leads to results that are closer to the expected value (50% boys). However, this also means that there is more room for variation due to the larger number of births, leading to a higher probability of having days with more than 60% boys.

On the other hand, Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, which means that the results may deviate more from the expected value. However, the smaller sample size also means that there is less room for variation, making it less likely to have days with more than 60% boys.

Considering the above, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys than Hospital 2. However, this is a probabilistic statement and not a guarantee, as the actual number of days recorded by each hospital would depend on the specific sequence of births in each hospital.
