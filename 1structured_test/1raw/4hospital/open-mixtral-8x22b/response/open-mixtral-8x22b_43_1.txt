{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a larger number of daily births (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). This means that Hospital 1 has a larger sample size for each day. A larger sample size reduces the effect of random fluctuations and makes the percentage of baby boys closer to the expected value of 50%. Therefore, it's less likely for Hospital 1 to have days with more than 60% baby boys, but since Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, it's more likely to have days with more than 60% baby boys due to random fluctuations. However, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys decreases as the sample size increases, so Hospital 1 will still have more such days than Hospital 2, but the percentage of such days will be smaller.
