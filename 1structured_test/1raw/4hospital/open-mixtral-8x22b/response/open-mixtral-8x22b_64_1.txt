{hospital: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 sees more births per day (45 vs. 15 in Hospital 2), which means it has a larger sample size each day. A larger sample size leads to results that are more likely to be close to the expected value (50% boys), and therefore, it is less likely for Hospital 1 to have a day where more than 60% of babies are boys. However, given the significant difference in daily births, Hospital 1 might still have more days where more than 60% of babies are boys simply because it has more opportunities for such a scenario to occur. Additionally, having a larger sample size also means that the results are more stable, and the percentage of boys is less likely to fluctuate widely. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
