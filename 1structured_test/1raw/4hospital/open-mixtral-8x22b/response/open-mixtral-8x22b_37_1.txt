{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. The reason is that hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 babies vs 15 babies in hospital 2). A larger sample size reduces the effect of random variation and makes the actual percentage of baby boys more likely to align with the expected percentage (50%). Therefore, it would be less likely for hospital 1 to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to chance alone. However, since hospital 1 has more daily births, it will still have more days with more than 60% boys than hospital 2, even if the percentage of such days is lower.
