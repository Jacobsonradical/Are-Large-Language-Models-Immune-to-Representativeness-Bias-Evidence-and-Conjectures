{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). The larger number of daily births in Hospital 1 increases the likelihood of deviations from the expected 50% boy-girl ratio. This means that Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. Therefore, it is expected that Hospital 1 would record more such days compared to Hospital 2.
