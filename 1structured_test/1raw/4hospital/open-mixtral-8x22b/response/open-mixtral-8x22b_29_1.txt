{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size each day (45 babies compared to 15 babies in hospital 2), which reduces the impact of daily variation and makes the distribution of outcomes closer to the expected value. Therefore, the percentage of days with more than 60% baby boys is likely to be higher in hospital 1. However, this is a statistical estimate and the actual results may vary.
