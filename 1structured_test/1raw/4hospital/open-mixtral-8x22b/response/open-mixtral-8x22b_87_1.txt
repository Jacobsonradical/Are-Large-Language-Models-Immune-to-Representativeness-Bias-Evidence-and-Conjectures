{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
The hospital with more daily births (Hospital 1) is more likely to have days with more than 60% of babies being boys. This is because the larger number of daily births allows for a more representative sample of the population, making it more likely to approach the expected proportion of 50%. Additionally, due to the larger number of births, there will be more days where the percentage of boys deviates more from 50% than in Hospital 2 with fewer daily births.
