{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher number of daily births (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). Due to the larger sample size, Hospital 1 is likely to have a more stable distribution of baby boys and girls, approaching the expected 50%. However, this also means that fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys can affect a larger number of babies in Hospital 1. Since the question asks for days when more than 60% of babies born were boys, the hospital with a larger daily birth rate is more likely to experience these fluctuations, making it more probable that Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
