{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a larger number of daily births (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). The larger the sample size, the more likely it is to be close to the expected value (in this case, 50% of births being boys). However, the probability of having a day with more than 60% of babies being boys is higher in Hospital 1 due to the larger sample size. This is because a larger sample size allows for more variability in the daily percentage of baby boys. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% of babies being boys.
