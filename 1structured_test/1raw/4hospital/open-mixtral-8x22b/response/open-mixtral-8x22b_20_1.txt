{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. This is because hospital 1 has a higher number of daily births, which reduces the variability in the proportion of baby boys born each day. This means that hospital 1 is more likely to have days with more than 60% baby boys, simply due to the larger sample size.
