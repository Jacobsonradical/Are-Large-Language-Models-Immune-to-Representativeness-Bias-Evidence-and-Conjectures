{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Since hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day, it is more likely to have a day with more than 60% of babies born being boys than hospital 2, which has a smaller number of births per day. The larger number of births in hospital 1 allows for a greater chance of deviation from the average 50% ratio of baby boys to baby girls, making it more likely for the hospital to have days with a higher percentage of baby boys.
