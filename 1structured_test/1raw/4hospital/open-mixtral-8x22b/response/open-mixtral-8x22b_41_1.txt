{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2. The larger sample size reduces the chance of random fluctuations causing more than 60% of babies to be boys. Therefore, the days on which more than 60% of babies born are boys in hospital 1 are more likely to be due to actual deviations from the expected 50% split, rather than random chance.
