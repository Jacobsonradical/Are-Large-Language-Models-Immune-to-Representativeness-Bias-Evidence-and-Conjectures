{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day, which makes the percentage of baby boys more stable and closer to the expected value of 50%. In contrast, Hospital 2 has fewer births per day, making the percentage of baby boys more variable and more likely to deviate significantly from the expected value. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 will have fewer days with more than 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 2.
