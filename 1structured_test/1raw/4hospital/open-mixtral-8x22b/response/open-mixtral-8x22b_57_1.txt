{hospital: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of births each day compared to hospital 2 (45 vs 15). Due to the larger sample size, hospital 1 is more likely to have a distribution of births that is closer to the expected 50% of boys, and thus have fewer days with more than 60% boys. Conversely, hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have days with a larger deviation from the expected 50%, and thus more days with more than 60% boys. However, the question asks for an answer based on the given information, which does not provide enough detail to make a definitive conclusion. Therefore, based on the general principle that larger sample sizes tend to produce results closer to the expected value, I would guess that hospital 1 recorded fewer such days.
