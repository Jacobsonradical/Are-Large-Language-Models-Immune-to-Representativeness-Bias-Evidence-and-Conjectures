{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. The reasoning behind this is that hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day, which means that the percentage of baby boys born on a given day is more likely to approach the expected value of 50%. Conversely, hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, which means that the percentage of baby boys born on a given day is more likely to deviate from the expected value. Therefore, it is more probable that hospital 1 will have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, simply due to the larger sample size and the law of large numbers.
