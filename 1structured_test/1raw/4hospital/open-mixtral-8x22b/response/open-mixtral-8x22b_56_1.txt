{hospital: 1}

Explanation:

The hospital with a higher number of daily births is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of babies born being boys. This is due to the law of large numbers, which states that as the sample size increases, the observed results become closer to the true population value.

In this case, Hospital 1 has about 45 births per day, while Hospital 2 has about 15 births per day. The larger number of births in Hospital 1 increases the likelihood of observing days with more than 60% of babies being boys. This is because the larger sample size reduces the impact of random variation and makes the observed proportion of baby boys more stable and closer to the expected value of 50%.

Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% of babies born being boys than Hospital 2.
