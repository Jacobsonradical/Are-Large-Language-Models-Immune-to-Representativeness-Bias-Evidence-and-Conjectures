{hospital: 1}

Explanation: Although the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, Hospital 1 has a larger number of daily births. This means that Hospital 1 will have a larger sample size each day, making it more likely that the percentage of baby boys on any given day will be closer to the expected value of 50%. In a smaller sample size, such as in Hospital 2, the percentage of baby boys is more likely to fluctuate due to random chance. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 will have fewer days where the percentage of baby boys is more than 60%.
