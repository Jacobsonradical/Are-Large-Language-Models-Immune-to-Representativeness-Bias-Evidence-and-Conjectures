{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day with 45 babies, compared to Hospital 2 with 15 babies. Due to the larger sample size in Hospital 1, the number of days with more than 60% baby boys is likely to be higher than in Hospital 2. This is because larger sample sizes are less likely to deviate from the expected mean (50% boys) due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, it is more probable for the percentage of baby boys to exceed 60% on a given day in Hospital 1 than in Hospital 2.
