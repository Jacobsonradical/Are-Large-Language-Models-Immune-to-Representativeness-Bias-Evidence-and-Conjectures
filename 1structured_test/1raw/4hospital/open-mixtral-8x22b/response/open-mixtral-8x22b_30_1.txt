{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
The hospital with more births per day (Hospital 1, with 45 births) is more likely to record days with more than 60% boys than the hospital with fewer births per day (Hospital 2, with 15 births). This is because as the sample size increases, the actual percentage of boys will tend to be closer to the expected value (50%). Therefore, with a larger sample size, the percentage of boys will be less likely to deviate from 50% by more than 10%. Conversely, with a smaller sample size, the percentage of boys is more likely to deviate from 50% by more than 10%. Thus, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys than Hospital 2.
