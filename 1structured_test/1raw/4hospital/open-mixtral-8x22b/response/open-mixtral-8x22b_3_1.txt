{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2. As a result, hospital 1 is more likely to experience days with more than 60% of babies born being boys, simply due to the larger number of babies being born there. The larger sample size also means that fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys from day to day will be less pronounced in hospital 1 compared to hospital 2. This further increases the likelihood that hospital 1 will record more days with more than 60% of babies born being boys.
