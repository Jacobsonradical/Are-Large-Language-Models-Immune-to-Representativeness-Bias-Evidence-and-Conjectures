{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of daily births (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). This means that Hospital 1 is more likely to have a higher percentage of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to the larger sample size.

In statistics, larger sample sizes tend to produce results that are closer to the true population parameter. In this case, the larger sample size of Hospital 1 makes it more likely to have a higher frequency of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, compared to Hospital 2.
