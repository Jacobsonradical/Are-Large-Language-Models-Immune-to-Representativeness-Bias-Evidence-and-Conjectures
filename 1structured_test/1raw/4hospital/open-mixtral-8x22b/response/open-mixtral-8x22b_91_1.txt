{hospital: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1, with an average of 45 births per day, would have a more stable and predictable distribution of births due to the larger sample size, as compared to Hospital 2, which has an average of 15 births per day. The larger number of daily births in Hospital 1 means that the percentage of boys born would be closer to the expected 50% on most days, with less variation.

Conversely, Hospital 2's smaller number of daily births would result in a greater fluctuation in the percentage of boys born from day to day. This means that Hospital 2 would be more likely to have days with more than 60% boys, but also more likely to have days with fewer than 40% boys.

However, considering the law of large numbers, Hospital 1 would still be more likely to have more days with over 60% boys, because even though the percentage may not vary as much, the sheer number of births would result in more instances where the number of boys exceeds 60%.

Therefore, my answer is Hospital 1.
