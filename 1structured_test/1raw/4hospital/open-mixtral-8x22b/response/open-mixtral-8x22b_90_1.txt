{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. The reasoning behind this is that hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). This means that hospital 1 is more likely to see larger fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys, making it more probable for them to have days with more than 60% of babies being boys. However, keep in mind that this is a probabilistic reasoning, and in reality, there could be variability in the results.
