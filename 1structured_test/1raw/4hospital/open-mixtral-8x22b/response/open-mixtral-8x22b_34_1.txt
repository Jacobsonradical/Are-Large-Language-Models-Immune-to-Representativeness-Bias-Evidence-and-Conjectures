{hospital: 1}

Explanation: The variance in the percentage of baby boys from day to day is likely to be less in Hospital 1 due to the larger number of births per day (45 births vs 15 births in Hospital 2). This means that in Hospital 1, the percentage of baby boys is more likely to be closer to the expected 50%. Therefore, it is less probable for Hospital 1 to have days where more than 60% of babies are boys compared to Hospital 2. However, since Hospital 1 has more births, the likelihood of having days with more than 60% boys increases simply due to the larger number of observations, making it more probable that Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
