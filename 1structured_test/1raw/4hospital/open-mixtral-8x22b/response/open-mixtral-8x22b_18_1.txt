{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 records a higher number of daily births than Hospital 2 (45 vs 15). A larger sample size reduces variability and makes the observed percentage of baby boys closer to the expected percentage of 50%. Therefore, Hospital 1 is less likely to observe days with more than 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 2. However, this does not mean that Hospital 1 will have fewer such days. Since Hospital 1 has more daily births, it will still have a higher absolute number of days with more than 60% baby boys.

However, if the question is asking for a proportion of such days to the total number of days in a year, it might be more likely for Hospital 2 to record a higher proportion due to its smaller sample size and higher variability. But the question seems to be asking for the absolute number of days, not the proportion. Therefore, the answer is Hospital 1.
