Given the information, we can make an educated guess based on the principles of probability and statistics. However, it's important to note that the actual number of days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys can vary due to randomness and the natural fluctuations in birth rates.

Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). The larger the sample size (in this case, the number of daily births), the more likely it is to approximate the expected value, which is 50% boys. However, this also means there is a larger potential range for daily variation.

Hospital 2, with a lower daily birth rate, will have a smaller potential range for daily variation. However, because the sample size is smaller, it may deviate more frequently from the expected value of 50%.

Considering these factors, it is more likely that Hospital 1 will have more days with more than 60% boys simply because they have a larger daily sample size, which makes it more probable that they will reach the 60% threshold on more days than Hospital 2.

That being said, this is a statistical estimation and the actual results could differ due to the randomness of birth rates.

So, I would guess that Hospital 1 recorded more such days.

Answer: {hospital: 1}
