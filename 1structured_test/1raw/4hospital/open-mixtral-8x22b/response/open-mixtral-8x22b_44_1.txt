{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. The larger the sample size (number of babies born), the closer the proportion of boys to girls will be to 50%. Since hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies), the proportion of days where more than 60% of babies born are boys would generally be lower in hospital 1. However, it is still more likely for a deviation from the 50% mark to occur in hospital 1 due to the larger number of births, making it more probable that hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys.
