{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. This is because hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day compared to hospital 2. A larger sample size would generally result in the distribution being closer to the expected value (50% boys), and thus the chances of having more than 60% boys in a day would also be higher. However, it's important to note that this is a statistical prediction and actual results may vary due to the random nature of birth rates.
