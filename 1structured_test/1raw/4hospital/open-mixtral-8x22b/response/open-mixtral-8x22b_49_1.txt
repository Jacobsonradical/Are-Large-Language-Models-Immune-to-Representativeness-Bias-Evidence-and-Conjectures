{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. The reasoning behind this is that hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 compared to 15 in hospital 2). A larger sample size means that the daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to be closer to the overall average of 50%, and also means there is a higher chance of deviations from the average (either above 60% or below 40%). Therefore, hospital 1 would likely see more days with more than 60% baby boys, compared to hospital 2.
