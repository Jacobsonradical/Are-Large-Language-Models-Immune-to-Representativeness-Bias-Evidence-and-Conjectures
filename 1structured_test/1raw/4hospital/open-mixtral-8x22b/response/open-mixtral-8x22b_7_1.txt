Based on the given information, it's more likely that hospital 2 recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the smaller sample size (15 babies per day) in hospital 2 compared to hospital 1 (45 babies per day). A smaller sample size can result in a greater variability in the percentage of boys from day to day, making it more likely to exceed 60%. However, this is a probabilistic answer and the actual result could be different.

So, my answer is: {hospital: 2}
