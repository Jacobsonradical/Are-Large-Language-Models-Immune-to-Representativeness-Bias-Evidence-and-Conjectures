{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. The reason is that hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day). A larger sample size generally provides more stable and reliable results. In this case, the larger sample size in hospital 1 would lead to a more accurate representation of the population mean (which is 50%), making it less likely to deviate more than 10% from the mean (to above 60%). However, the probability of deviating more than 10% from the mean is higher in hospital 2 due to its smaller sample size. But since the question asks for days when more than 60% of babies are boys, and considering the law of large numbers, hospital 1 is more likely to have more such days than hospital 2.
