{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day, which means the percentage of boys born on any given day is more likely to be closer to the expected value of 50%. In contrast, Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, making it more susceptible to larger deviations from the expected value of 50%. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 will have fewer days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys compared to Hospital 2, assuming the sex of each baby is a random event.
