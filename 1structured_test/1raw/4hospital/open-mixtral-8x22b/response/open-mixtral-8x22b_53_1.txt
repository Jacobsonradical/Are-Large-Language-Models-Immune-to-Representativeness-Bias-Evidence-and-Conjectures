{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day, with about 45 births compared to Hospital 2's 15 births. A larger sample size reduces the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day and makes it more likely that the percentage will stay close to 50%.

However, since the percentage of baby boys can vary from day to day, sometimes it may be higher than 60%. Given the larger sample size in Hospital 1, the percentage of days with more than 60% baby boys will be less variable and more stable, which would mean that Hospital 1 would record more such days compared to Hospital 2.

Moreover, the smaller sample size in Hospital 2 makes it more susceptible to larger swings in the percentage of baby boys born each day, which would result in fewer days with more than 60% baby boys being recorded.

Thus, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 2.
