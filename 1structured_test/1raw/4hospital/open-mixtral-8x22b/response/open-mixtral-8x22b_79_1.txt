{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. The reason is that even though the percentage of baby boys born each day varies, the larger number of births in hospital 1 (45 babies/day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies/day) allows for a more stable distribution of baby boys. This means that hospital 1 is more likely to have days with more than 60% of babies being boys, as the larger sample size allows for the 50% average to be more consistently represented. In contrast, hospital 2, with fewer daily births, would have a more variable percentage of baby boys day-to-day, making it less likely to consistently have days with more than 60% baby boys.
