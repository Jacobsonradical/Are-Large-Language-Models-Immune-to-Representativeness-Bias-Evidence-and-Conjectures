{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
The hospital with the higher number of daily births (Hospital 1) is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of babies born being boys. The reason is that larger sample sizes (number of births) tend to be closer to the expected value, in this case, 50% boys. However, there will still be more variability in the percentage of boys from day to day in Hospital 1 than in Hospital 2, due to larger sample sizes. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 will have more days when the percentage of boys is above 60%.
