{hospital: 1}

My reasoning is that since hospital 1 has a larger number of daily births (45 vs 15), the sample size of births is larger, making the percentage of baby boys born on any given day more likely to be closer to the expected value of 50%. Due to the larger sample size, fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys will be less extreme, making it less likely for hospital 1 to have more than 60% baby boys on a given day. However, given the larger number of daily births, even if the percentage is less extreme, the actual number of baby boys can still exceed 60% of the daily births more frequently than in hospital 2, where the smaller sample size could lead to more extreme fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys, but would require a higher percentage to reach the threshold of more than 60% of the daily births.
