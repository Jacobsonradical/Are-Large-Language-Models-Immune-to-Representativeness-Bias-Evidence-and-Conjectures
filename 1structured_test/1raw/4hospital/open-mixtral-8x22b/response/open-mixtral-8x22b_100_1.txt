{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Since hospital 1 has a larger sample size of births each day (45 vs 15), its percentage of baby boys born will be more stable and closer to the expected value of 50%. In other words, the variability in the daily percentage of baby boys born will be smaller in hospital 1 compared to hospital 2. Therefore, it's less likely for hospital 1 to observe days with more than 60% baby boys, making it more likely for hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, to observe more such days. However, given that the question asks for the hospital that recorded more days with over 60% baby boys being born, the answer would be hospital 1, as it has more daily births, and thus, more opportunities for the percentage of baby boys to exceed 60%. The conclusion is based on the assumption that the daily percentage of baby boys born in both hospitals follows a binomial distribution, with a higher number of trials (births) leading to a smaller variance and less extreme values in the daily percentage of baby boys.
