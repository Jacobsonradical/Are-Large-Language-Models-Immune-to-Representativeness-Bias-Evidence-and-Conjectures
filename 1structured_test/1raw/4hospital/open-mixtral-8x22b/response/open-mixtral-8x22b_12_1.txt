{hospital: 1}

I think that hospital 1 recorded more such days. This is based on the law of large numbers, which suggests that larger sample sizes tend to produce results closer to the expected value. In this case, hospital 1 has a larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies). Therefore, hospital 1's larger sample size would result in a more stable and consistent ratio of male to female births, making it less likely to deviate from the expected 50% ratio. Consequently, it would also be less likely to reach the 60% threshold for recording the days when more than 60% of babies born are boys. However, it is important to note that this is a statistical prediction based on probability and the actual outcome could still vary.
