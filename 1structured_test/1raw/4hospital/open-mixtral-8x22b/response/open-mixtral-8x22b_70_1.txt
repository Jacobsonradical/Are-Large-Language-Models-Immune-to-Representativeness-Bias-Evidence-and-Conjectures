{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. The larger the sample size, the closer the actual ratio will be to the expected ratio. Since hospital 1 has a larger daily birth rate, it is more likely to have a higher number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to the law of large numbers.
