{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
The variation in the exact percentage of boys born each day follows a binomial distribution. The possible outcomes are more pronounced when the sample size (number of babies born) is smaller. Therefore, the smaller hospital (hospital 2) will have a wider variation in the percentage of boys born each day, meaning it will have days with a higher percentage of boys born, but also days with a lower percentage.

However, the probability of having more than 60% boys born in a day decreases as the number of babies born increases. Since hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born each day (45 vs. 15), it is less likely to have days with more than 60% boys born compared to hospital 2.

But because hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born each day, the overall number of days with more than 60% boys born will be higher compared to hospital 2, even though the probability of such an event is lower.

Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% boys born.
