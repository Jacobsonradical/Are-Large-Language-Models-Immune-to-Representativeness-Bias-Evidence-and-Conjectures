Explanation:
The likelihood of a hospital having more than 60% boys born in a day is higher when the total number of births is smaller. This is because larger sample sizes tend to be closer to the expected value (in this case, 50%), while smaller sample sizes have a higher probability of deviating from the expected value. Since hospital 2 has a smaller number of births per day, it is more likely to have days with more than 60% boys. However, the question asks for the hospital that recorded more such days, not the hospital where this event is more likely to happen.

Since hospital 1 has three times as many births per day as hospital 2, it means that hospital 1 will have three times as many opportunities for a day with more than 60% boys. Even though the probability of this happening on any given day is lower for hospital 1, the sheer number of opportunities makes it more likely that hospital 1 will have more such days over the course of a year. Therefore, I believe that hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys.
