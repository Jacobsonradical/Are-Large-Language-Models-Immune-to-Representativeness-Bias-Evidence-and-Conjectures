{hospital: 1}

The reasoning behind this answer is that hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day compared to hospital 2. This means that hospital 1 has a larger sample size of births each day, which makes the distribution of the number of boys born each day less variable and more likely to be close to the expected value of 50%. However, since the question asks for days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys, we are looking for days where the number of boys born deviates significantly from the expected value.

Because hospital 1 has a larger sample size, it has a higher probability of having days where the number of boys born is significantly higher than 50%. In contrast, hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, has a lower probability of having days where the number of boys born is significantly higher than 50%. Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys than hospital 2.
