{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). 
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The law of large numbers suggests that with larger sample sizes, the observed results will be closer to the true probability.  In this case, the true probability of a baby being a boy is roughly 50%. 
* **Fluctuation:** While daily variation in the percentage of boys born is expected, the larger sample size in hospital 1 will mean that these fluctuations are less likely to cause a day to reach over 60% boys.

Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to have fewer days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60% than hospital 2.
