{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs. 15).  
* **Law of Large Numbers:**  The law of large numbers suggests that with a larger sample size, the observed proportion of boys will tend to be closer to the true population proportion (around 50%).
* **Fluctuations:** While daily percentages of boys can fluctuate, these fluctuations will be more pronounced in the smaller sample size of Hospital 2. This means Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys is either significantly above or below 50%.

Therefore, it's more likely that Hospital 1 will have more days where the percentage of baby boys born is over 60% simply because it has a larger sample size, leading to a more stable and consistent proportion.
