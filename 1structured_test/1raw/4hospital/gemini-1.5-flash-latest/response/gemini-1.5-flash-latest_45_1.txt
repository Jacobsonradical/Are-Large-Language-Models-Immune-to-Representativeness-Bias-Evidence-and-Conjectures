{hospital: 1}

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day).
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The Law of Large Numbers states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample will get closer to the true average. In this case, the true average percentage of baby boys is around 50%.
* **More Stability:**  With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is less likely to experience extreme fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys born each day. This means they are less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys compared to Hospital 2. 

**Therefore, it's more likely that Hospital 1 recorded fewer days with more than 60% boys.**
