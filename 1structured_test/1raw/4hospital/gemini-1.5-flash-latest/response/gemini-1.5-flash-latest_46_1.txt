{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born each day in hospital 1 is likely to fluctuate less drastically around the average 50%.  
* **Reaching 60%:** Because of the smaller fluctuations in hospital 1, it's more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.  While hospital 2 might have some days with more than 60% boys, the smaller sample size makes it more susceptible to larger daily swings in the percentage.
