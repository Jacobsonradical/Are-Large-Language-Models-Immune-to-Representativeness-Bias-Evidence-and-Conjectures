{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). 
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to see the proportion of baby boys fluctuate closer to the true average (around 50%) over time. 
* **Fluctuations:**  Daily fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys born are more likely to result in a higher percentage of days exceeding 60% boy births in the smaller sample size of Hospital 2. This is because even a small deviation from the average (50%) can have a larger impact on the overall percentage when the sample size is smaller.
