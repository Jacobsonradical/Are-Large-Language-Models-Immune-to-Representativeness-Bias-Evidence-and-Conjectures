{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs 15).  
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, the birth ratio of boys to girls is more likely to fluctuate closer to the overall average of 50%.  
* **Statistical Fluctuations:** Smaller sample sizes (like hospital 2) are more susceptible to larger day-to-day fluctuations in the percentage of boys born. This means it's more likely for hospital 2 to have days where the percentage of boys born is significantly higher than 60%. 

**Therefore, it's more likely that hospital 1 would record more days with over 60% boys.**
