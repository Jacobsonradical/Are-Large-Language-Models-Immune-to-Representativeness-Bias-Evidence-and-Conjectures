{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs 15). This means they have a larger sample size to work with.
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample will get closer to the true average.  With a larger sample, Hospital 1 is more likely to see its daily percentages of baby boys fluctuate less dramatically around the overall 50% average. 
* **Smaller Fluctuations:**  Because Hospital 1 has a larger sample size, its daily percentage of baby boys will likely fluctuate less. It's less likely to have extreme days where over 60% of the babies are boys. 

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have fewer days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, compared to Hospital 2.
