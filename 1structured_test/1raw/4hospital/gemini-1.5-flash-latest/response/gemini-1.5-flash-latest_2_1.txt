{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies/day). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born each day in Hospital 1 is less likely to fluctuate drastically from the overall average of 50%.  
* **Probability of Reaching 60%:** It's more probable for a larger sample to have a day where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%, even if the overall average is 50%. 

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys.
