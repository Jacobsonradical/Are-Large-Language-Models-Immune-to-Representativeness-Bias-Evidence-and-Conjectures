{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies).  
* **Statistical Fluctuation:** With a larger sample size, the percentage of baby boys born each day at hospital 1 is more likely to be closer to the true average (around 50%) due to the law of large numbers. This means there's less room for random fluctuation to push the percentage above 60%.
* **Smaller Sample Size:** Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more susceptible to random fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys born each day. This makes it more likely to have days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60% purely by chance.

**In short, the hospital with the larger number of births is less likely to have days where the percentage of boys born is significantly above the average.**
