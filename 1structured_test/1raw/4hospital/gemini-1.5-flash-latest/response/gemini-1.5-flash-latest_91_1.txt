{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger daily birth rate (45 babies vs. 15 babies). This means there are more opportunities for the percentage of boys to fluctuate, and it's more likely to hit the 60% threshold on some days purely due to random chance. 
* **Law of Large Numbers:**  The Law of Large Numbers states that as the sample size increases, the observed results will get closer to the true population average (50% in this case).  While the daily percentage of boys will vary, Hospital 1's larger sample size will tend to keep the overall percentage closer to 50% over the long run.

Therefore, Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have more days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60%.
