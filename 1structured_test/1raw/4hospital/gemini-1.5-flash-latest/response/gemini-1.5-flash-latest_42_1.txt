{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs 15).  
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, the results are more likely to be closer to the true average (around 50% boys). This means that Hospital 1 is less likely to have extreme fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys born on any given day.
* **Higher Probability of Extremes:** With a smaller sample size (Hospital 2), there's a higher chance of random variation leading to days where the percentage of boys born is significantly above or below the true average. This increases the probability of Hospital 2 recording more days with over 60% boys.
