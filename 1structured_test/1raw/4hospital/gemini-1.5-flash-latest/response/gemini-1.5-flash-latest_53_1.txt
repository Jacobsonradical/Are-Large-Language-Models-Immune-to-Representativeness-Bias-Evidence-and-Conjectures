{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies/day). 
* **Statistical Variation:**  With a larger sample size, the daily variation in the percentage of baby boys is likely to be smaller.  Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys stays closer to the overall average (50%).
* **Reaching the Threshold:**  It's easier for a larger sample size to exceed a specific threshold like 60% boys.  Even a small deviation from the average in Hospital 1's larger group could push the percentage above 60%, while Hospital 2 would need a larger deviation.

**In summary:** Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have more days where over 60% of the babies born are boys.
