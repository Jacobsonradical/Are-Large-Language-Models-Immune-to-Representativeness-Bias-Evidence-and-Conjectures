{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies vs 15 babies per day). 
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys born is more likely to be closer to the overall average of 50%. 
* **Fluctuations:**  While daily percentages fluctuate, Hospital 1's larger sample size will make these fluctuations less extreme compared to Hospital 2.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have more days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60% due to its larger sample size.
