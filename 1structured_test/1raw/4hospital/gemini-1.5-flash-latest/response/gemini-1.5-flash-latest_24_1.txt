{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies). 
* **Statistical fluctuations:**  While the overall percentage of boys born is about 50%, daily fluctuations are more likely to be noticeable in smaller sample sizes. 
* **Probability:**  With a larger sample size, the probability of getting a significantly higher percentage of boys (over 60%) on any given day is reduced. 

In simpler terms, the larger the sample size, the less likely it is to be influenced by random variation, making it less likely to have days with significantly more boys than girls.
