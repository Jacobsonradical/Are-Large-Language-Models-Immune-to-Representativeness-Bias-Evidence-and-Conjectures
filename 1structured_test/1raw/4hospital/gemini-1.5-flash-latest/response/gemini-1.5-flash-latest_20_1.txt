{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  While the overall percentage of baby boys is around 50%, daily fluctuations are more likely to be significant in smaller sample sizes.  
* **Probability:** With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 has a greater chance of having days where the percentage of boys born is closer to the overall average (50%).  It's less likely to experience extreme swings due to random chance.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
