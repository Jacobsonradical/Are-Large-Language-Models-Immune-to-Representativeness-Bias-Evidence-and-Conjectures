{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs 15).  
* **Statistical Variation:**  While the overall percentage of baby boys is around 50%, the daily percentage will fluctuate.  With a larger sample size, the fluctuations will be smaller, making it less likely for Hospital 1 to have days where the percentage of boys drastically exceeds 60%. 

In simpler terms, Hospital 1 is more likely to have a consistent number of boys born each day, making it less likely to have days where the percentage of boys shoots up to 60% or more.
