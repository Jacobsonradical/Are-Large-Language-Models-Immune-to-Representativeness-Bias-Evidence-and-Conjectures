{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births each day (45 vs 15).
* **Statistical variation:**  With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to fluctuate closer to the overall 50% average.  In hospital 2, with fewer births, the percentage of boys could swing more dramatically from day to day. 
* **Probability:**  While any individual day's outcome is random, over a year, hospital 1 is more likely to have more days where the percentage of boys born is close to 50% (and therefore more likely to have days above 60%).
