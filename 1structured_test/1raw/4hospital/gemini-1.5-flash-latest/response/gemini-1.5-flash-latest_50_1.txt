{hospital: 1}

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births each day (45 vs. 15).
* **Law of Large Numbers:**  The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the observed results will get closer to the expected value (in this case, 50% boys). 
* **Fluctuation Impact:** With a larger sample, daily fluctuations in the percentage of boys born will have a smaller impact on the overall percentage. Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born is closer to the expected 50%.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have fewer days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.
