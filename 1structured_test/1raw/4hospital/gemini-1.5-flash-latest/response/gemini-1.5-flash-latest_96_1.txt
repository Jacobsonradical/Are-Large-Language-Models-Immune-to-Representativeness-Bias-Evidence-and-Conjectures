{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger daily birth rate (45 babies vs. 15).  
* **Statistical variation:** While the overall percentage of baby boys is around 50%, the daily fluctuations are more likely to be averaged out in a larger sample.  

With a larger sample, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys is closer to the true average (50%) than Hospital 2. This means it's less likely to have days exceeding 60% of baby boys.
