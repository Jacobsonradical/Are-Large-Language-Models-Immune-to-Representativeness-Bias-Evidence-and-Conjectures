{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger sample size of babies born each day (45 vs 15).
* **Statistical Variation:**  With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born on any given day is more likely to fluctuate closer to the overall average (50%).  A smaller sample size like Hospital 2 is more susceptible to larger, random variations.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born is slightly above 60% due to its larger sample size.
