{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger sample size of babies born each day (45 vs. 15). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys is less likely to fluctuate wildly.  Smaller sample sizes are more susceptible to random variations. 

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60% simply because its daily sample size is larger and less prone to extreme fluctuations.
