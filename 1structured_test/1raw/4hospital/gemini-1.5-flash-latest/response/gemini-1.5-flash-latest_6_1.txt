{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day).
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The Law of Large Numbers states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample will get closer to the true average.  
* **Statistical Fluctuations:** With a smaller sample size, the percentage of boys born each day at Hospital 2 is more likely to fluctuate significantly from the true 50%. Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, will have less dramatic day-to-day variation.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have more days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60% simply because its larger sample size makes it less susceptible to random fluctuations.
