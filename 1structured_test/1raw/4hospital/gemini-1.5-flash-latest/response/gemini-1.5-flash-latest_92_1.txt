{hospital: 1}

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births each day (45 vs. 15). 
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to see the percentage of baby boys fluctuate closer to the overall average (50%) over time.  
* **Statistical Fluctuation:** Even with a 50% average, daily fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys are more likely to be extreme in a smaller sample size (Hospital 2).

Therefore, Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have a smaller variation from the average and fewer days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.
