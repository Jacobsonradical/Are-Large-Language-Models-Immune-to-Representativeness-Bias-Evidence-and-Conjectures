{hospital: 1}

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies). 
* **Law of Averages:**  With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys born at hospital 1 is more likely to be closer to the overall average of 50%. This means it's less likely to fluctuate significantly above 60%.
* **Fluctuation:**  Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, is more susceptible to larger daily fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys. It's more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys surpasses 60% due to random chance. 

Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
