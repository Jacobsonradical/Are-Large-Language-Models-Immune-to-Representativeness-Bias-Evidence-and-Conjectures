{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs 15). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to fluctuate around the average of 50%.  While both hospitals will experience days with more or less than 50% boys, the larger sample size in hospital 1 will make it more likely to have days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%.  

Think of it like flipping a coin. With a small number of flips, you're more likely to get streaks of heads or tails. With a large number of flips, the results tend to even out closer to a 50/50 split.
