{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger daily birth rate (45 babies vs. 15 babies). This means there are more individual births to contribute to the overall percentage of boys born each day. 
* **Statistical Variation:**  With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys in hospital 1 is likely to fluctuate less dramatically than in hospital 2. This means it's more probable that hospital 1 would have more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.

While the exact percentage of boys born varies, the larger sample size in hospital 1 makes it statistically more likely to have more days with a higher percentage of boys.
