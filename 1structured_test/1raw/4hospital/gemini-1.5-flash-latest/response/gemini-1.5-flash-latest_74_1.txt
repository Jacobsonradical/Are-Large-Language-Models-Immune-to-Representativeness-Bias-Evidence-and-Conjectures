{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs 15).  
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The Law of Large Numbers states that as the sample size increases, the observed results will get closer to the true probability.  With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born is closer to the overall average of 50%.

**In simpler terms:**  It's easier for a larger group to have a day where the percentage of boys is slightly above 60% by random chance. Hospital 1 is more likely to experience this variation due to its larger sample size.
