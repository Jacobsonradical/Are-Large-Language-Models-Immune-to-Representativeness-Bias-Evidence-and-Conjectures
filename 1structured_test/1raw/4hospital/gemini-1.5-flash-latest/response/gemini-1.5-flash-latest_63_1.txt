{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day. With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of boys born is more likely to fluctuate closer to the overall average of 50%. 
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample will get closer to the true population average.  Hospital 1's larger sample size means its daily birth proportions will tend to be closer to 50%, making it less likely to have days where more than 60% of babies are boys.
* **Statistical Fluctuation:** With a smaller sample size (Hospital 2), there's a greater chance for random fluctuations in the percentage of boys born each day. This increases the probability of having days where the percentage of boys is higher than 60%.
