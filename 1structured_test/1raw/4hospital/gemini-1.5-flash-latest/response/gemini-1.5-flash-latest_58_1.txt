{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies).
* **Statistical fluctuations:** While the overall average of baby boys is 50%, daily percentages can fluctuate. With a larger sample size, these fluctuations will be less extreme in Hospital 1.  
* **Probability:** In Hospital 1, even a slight deviation from 50% will result in a larger number of baby boys needed to reach the 60% threshold. This makes it more likely to have days with more than 60% boys born.

**In summary:** Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, will have a greater chance of experiencing days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60%.
