{hospital: 1}

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies).
* **Statistical Variation:**  With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to fluctuate closer to the overall average of 50%. Smaller sample sizes in hospital 2 are more susceptible to larger fluctuations due to chance.

Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys born is above 60% simply because it has more births to average out the natural variation.
