{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies/day). 
* **Statistical Variation:**  With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born each day is likely to fluctuate less drastically around the overall average of 50%.
* **Reaching 60%:** Because Hospital 1 has more babies born each day, it's more likely to have days where a slightly higher proportion of boys (even just a few more) pushes the percentage above 60%.  

In short, the larger sample size at Hospital 1 makes it statistically more likely to experience days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.
