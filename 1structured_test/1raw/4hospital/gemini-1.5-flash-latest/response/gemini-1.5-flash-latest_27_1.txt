{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs 15).  
* **Statistical Fluctuation:** With a larger sample size, the percentage of baby boys born on any given day is more likely to be closer to the overall average (50%) due to the law of large numbers.  Smaller samples are more susceptible to larger fluctuations.

Therefore, it's more likely that Hospital 1 would experience more days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60% simply because they have more births to average out the day-to-day variations.
