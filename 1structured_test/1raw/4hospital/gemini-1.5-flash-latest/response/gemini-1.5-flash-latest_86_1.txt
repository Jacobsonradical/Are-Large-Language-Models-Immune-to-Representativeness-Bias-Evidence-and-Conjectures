{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  With a larger sample size, the percentage of baby boys born on any given day is more likely to be closer to the overall average of 50%. Smaller sample sizes are more susceptible to larger fluctuations. 
* **Probability of Extreme Days:**  Because Hospital 1 has more births, it's more likely to have days where the percentage of boys is significantly higher than 60% simply due to random variation.  

**In short:**  Hospital 1's larger sample size makes it more likely to have more days where the percentage of baby boys born is greater than 60%.
