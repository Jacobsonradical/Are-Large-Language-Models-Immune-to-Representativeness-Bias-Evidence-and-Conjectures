{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies/day).
* **Statistical Fluctuation:** With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born each day in Hospital 1 is likely to fluctuate less drastically around the overall 50% average.  
* **Reaching the Threshold:**  It's statistically easier for a larger group (Hospital 1) to have a day where more than 60% of the babies are boys, simply due to the higher number of births.  Even a small deviation from the average in a larger sample can push the percentage above 60%.

While the exact percentage of boys varies day to day, the larger sample size in Hospital 1 makes it more likely to have more days where the percentage exceeds 60%.
