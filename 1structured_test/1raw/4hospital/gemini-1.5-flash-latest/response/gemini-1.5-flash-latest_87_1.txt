{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger daily birth rate (45 babies vs. 15 babies).  
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The Law of Large Numbers states that as the sample size increases, the results will get closer to the true population average.  With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys is closer to the true population average of 50%.
* **Fluctuation:** Even though the true percentage of baby boys fluctuates, Hospital 1's larger sample size will dampen the effect of these fluctuations. In other words, it's less likely for the percentage of boys to swing significantly above or below 60% on any given day in Hospital 1.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
