{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger sample size (45 babies) than hospital 2 (15 babies) each day. 
* **Statistical Variation:**  With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born each day in Hospital 1 is likely to be closer to the true average (around 50%) than in Hospital 2.  This means there will be less day-to-day variation in the percentage of boys born at Hospital 1.
* **Reaching 60%:**  Since the percentage of boys at Hospital 1 is more likely to be closer to 50% than at Hospital 2, it's more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.  

**In summary:** The larger sample size at Hospital 1 makes it statistically more likely to have more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.
