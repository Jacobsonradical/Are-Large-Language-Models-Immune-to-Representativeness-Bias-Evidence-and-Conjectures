{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies per day vs. 15 babies per day).  
* **Statistical Fluctuation:** While the average percentage of baby boys is around 50%, daily fluctuations are more likely to be noticeable in smaller sample sizes.  
* **Probability:**  With a larger sample, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys is closer to the true average of 50%.  This means there's a higher probability of a day with a slightly higher percentage of boys exceeding the 60% threshold. 

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
