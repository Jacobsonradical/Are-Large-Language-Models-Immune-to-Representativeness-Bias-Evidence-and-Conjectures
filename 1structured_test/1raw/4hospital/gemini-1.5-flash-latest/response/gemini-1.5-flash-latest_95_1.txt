{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). 
* **Statistical Fluctuations:** With a larger sample size, the daily fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys born are likely to be smaller. Hospital 1's larger sample size will average out the random variations in the boy/girl ratio more effectively.
* **Probability:**  Even though the overall percentage of baby boys is around 50%,  there's a higher probability that Hospital 1 will have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys simply because of the larger sample size.  

While Hospital 2 could experience days with more than 60% boys, these days are likely to be less frequent due to the smaller sample size.
