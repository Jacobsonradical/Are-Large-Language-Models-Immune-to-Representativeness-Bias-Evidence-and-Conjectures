{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births each day (45 vs. 15). This means that the daily percentage of boys born is likely to fluctuate less dramatically due to the law of large numbers.
* **Statistical Fluctuation:** With a smaller sample size (hospital 2), the percentage of boys born is more prone to larger fluctuations from day to day.  Even a few more or fewer boys can shift the percentage noticeably.

**Therefore, hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have a more consistent percentage of boys born each day, making it less likely to exceed the 60% threshold.**
