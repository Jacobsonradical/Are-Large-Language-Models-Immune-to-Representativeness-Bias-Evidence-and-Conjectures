{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births each day (45 vs 15).  
* **Statistical variation:** While the overall percentage of baby boys is around 50%, daily fluctuations are more likely to be smoothed out in a larger sample. 
* **Probability:** With a larger sample, it's more likely that a day will have a percentage of baby boys closer to the true average (around 50%). This means there's a higher chance of a day with over 60% boys at Hospital 1.

**In summary:**  Because Hospital 1 has a larger sample size, it's more likely to experience days where the percentage of baby boys born is closer to the true average (and thus more likely to have days with over 60% boys).
