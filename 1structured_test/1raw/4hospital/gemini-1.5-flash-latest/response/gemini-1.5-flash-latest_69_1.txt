{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies/day). 
* **Statistical Fluctuations:**  With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born each day in Hospital 1 is likely to be closer to the overall 50% average.  This means there's less room for large fluctuations in the percentage of boys on any given day. 
* **More Days Above 60%:**  Since Hospital 1 has less variation in daily percentages, it's more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.  

While the exact percentage of boys varies, the larger sample size makes Hospital 1 more statistically stable, resulting in a higher probability of recording more days with over 60% boys.
