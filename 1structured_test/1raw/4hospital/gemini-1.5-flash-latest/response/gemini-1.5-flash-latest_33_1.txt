{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day).
* **Statistical Variation:**  While the overall percentage of baby boys is around 50%, daily fluctuations are more likely to have a noticeable impact on smaller sample sizes.  
* **Probability:** With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys born is closer to the long-term average (50%). Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to experience greater daily fluctuations, making it more probable to have days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.
