{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births each day (45 vs. 15). This means there are more opportunities for the percentage of boys to fluctuate and potentially exceed 60%.
* **Statistical Fluctuations:** With a smaller sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys at Hospital 2 is more likely to be influenced by random variation. It would take a larger deviation from the average 50% to reach 60% consistently. 

While the exact percentage of boys born each day varies, the larger sample size of Hospital 1 makes it more probable that they would have more days where the percentage of boys born exceeded 60%.
