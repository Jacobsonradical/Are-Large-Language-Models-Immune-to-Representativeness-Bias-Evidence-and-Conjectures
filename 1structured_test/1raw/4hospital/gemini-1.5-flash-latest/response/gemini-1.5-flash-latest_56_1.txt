{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies).
* **Statistical variation:** While the overall percentage of baby boys is around 50%, the daily percentage will fluctuate. With a larger sample size, the fluctuations in Hospital 1 are likely to be smaller and less dramatic compared to Hospital 2. 

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have a higher number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, simply because its sample size is larger and more likely to reflect the overall average.
