{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies/day).
* **Statistical variation:**  With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to fluctuate closer to the overall average of 50%. This is because random variations in smaller samples are more pronounced.

Therefore, hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys dips below 60% due to random fluctuations. This means it's also more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.
