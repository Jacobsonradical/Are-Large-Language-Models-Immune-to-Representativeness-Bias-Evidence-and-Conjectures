{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger daily birth rate (45 babies vs 15 babies). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to experience days where the percentage of baby boys is closer to the overall average (50%) due to the law of large numbers. Smaller sample sizes are more susceptible to random fluctuations.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have more days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60%.
