{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies/day).
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  With smaller sample sizes, there's a greater chance of larger day-to-day fluctuations in the percentage of boys born.  
* **Law of Large Numbers:**  The law of large numbers states that as sample size increases, the observed results will converge closer to the true population average (around 50% boys).  Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have its daily percentages stay closer to the overall average, making it less likely to have a day with over 60% boys.
