{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size of babies born each day (45 vs. 15). 
* **Statistical Fluctuations:**  With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born each day at hospital 1 is likely to be closer to the overall average of 50%.  Smaller sample sizes (like at hospital 2) are more susceptible to larger daily fluctuations in the percentage of boys born.

This means hospital 1 is less likely to have days where the percentage of boys born is significantly above 60%, while hospital 2 is more likely to have those days due to the smaller sample size.
