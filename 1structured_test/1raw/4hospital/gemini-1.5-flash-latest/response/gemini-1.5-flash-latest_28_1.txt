{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size of births each day (45 vs. 15). 
* **Statistical variation:**  With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of boys born is likely to be closer to the overall average (50%) due to the law of large numbers.  
* **Fluctuations:** Smaller samples (like Hospital 2) are more susceptible to larger daily fluctuations in the percentage of boys born. This means Hospital 2 is more likely to have days with more than 60% boys, simply due to chance. 

**In summary:** While both hospitals might have some days with more than 60% boys, Hospital 1's larger sample size makes it less likely to have a large number of such days compared to Hospital 2.
