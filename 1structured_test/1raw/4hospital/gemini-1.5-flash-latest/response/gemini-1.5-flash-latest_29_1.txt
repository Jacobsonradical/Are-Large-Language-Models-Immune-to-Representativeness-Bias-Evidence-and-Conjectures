{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger sample size of births each day (45 vs 15).
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, the births at hospital 1 are more likely to reflect the overall average of 50% boys.  
* **Fluctuations:**  Smaller samples (like hospital 2) are more susceptible to day-to-day fluctuations.  It's easier for a smaller number of births to skew the percentage of boys significantly higher or lower than 60%.

Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys due to its larger sample size.
