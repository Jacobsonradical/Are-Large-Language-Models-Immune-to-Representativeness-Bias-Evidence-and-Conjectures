{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births each day (45 vs 15). This means there are more opportunities for the percentage of boys to fluctuate.
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to experience days where the percentage of boys born is closer to the true average (around 50%). This makes it more likely for Hospital 1 to have days where over 60% of babies are boys.

While the exact percentage of boys born will vary each day, the larger sample size of Hospital 1 gives it a statistical advantage in recording more days with over 60% boys.
