{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day).
* **Statistical Fluctuation:** With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born each day in hospital 1 is likely to be closer to the true population average (around 50%) due to the law of large numbers. This means there's less chance of significant deviations from 50% in hospital 1 compared to hospital 2.
* **Greater Probability of Reaching 60%:**  Since hospital 1's daily births are more likely to be closer to the average, there's a higher probability that a day's births will exceed 60% boys, even with slight variations in the daily percentage.

**In summary, the larger sample size in hospital 1 makes it more likely to have days where over 60% of babies born are boys.**
