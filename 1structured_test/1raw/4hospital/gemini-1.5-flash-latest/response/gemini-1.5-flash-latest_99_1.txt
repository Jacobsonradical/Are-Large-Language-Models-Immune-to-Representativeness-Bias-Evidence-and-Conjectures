{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies). 
* **Statistical Variation:** While the overall percentage of baby boys is about 50%, daily variations are expected.  With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born on any given day at Hospital 1 is more likely to be closer to the overall average (50%) than at Hospital 2.
* **Reaching 60%:**  Because Hospital 1 has more births, it's easier for a slight variation in the percentage of baby boys to push the daily total over 60%.  With a smaller sample size, Hospital 2 would need a larger fluctuation to reach that threshold.
