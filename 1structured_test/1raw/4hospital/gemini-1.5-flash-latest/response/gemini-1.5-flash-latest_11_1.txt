{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births each day (45 vs. 15).
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to fluctuate closer to the overall average (50%) due to the law of averages.
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more susceptible to greater day-to-day fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys.  This means it's more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60% by chance.

In summary, while the overall percentage of baby boys is the same, the larger sample size at hospital 1 makes it less likely to have extreme variations from day to day, including those exceeding 60% boys.
