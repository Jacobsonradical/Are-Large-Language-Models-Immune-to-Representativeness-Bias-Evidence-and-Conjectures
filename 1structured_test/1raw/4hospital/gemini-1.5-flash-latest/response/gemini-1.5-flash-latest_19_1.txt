{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger daily birth rate (45 babies vs. 15 babies).  
* **Law of Large Numbers:** With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to fluctuate closer to the overall average (around 50%).  Smaller samples are more susceptible to larger variations.

This means that Hospital 1 is less likely to have days where the percentage of boys born dramatically deviates from 50%, making it less likely to have days with over 60% boys.
