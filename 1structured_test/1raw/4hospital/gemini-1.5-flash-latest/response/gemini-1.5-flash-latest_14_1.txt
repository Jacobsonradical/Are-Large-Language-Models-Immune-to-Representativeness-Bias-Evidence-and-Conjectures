{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births each day (45 vs. 15).  
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of boys born is more likely to be closer to the overall average of 50%. Smaller samples are more susceptible to larger fluctuations.

Therefore, Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born is closer to 50% and less likely to have days with extreme variations (like more than 60% boys).
