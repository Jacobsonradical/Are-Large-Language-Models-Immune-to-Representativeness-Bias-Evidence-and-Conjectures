{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births each day (45 vs. 15). This means there are more opportunities for the daily percentage of baby boys to fluctuate and potentially exceed 60%.
* **Law of Averages:**  While the overall average is about 50%, the larger sample size in Hospital 1 makes it more likely that the daily percentages will cluster closer to the average.  Hospital 2, with fewer births, has more room for larger deviations from the average.

In simpler terms, it's like flipping a coin.  If you flip 10 coins, you're more likely to get a result close to 5 heads and 5 tails.  But if you flip 40 coins, it's even more likely that the result will be closer to 20 heads and 20 tails.  The larger sample size makes the results more predictable.
