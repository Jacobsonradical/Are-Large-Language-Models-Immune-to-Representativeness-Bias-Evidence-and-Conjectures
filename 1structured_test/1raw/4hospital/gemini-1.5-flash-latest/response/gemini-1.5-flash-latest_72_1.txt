{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies). 
* **Statistical Fluctuations:** With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born each day in hospital 1 is more likely to fluctuate closer to the true average (50%) than in hospital 2.  
* **Higher Probability of Exceeding 60%:**  Because of the larger sample size, hospital 1 has a higher probability of experiencing days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%, even if the overall average is 50%.
