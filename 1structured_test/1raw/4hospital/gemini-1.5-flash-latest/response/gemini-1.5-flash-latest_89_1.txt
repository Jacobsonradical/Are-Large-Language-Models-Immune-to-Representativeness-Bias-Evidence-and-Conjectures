{hospital: 1}

Here's why:

* **Hospital 1 has a larger sample size.** With 45 births per day, Hospital 1 will have a larger number of babies to contribute to the daily percentage of boys.
* **Larger sample sizes are more likely to reflect the true population percentage.**  While daily fluctuations are expected, the larger sample size of Hospital 1 will tend to average out those fluctuations, making it more likely to be closer to the 50% average over time.
* **Small sample sizes are more susceptible to variation.** Hospital 2, with only 15 births per day, will be more likely to experience days where the percentage of boys is significantly higher or lower than the true average simply due to random chance.

Therefore, it's more likely that Hospital 1 would have more days where the percentage of baby boys is over 60%.
