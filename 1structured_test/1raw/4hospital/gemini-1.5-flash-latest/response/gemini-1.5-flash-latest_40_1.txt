{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies/day).
* **Statistical Fluctuation:** With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys born is likely to fluctuate less drastically around the average 50%. 
* **Reaching 60% Threshold:**  Because of the smaller fluctuations in Hospital 1, it's more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60% simply due to the larger number of babies. 

In essence, Hospital 1 has a better chance of exceeding the 60% threshold on more days due to its larger sample size, which makes it less susceptible to random daily variations.
