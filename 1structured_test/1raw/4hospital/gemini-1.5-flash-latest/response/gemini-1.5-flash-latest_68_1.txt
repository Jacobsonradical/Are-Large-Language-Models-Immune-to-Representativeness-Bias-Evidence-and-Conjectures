{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies). 
* **Statistical Fluctuations:** With a larger sample size, the percentage of baby boys born each day at hospital 1 is more likely to be closer to the overall average (50%) than the smaller sample at hospital 2. This means there's less chance for large fluctuations in the percentage of boys at hospital 1.

Therefore, because of the larger sample size at hospital 1, it's more likely to have fewer days where the percentage of boys born is significantly higher than 60%.
