{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies/day). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  While the overall percentage of baby boys is around 50%, daily fluctuations are more likely to be noticeable in smaller sample sizes. A few extra boys born at hospital 2 could easily push the percentage above 60% for a given day. In hospital 1, the larger number of births would make it more difficult for random fluctuations to result in such a high percentage of boys. 

Therefore, hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have fewer days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.
