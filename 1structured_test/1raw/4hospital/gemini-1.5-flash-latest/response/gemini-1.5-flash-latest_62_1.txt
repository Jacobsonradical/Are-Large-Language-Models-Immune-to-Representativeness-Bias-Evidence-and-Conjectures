{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). 
* **Law of Large Numbers:**  The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample will get closer to the true population average. This means that Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys is closer to the true population average (around 50%).
* **Fluctuation:**  While the exact percentage of baby boys fluctuates daily, the larger sample size in Hospital 1 will result in less extreme fluctuations.  A single day with an unusually high percentage of baby boys in Hospital 2 will have a greater impact on the overall percentage for that day than a similar event in Hospital 1.

Therefore, it's more likely that Hospital 1 will record more days with over 60% baby boys.
