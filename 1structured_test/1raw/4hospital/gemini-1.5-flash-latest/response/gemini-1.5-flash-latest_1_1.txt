{hospital: 1}

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs. 15).  
* **Law of Large Numbers:**  The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample will get closer to the true population average. In this case, the true population average is about 50% boys.  
* **Fluctuation:** While the percentage of boys born fluctuates daily, the larger sample size of Hospital 1 will tend to dampen the impact of these fluctuations, making it less likely to have a day with more than 60% boys compared to Hospital 2. 

**In summary, Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is less likely to experience extreme deviations from the average 50% boy ratio, making it less likely to record days with more than 60% boys.**
