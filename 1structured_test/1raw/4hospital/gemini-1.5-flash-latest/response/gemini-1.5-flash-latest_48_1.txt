{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size of births each day (45 vs 15).  
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to see its daily percentage of baby boys fluctuate closer to the overall average of 50%.  
* **Statistical Variation:** While both hospitals will experience daily variation, the variation is likely to be more pronounced with smaller sample sizes like Hospital 2. This means Hospital 2 is more likely to have days with a higher percentage of boys due to random chance. 

**In short:** Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, will experience less extreme swings in daily boy-to-girl ratios, making it less likely to have days exceeding 60% boys.
