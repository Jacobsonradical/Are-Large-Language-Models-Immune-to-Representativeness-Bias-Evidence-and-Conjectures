{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs. 15).  
* **Law of Large Numbers:**  With a larger sample size, the observed percentage of baby boys is more likely to be closer to the true average (which we know is around 50%).  
* **Fluctuations:** While daily variations in the percentage of boys are expected, these variations will be less pronounced in the larger sample size of Hospital 1. This makes it more likely for Hospital 1 to have more days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%.
