{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies/day).
* **Law of Averages:**  The law of averages suggests that with a larger sample size, the observed percentage of boys will tend to be closer to the true population percentage (50%). This is because random fluctuations in the proportion of boys born will have a smaller impact on the overall average.
* **Probability of Fluctuations:**  Even though the average percentage of boys is 50%, there will be daily variations.  With a smaller sample size (Hospital 2), it's more likely to experience days where the percentage of boys is significantly above or below 60% due to random chance.

In summary, because Hospital 1 has a larger sample size, it's more likely to have fewer days where the percentage of boys born deviates significantly from the average 50%, making it more likely to have fewer days with more than 60% boys.
