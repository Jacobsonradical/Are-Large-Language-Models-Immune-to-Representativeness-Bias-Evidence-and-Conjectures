{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger daily birth rate (45 vs 15). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  With a larger sample size, the percentage of baby boys born each day in Hospital 1 is more likely to fluctuate closer to the true average (around 50%) than in Hospital 2.
* **Higher Probability of Extremes:** Because of the larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born randomly falls above 60%. 

**In simpler terms:** Think of flipping a coin. If you flip it 15 times, you're less likely to get a streak of heads than if you flip it 45 times. The more times you flip, the more likely the results will even out closer to a 50/50 split.
