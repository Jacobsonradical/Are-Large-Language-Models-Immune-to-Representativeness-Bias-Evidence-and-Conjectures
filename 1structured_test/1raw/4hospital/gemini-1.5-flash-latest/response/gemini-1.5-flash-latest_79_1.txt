{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day. This means there are more opportunities for the percentage of boys born to fluctuate, including days where it exceeds 60%.
* **Law of Averages:**  With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to experience days closer to the average 50% boy birth rate, as well as days that deviate further from the average.

While the exact percentage of boys born will vary, the larger sample size at Hospital 1 increases the probability of having more days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%.
