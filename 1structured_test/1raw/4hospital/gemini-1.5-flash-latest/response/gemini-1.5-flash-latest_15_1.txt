{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size of babies born each day (45 vs 15).  
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to see the percentage of baby boys fluctuate closer to the overall average of 50%.  
* **Statistical Fluctuations:** Smaller sample sizes are more susceptible to larger random fluctuations.  Hospital 2, with fewer births each day, could experience days where the percentage of boys is significantly higher or lower than 50% due to chance alone.

**In summary:** While the exact percentage of boys varies, Hospital 1's larger sample size makes it more likely that they will have a more consistent percentage of boys closer to the overall average, and therefore fewer days where the percentage exceeds 60%.
