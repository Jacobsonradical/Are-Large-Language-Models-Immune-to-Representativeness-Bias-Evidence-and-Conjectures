{hospital: 1}

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births each day (45 vs 15). This means there's a higher probability of observing larger fluctuations in the percentage of boys born, even if the overall average is close to 50%. 
* **Statistical variation:**  With a smaller sample size (Hospital 2), random variations in the sex of babies born are more likely to cause bigger swings in the daily percentage of boys. It's easier for a smaller sample to be skewed away from the 50% average.

**In essence, the larger sample size at Hospital 1 gives it a higher chance of exceeding 60% boys on more days due to natural variation.**
