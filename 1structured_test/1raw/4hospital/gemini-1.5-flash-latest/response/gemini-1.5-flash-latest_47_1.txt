{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size of babies born each day (45 vs. 15). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  While the overall percentage of baby boys is close to 50%, daily fluctuations are more likely to be noticeable with a smaller sample size. 
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The Law of Large Numbers suggests that as the sample size increases, the observed proportion of an event (like baby boys) gets closer to the true proportion. This means Hospital 1 is more likely to have daily proportions closer to 50%, making it less likely to have days with more than 60% boys.

**Therefore, Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have more days where the proportion of baby boys exceeds 60%.**
