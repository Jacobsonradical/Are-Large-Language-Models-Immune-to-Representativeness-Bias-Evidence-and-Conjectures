{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs 15). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born each day in Hospital 1 is more likely to fluctuate closer to the true average (50%) than in Hospital 2. This means it's less likely to have days where it randomly swings to over 60% boys. 
* **Law of Averages:**  While daily fluctuations exist, over a longer period (like a year), Hospital 1's overall average of boys will likely be closer to 50%, making it less probable to have many days exceeding 60%. 

In short, the larger sample size at Hospital 1 makes it less likely to experience the extreme fluctuations necessary to have more days exceeding 60% boys.
