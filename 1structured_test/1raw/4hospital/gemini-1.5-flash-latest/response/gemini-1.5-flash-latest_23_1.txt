{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs. 15). 
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to see the percentage of boys born each day fluctuate closer to the true average of 50%.  
* **Random Fluctuation:**  While the percentage of boys born each day varies, the larger sample size in Hospital 1 will make the daily fluctuations less extreme, meaning it's less likely to have a day where over 60% are boys.

In short, because Hospital 1 has a larger sample size, it's less likely to see extreme deviations from the 50% average.
