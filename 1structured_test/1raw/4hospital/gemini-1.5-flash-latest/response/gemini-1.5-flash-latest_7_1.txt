{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs. 15).  
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to see the percentage of baby boys fluctuate closer to the true average (around 50%). This means it's more likely to have days where the percentage of boys is slightly above 60%. 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:** While the daily percentage of boys will vary, the larger the sample size, the less extreme the fluctuations are likely to be.

**In simpler terms:** Hospital 1, with more births, has a better chance of seeing days with a slightly higher percentage of boys just due to random chance.
