{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs. 15).  
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The Law of Large Numbers states that as the sample size increases, the results will tend to be closer to the true population average. In this case, the true population average is about 50% boys. 
* **Fluctuation:** With a smaller sample size (hospital 2), daily fluctuations in the percentage of boys are more likely to be extreme.  
* **Probability:**  While both hospitals will experience days where the percentage of boys is higher than 60%, it is statistically more likely to happen on days with more births due to the larger sample size.
