{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births each day (45 vs 15).
* **Law of Large Numbers:**  The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the results will more closely reflect the true probability.  
* **Variation in Percentages:** While the overall average of baby boys is 50%, daily percentages can fluctuate. With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is less likely to be significantly affected by these daily fluctuations.  

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.
