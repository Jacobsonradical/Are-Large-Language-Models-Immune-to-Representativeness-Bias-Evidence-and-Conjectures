{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger daily birth rate (45 babies vs. 15 babies). This means there are more opportunities for the percentage of boys to fluctuate significantly from day to day. 
* **Law of Averages:** While the overall percentage of boys is close to 50%,  the larger sample size of Hospital 1 makes it more likely to experience days where the percentage of boys born is higher than 60%.

**In simpler terms:**  It's like flipping a coin. If you flip a coin 15 times, you're less likely to get a streak of 10 heads than if you flip it 45 times.
