{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day).
* **Law of Averages:** With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys born at hospital 1 is more likely to fluctuate closer to the overall average of 50%.  
* **Greater Chance of Extremes:**  Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to experience greater day-to-day variation in the percentage of baby boys born. This means it's more likely to have days where the percentage of boys is significantly above or below 50%, including days that exceed 60%. 

**In conclusion:** While both hospitals will have days where more than 60% of babies are boys, Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is likely to have fewer such days because its daily percentages will be less prone to large fluctuations.
