{hospital: 1}

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day.  This means they have a larger sample size to work with.
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The law of large numbers suggests that as the sample size increases, the observed results will converge closer to the true underlying probability. Since Hospital 1 has a larger sample, its daily proportion of boys is likely to be closer to the true 50% than Hospital 2's.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have fewer days where the proportion of boys born exceeds 60% due to the larger sample size.
