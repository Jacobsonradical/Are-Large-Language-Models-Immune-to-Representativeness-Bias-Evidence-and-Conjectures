{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size of births each day (45 vs 15).
* **Statistical Fluctuations:** With smaller sample sizes, random variations in the percentage of baby boys born each day will be more pronounced. 
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample will get closer and closer to the true population average (which is around 50% boys).  

Therefore, Hospital 1, with its larger daily sample size, is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys born is closer to the true population average, even though the actual percentage fluctuates daily. This means Hospital 1 is more likely to have more days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60%.
