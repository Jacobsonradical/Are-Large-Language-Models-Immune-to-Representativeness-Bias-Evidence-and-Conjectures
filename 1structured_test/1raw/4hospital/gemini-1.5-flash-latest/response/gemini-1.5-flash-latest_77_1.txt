{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs 15). This means there are more opportunities for the percentage of baby boys to fluctuate around the 50% average. 
* **Law of Averages:**  With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to experience days where the percentage of baby boys is closer to the true population average (around 50%). However, with smaller sample sizes, like in Hospital 2, random fluctuations are more likely to create days with a higher percentage of boys. 

Therefore, Hospital 1 is likely to have more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60% due to its larger sample size and the tendency for larger samples to more closely reflect the true population percentage.
