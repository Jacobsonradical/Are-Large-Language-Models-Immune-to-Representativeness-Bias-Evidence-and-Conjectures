{hospital: 1}

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies/day).
* **Statistical Fluctuations:**  With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born each day in Hospital 1 is less likely to fluctuate wildly from the overall average (50%).
* **Probability of Extremes:**  Even though the overall percentage of boys is 50%, there's a higher chance of seeing days where more than 60% are boys in a smaller sample size (Hospital 2). This is due to the higher relative impact of individual births on the overall percentage.

Therefore, it's more likely that Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, would record more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
