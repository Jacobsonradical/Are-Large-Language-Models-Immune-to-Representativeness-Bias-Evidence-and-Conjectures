{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger daily birth rate (45 babies vs. 15).  
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of boys born is more likely to fluctuate closer to the overall average (50%). Smaller sample sizes are more susceptible to larger swings in percentages due to chance. 

Because Hospital 1 has a larger sample size, it's more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys is slightly above 60% due to random variation.
