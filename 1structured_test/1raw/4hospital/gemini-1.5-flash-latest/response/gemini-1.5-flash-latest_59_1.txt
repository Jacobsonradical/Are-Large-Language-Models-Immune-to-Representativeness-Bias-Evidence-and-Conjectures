{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies).
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys is likely to fluctuate less dramatically around the overall average of 50%.  
* **Reaching 60% Threshold:**  Hospital 1 has a better chance of having a day where a random fluctuation in births results in more than 60% being boys.  The larger sample size makes it statistically more likely.
