{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day).
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the observed results will more closely approximate the true probability.  
* **Statistical Fluctuation:** With smaller sample sizes, random fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys born each day are more likely to occur.  This means hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born is significantly higher or lower than 50% due to chance.

**In short:** Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have its daily percentages of baby boys cluster closer to the true average (around 50%). This makes it more likely to have more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.
