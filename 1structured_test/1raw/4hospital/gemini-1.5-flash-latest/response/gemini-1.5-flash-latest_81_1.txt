{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies vs. 15 babies per day). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys is less likely to fluctuate wildly from the overall average of 50%.  
* **More Days Above 60%:**  Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, would be more likely to have days where a slightly higher percentage of boys (above the 50% average) would result in exceeding 60%.

While the exact percentage of boys born each day varies, the larger sample size at hospital 1 makes it more likely to have days exceeding the 60% threshold.
