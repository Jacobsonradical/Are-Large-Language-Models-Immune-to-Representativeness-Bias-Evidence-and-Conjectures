{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  While the overall percentage of baby boys is close to 50%, daily variations are more likely to have a noticeable impact on smaller sample sizes. 
* **Law of Large Numbers:**  The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample will get closer and closer to the true population average.  Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have its daily percentages of baby boys closer to the overall 50% average.

Therefore, it's more likely that Hospital 1 would have fewer days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60%, compared to Hospital 2.
