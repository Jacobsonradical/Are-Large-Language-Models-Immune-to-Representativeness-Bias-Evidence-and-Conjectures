{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs 15). This means it has a larger sample size to work with.
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample will get closer to the true population average.  With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to experience daily fluctuations in the percentage of boys that are closer to the overall 50% average.
* **Probability:**  While both hospitals might see days where the percentage of boys is over 60%, the larger sample size of Hospital 1 makes it more likely to experience these "high-boy" days simply because there are more opportunities for variation. 

**Important Note:** This is a probabilistic argument, not a guarantee. It's possible for Hospital 2 to have a higher percentage of "high-boy" days due to random chance, but it's statistically less likely.
