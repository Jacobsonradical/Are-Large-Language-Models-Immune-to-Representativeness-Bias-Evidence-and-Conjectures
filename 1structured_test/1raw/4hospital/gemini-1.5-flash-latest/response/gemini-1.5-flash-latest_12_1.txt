{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger sample size of babies born each day (45 vs. 15). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:** While the overall percentage of baby boys is close to 50%, daily fluctuations are more likely to be noticeable in smaller samples. 
* **Probability:**  With a larger sample size, it's less likely that a day will randomly have a significantly higher percentage of boys simply due to chance.  

Therefore, hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to experience fewer days where the percentage of boys born is drastically higher than 60%.
