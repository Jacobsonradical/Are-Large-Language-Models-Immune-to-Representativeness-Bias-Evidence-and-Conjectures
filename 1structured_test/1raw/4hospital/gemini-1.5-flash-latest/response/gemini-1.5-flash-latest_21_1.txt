{hospital: 1}

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies/day).
* **Law of Averages:**  With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to see the percentage of baby boys fluctuate closer to the average 50% over time. This means they will have fewer days where the percentage of boys is significantly above 60%.
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, will experience more significant day-to-day variation in the percentage of boys born. This makes it more likely that they will have a higher number of days where the percentage of boys is above 60%. 

**In summary:** While the average percentage of boys is likely close to 50% in both hospitals, the smaller sample size at Hospital 2 makes it more prone to random fluctuations, increasing the chances of having more days with over 60% baby boys.
