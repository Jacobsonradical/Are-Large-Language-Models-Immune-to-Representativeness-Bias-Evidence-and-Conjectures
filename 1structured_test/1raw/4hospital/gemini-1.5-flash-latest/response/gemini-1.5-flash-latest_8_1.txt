{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies/day). 
* **Law of Averages:**  With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to reflect the true average percentage of baby boys (around 50%).  Smaller samples are more susceptible to random fluctuations. 
* **Statistical Variation:** While the daily percentage of baby boys varies, Hospital 1's larger sample size will tend to average out those variations, making it less likely to have days with significantly more than 60% boys. 

**Therefore, Hospital 1 is likely to have fewer days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.**
