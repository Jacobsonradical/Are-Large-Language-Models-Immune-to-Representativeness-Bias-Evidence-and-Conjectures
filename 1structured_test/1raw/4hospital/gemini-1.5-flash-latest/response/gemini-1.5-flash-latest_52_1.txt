{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger daily birth rate (45 babies vs. 15 babies). 
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample will get closer to the true population average.  This means that the daily percentage of baby boys in Hospital 1 is likely to fluctuate less drastically around the 50% mark compared to Hospital 2.
* **Greater Chance of Extreme Days:** With a smaller sample size, Hospital 2 is more susceptible to random fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys.  There's a higher chance that a few extra boys born on a given day will push the percentage above 60%.

Therefore, Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have a more consistent percentage of baby boys closer to 50%, making it less likely to have days exceeding 60% of boys.
