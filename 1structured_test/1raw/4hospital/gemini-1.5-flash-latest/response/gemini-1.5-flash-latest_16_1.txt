{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger number of births per day (45 vs. 15).  
* **Statistical Variation:** With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of boys born is likely to fluctuate less dramatically around the 50% average. This means Hospital 1 is less likely to have a day where a random fluctuation causes the percentage of boys to exceed 60%.
* **Law of Large Numbers:** The Law of Large Numbers suggests that as the sample size increases, the observed results will get closer to the true average. In this case, the true average is around 50%, so Hospital 1 with its larger sample size will be more likely to stay closer to that average.

While there's always a chance for random variation, the larger sample size at Hospital 1 gives it a statistical advantage in terms of consistency.
