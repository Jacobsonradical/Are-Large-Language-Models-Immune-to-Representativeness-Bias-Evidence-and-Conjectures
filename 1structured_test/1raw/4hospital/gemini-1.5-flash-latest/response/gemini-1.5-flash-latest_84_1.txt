{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day).
* **Law of large numbers:** The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample will get closer to the true population average.  
* **Statistical fluctuations:** While the average percentage of boys is around 50%, daily variations are more likely to even out in a larger sample size.  

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born is closer to the true average (around 50%), making it less likely to have days exceeding 60%.
