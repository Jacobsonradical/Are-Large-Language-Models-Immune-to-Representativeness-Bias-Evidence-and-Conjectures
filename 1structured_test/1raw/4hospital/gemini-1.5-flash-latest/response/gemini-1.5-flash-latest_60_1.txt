{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a significantly larger sample size (45 babies vs. 15 babies).  
* **Statistical Variation:**  Even though the average percentage of boys is 50%, there's natural day-to-day variation.  With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born is significantly higher than 50% due to random chance.

Think of it like flipping a coin: if you flip it 15 times, you might get a streak of heads, but if you flip it 45 times, you're less likely to have a streak that drastically deviates from 50/50.
