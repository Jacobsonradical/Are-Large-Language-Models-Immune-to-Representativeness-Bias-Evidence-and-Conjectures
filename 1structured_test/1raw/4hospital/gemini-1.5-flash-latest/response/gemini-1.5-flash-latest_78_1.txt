{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies).
* **Statistical Fluctuations:**  The smaller the sample size, the more susceptible it is to random fluctuations.  A few extra boys in a day at Hospital 2 can drastically shift the percentage towards 60%, while the same number of extra boys at Hospital 1 would have a less dramatic effect.

**In summary:** Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is less likely to experience large day-to-day fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys, making it more likely to have a higher number of days where over 60% of births are boys.
