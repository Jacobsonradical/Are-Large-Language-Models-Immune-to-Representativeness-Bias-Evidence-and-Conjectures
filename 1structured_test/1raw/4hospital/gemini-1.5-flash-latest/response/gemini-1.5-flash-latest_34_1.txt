{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger sample size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). 
* **Statistical variation:**  While the overall percentage of boys born is about 50%, the daily percentage fluctuates. With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to experience days where the percentage of boys born is closer to the true average (around 50%).
* **Law of large numbers:** The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the average of the observed values gets closer to the true average. 

Therefore, Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have a greater number of days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60%.
