{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger sample size of babies born each day (45 vs 15). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:** With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born each day is less likely to fluctuate drastically from the overall average of 50%.
* **Higher Probability:**  The larger sample size in hospital 1 gives it a higher probability of having more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.

While the exact percentage of baby boys will vary, the larger sample size at hospital 1 makes it more likely to record more days with a higher proportion of boys.
