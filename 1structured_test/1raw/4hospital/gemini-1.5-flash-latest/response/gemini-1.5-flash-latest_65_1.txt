{hospital: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Larger Sample Size:** Hospital 1 has a much larger sample size of babies born each day (45 vs. 15). 
* **Statistical Fluctuation:**  With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born on any given day is more likely to be closer to the true average (around 50%). Smaller sample sizes are more susceptible to larger fluctuations.

**Reasoning:**  While the exact percentage of baby boys fluctuates, hospital 1's larger sample size makes it less likely to have extreme variations from the 50% average. This means it's more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born is over 60%.
