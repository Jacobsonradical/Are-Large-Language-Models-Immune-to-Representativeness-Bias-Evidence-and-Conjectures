{hospital: 3}

To determine which hospital recorded more days with over 60% baby boys, we need to consider the sample size (number of babies born) at each hospital.

At hospital 1, with 45 babies born per day, the sample size is larger. With a larger sample size, the proportion of baby boys is more likely to be closer to the expected 50%. Deviations from 50% become less likely as the sample size increases.

At hospital 2, with only 15 babies born per day, the sample size is smaller. With a smaller sample size, the proportion of baby boys can fluctuate more easily, and deviations from 50% (including values over 60%) are more likely to occur by chance.

Therefore, while hospital 2 has a higher chance of recording a single day with over 60% baby boys due to the smaller sample size, over the course of a year, the number of such days is likely to be similar for both hospitals, within a 5% range.

The larger sample size at hospital 1 and the smaller sample size at hospital 2 tend to balance each other out, leading to a comparable number of days with over 60% baby boys at both hospitals.
