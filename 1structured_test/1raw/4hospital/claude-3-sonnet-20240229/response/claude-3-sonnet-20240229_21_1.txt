{hospital: 3}

The probability of having more than 60% boys in a given day follows a binomial distribution, which depends on the number of trials (the number of babies born) and the probability of success (0.5 for boys). 

For hospital 1, with 45 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys is approximately 0.205 or 20.5%.

For hospital 2, with 15 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys is approximately 0.174 or 17.4%.

While the probability is slightly higher for hospital 1, the difference is not significant enough to conclude that one hospital will have substantially more days with more than 60% boys over a period of one year.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the number of days with more than 60% boys will be about the same (within 5% of each other) for both hospitals over the course of a year.
