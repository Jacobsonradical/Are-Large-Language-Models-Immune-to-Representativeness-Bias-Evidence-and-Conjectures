To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution, which models the probability of successes (in this case, boys being born) in a fixed number of independent trials (births).

Given:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies born per day, with a probability of around 0.5 for a boy.
- Hospital 2: 15 babies born per day, with a probability of around 0.5 for a boy.
- We want to find the probability of more than 60% boys being born on a given day.

The probability of having more than 60% boys in Hospital 1 (with 45 births per day) is higher than in Hospital 2 (with 15 births per day) because the larger sample size in Hospital 1 makes the probability distribution narrower and more concentrated around the mean value of 0.5.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys being born.
