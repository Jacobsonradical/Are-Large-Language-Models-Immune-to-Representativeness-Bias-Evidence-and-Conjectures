To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution. The number of baby boys born in a hospital on a given day follows a binomial distribution, where the number of trials (n) is the total number of babies born, and the probability of success (p) is 0.5 (assuming an equal probability of having a boy or a girl).

The probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the binomial distribution.

Let's calculate the probability for each hospital:

Hospital 1:
n = 45 (number of babies born per day)
p = 0.5 (probability of having a boy)
We want to find the probability of having more than 0.6 * 45 = 27 boys.
P(X > 27) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27) = 1 - sum(binomial(45, k, 0.5)) for k = 0 to 27
P(X > 27) ≈ 0.1696 or 16.96%

Hospital 2:
n = 15 (number of babies born per day)
p = 0.5 (probability of having a boy)
We want to find the probability of having more than 0.6 * 15 = 9 boys.
P(X > 9) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9) = 1 - sum(binomial(15, k, 0.5)) for k = 0 to 9
P(X > 9) ≈ 0.1673 or 16.73%

Since the probabilities are very close (within 5% of each other), we can conclude that the hospitals are likely to record a similar number of days with more than 60% boys.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 3}
