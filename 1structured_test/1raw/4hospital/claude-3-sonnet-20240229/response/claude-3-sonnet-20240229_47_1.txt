To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of probability and the binomial distribution.

Given:
- Hospital 1: About 45 babies are born each day.
- Hospital 2: About 15 babies are born each day.
- The probability of a baby being a boy is approximately 0.5 (50%).

For a day to have more than 60% boys, the number of boys born must exceed 60% of the total number of births.

In Hospital 1, with 45 births per day:
- For more than 60% boys, we need at least 27 boys (0.6 × 45 = 27).
- The probability of having 27 or more boys out of 45 births, with a probability of 0.5 for each birth, is relatively small (about 0.16 or 16%).

In Hospital 2, with 15 births per day:
- For more than 60% boys, we need at least 9 boys (0.6 × 15 = 9).
- The probability of having 9 or more boys out of 15 births, with a probability of 0.5 for each birth, is higher (about 0.35 or 35%).

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys due to the smaller sample size (15 births per day).
