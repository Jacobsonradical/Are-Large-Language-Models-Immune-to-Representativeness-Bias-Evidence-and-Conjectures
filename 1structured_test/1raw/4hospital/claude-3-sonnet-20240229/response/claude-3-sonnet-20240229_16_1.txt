To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probabilities of observing more than 60% boys in each hospital, given the number of daily births.

Let's define the following:
- p: the probability of a baby being a boy (assumed to be 0.5)
- q: the probability of a baby being a girl (1 - p = 0.5)
- n1: the number of daily births in hospital 1 (45)
- n2: the number of daily births in hospital 2 (15)

The probability of observing more than 60% boys in a given day can be calculated using the binomial probability distribution.

For hospital 1 (n1 = 45):
P(more than 60% boys) = 1 - P(at most 60% boys)
                      = 1 - sum(k=0 to 27) (45 choose k) * p^k * q^(45-k)
                      = 0.1461 (approximately)

For hospital 2 (n2 = 15):
P(more than 60% boys) = 1 - P(at most 60% boys)
                      = 1 - sum(k=0 to 9) (15 choose k) * p^k * q^(15-k)
                      = 0.2871 (approximately)

Since hospital 2 has a higher probability of observing more than 60% boys on a given day, it is expected to record more such days over a year.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 2}
