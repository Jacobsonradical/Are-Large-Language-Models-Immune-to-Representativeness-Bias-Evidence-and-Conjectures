To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day for each hospital, and then compare the probabilities to determine which hospital is more likely to record more such days.

Given:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies born per day.
- Hospital 2: 15 babies born per day.
- The probability of having a boy is approximately 0.5.

Let's assume that the number of boys born on a given day follows a binomial distribution, where the probability of success (having a boy) is 0.5 for each birth.

For Hospital 1:
- Number of trials (births) = 45
- Probability of success (having a boy) = 0.5

We want to find the probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45) for Hospital 1.
P(X > 27) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27), where X is the number of boys born.

For Hospital 2:
- Number of trials (births) = 15
- Probability of success (having a boy) = 0.5

We want to find the probability of having more than 9 boys (60% of 15) for Hospital 2.
P(X > 9) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9), where X is the number of boys born.

Using a binomial probability calculator or statistical software, we can compute these probabilities:

P(X > 27) for Hospital 1 ≈ 0.1414 (approximately 14.14%)
P(X > 9) for Hospital 2 ≈ 0.1537 (approximately 15.37%)

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day is slightly higher for Hospital 2, we can expect that Hospital 2 is more likely to record more such days over a period of one year.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 2}
