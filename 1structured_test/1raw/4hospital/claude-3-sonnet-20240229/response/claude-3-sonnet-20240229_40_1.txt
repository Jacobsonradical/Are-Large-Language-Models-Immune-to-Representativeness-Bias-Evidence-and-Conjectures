{hospital: 3}

To explain:

1) For hospital 1, with about 45 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys on any given day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

2) For hospital 2, with about 15 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys on any given day can also be calculated using the binomial distribution.

3) While the probability for any specific day may differ between the two hospitals due to the different number of births, over the course of a year (365 days), the number of days with more than 60% boys should be roughly proportional to the number of births.

4) Hospital 1 has about 45/60 = 0.75 times more births per day compared to hospital 2.

5) Therefore, we would expect hospital 1 to have roughly 0.75 times more days with more than 60% boys compared to hospital 2.

6) Since the difference is within 5% of each other, the appropriate answer is that they are about the same (within 5% of each other).

So the hospitals should record a similar number of days with more than 60% boys over the course of a year, given the assumptions in the problem statement.
