{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. The percentage of baby boys born each day is subject to random variation, following a binomial distribution.
2. For hospital 1, with an average of 45 births per day, the standard deviation of the percentage of baby boys is approximately sqrt(0.5 * 0.5 / 45) = 0.074 or 7.4%.
3. For hospital 2, with an average of 15 births per day, the standard deviation of the percentage of baby boys is approximately sqrt(0.5 * 0.5 / 15) = 0.129 or 12.9%.
4. The probability of observing more than 60% baby boys on any given day is higher for hospital 2 due to the larger standard deviation.
5. However, over the course of a year (365 days), the number of days with more than 60% baby boys is expected to be roughly proportional to the number of births.
6. Hospital 1 has about 45/15 = 3 times as many births as hospital 2.
7. Therefore, the expected number of days with more than 60% baby boys is likely to be similar for the two hospitals, within a 5% range.

While hospital 2 may have a slightly higher chance of recording such days on any given day, the larger number of births at hospital 1 should balance it out over a year. Hence, my answer is that the two hospitals are likely to record a similar number of days with more than 60% baby boys, within a 5% range.
