To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of observing more than 60% boys in a given number of births, assuming a 50% probability of having a boy or a girl for each birth.

For hospital 1 with 45 babies born per day, the probability of observing more than 60% boys (i.e., 28 or more boys) is approximately 0.177 or 17.7%.

For hospital 2 with 15 babies born per day, the probability of observing more than 60% boys (i.e., 10 or more boys) is approximately 0.205 or 20.5%.

Since hospital 2 has a higher probability of observing more than 60% boys on a given day due to the smaller number of births, it is more likely to record more days with this occurrence over a year.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 2}
