{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. The probability of having more than 60% boys on any given day is the same for both hospitals, regardless of the number of births. This is because each birth has a 50% chance of being a boy, and the outcomes are independent events.

2. The more births there are, the closer the percentage of boys will be to the expected 50%. This is due to the law of large numbers.

3. Since hospital 1 has about 45 births per day and hospital 2 has about 15 births per day, the percentage of boys in hospital 1 will tend to be closer to 50% on any given day compared to hospital 2.

4. Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have days with more than 60% boys than hospital 1, but the difference is not expected to be very large.

5. Without more specific information about the distributions, it's reasonable to assume that the number of days with more than 60% boys will be similar for both hospitals, within a 5% difference.

Hence, my answer is that the two hospitals are about the same in terms of the number of days with more than 60% boys born.
