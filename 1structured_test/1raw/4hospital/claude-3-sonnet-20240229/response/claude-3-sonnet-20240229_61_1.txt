{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. The expected number of births in hospital 1 is higher (45 per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 per day).
2. However, the probability of having more than 60% boys on any given day is determined by the binomial distribution, which depends on the number of trials (births) and the probability of success (boy) in each trial.
3. For hospital 1, with 45 births per day and a 50% chance of a boy, the probability of having more than 60% boys (27 or more out of 45) is around 16.4%.
4. For hospital 2, with 15 births per day and a 50% chance of a boy, the probability of having more than 60% boys (9 or more out of 15) is around 16.8%.
5. Since the probabilities are very close, over a period of 1 year (365 days), the number of days with more than 60% boys is likely to be similar for both hospitals, within a 5% margin.

Therefore, I believe that the number of days with more than 60% boys recorded by the two hospitals will be about the same (within 5% of each other).
