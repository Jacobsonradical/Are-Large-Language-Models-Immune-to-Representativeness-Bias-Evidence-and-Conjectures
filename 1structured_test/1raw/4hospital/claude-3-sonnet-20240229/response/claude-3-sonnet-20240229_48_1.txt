To solve this problem, we need to consider the probabilities involved and the sample sizes (number of babies born) in each hospital.

Given information:
- Hospital 1: Approximately 45 babies are born each day.
- Hospital 2: Approximately 15 babies are born each day.
- The overall probability of having a boy is around 50%, but it varies from day to day.

We want to determine which hospital is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of babies being boys.

The probability of having more than 60% boys in a given day depends on the sample size (number of babies born) and follows a binomial distribution.

For a larger sample size (like in Hospital 1), the probability of observing a significant deviation from the expected 50% is lower due to the law of large numbers.

On the other hand, for a smaller sample size (like in Hospital 2), the probability of observing a significant deviation from the expected 50% is higher due to the larger relative impact of random fluctuations.

Therefore, Hospital 2 (with a smaller sample size of 15 babies per day) is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of babies being boys compared to Hospital 1 (with a larger sample size of 45 babies per day).
