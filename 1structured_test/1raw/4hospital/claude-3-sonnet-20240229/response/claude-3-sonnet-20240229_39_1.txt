{hospital: 3}

To determine which hospital is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys, we need to consider the sample size (number of babies born) at each hospital.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size with 45 babies born per day, while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size with 15 babies born per day.

When the sample size is larger, the observed proportion of boys is more likely to be closer to the expected 50% due to the law of large numbers. Smaller sample sizes are more prone to deviating from the expected proportion due to random fluctuations.

Therefore, Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, is more likely to have days where the observed proportion of boys deviates significantly from 50%, including days where the proportion exceeds 60%.

However, since the difference in sample sizes is not extremely large, the likelihood of recording more than 60% boys on a given day is not drastically different between the two hospitals.

As a result, it is reasonable to assume that the number of days with more than 60% boys recorded at each hospital is likely to be similar, within a 5% difference.
