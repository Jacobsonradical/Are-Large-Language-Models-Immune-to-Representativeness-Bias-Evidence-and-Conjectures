To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probability of having more than 60% boys born on any given day for each hospital.

Given:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies born per day, on average.
- Hospital 2: 15 babies born per day, on average.
- The probability of having a boy is 0.5 (50%).

The probability of having more than 60% boys out of n births follows a binomial distribution with n trials and a success probability of 0.5.

For Hospital 1 (n = 45):
The probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45) is approximately 0.158.

For Hospital 2 (n = 15):
The probability of having more than 9 boys (60% of 15) is approximately 0.199.

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys is higher for Hospital 2 (with fewer births per day), we can expect Hospital 2 to record more days with more than 60% boys born.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
