To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution, which models the probability of success in a series of independent trials with the same probability of success in each trial.

In this case, the "trials" are the births of babies, and "success" is a baby being a boy. The probability of having a boy is assumed to be 0.5 (50%).

The number of boys born on a given day follows a binomial distribution with parameters:
- n: the number of trials (total number of babies born)
- p: the probability of success (0.5 for having a boy)

For hospital 1, n = 45 (babies born per day)
For hospital 2, n = 15 (babies born per day)

The probability of having more than 60% boys (27 or more out of 45 for hospital 1, and 9 or more out of 15 for hospital 2) is higher for hospital 2 because of the smaller sample size (15 births per day).

Therefore, we can expect hospital 2 to record more days with more than 60% boys born.
