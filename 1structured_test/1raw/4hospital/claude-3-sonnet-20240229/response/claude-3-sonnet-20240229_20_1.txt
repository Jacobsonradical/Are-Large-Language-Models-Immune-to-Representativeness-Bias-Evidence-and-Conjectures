To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day.

Given:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies born per day.
- Hospital 2: 15 babies born per day.
- The probability of a baby being a boy is approximately 50%.

Let's calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys for each hospital using the binomial distribution.

For Hospital 1 (45 babies per day):
The probability of having more than 60% boys (27 or more boys out of 45 babies) is approximately 0.235 or 23.5%.

For Hospital 2 (15 babies per day):
The probability of having more than 60% boys (9 or more boys out of 15 babies) is approximately 0.346 or 34.6%.

Since Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day, we can expect that Hospital 2 recorded more such days over the course of a year.

Therefore, my answer is:
{hospital: 2}
