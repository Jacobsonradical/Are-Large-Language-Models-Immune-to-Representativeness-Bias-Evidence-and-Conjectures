{hospital: 2}

Here's my reasoning:

1. Hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies).
2. The question asks about the number of days when more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
3. For a larger sample size (like Hospital 1), the percentage of boys born is likely to be closer to the expected value of 50%. Deviations from 50% become less likely as the sample size increases.
4. For a smaller sample size (like Hospital 2), the percentage of boys born is more likely to deviate from 50% on any given day due to random fluctuations.
5. Therefore, it is more likely for Hospital 2 to have a higher number of days when the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%, compared to Hospital 1.

However, it's important to note that this is just a probabilistic reasoning, and the actual recorded data may differ from these expectations due to random variations.
