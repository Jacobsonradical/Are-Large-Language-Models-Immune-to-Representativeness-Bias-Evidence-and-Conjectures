To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day for each hospital.

Let's first calculate the expected number of boys born per day in each hospital:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies × 0.5 = 22.5 boys (on average)
- Hospital 2: 15 babies × 0.5 = 7.5 boys (on average)

Now, we can use the binomial probability distribution to calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day.

For Hospital 1:
- Number of trials (babies born) = 45
- Probability of success (boy) = 0.5
- We want the probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45)

Using a binomial calculator or the formula, we get the probability of having more than 27 boys in Hospital 1 as approximately 0.2315 or 23.15%.

For Hospital 2:
- Number of trials (babies born) = 15
- Probability of success (boy) = 0.5
- We want the probability of having more than 9 boys (60% of 15)

Using a binomial calculator or the formula, we get the probability of having more than 9 boys in Hospital 2 as approximately 0.2588 or 25.88%.

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day is higher for Hospital 2 than for Hospital 1, we can expect Hospital 2 to record more such days over a year.

Therefore, my answer is:
{hospital: 2}
