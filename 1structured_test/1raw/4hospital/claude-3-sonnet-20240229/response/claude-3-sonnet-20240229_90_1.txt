To solve this problem, we need to analyze the likelihood of having more than 60% boys born on a given day for each hospital, based on the provided information.

Given:
- Hospital 1: About 45 babies are born each day.
- Hospital 2: About 15 babies are born each day.
- The overall probability of having a boy is approximately 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day depends on the number of births and follows a binomial distribution.

For Hospital 1, with 45 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (27 or more boys out of 45 births) is approximately 28.6%.

For Hospital 2, with 15 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (9 or more boys out of 15 births) is approximately 27.2%.

Since the probabilities are relatively close, we can conclude that both hospitals are likely to record a similar number of days with more than 60% boys born over the course of a year.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 3}
