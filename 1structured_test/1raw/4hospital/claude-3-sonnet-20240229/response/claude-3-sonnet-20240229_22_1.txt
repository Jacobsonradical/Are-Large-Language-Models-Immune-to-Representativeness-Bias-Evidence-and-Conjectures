{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. The percentage of baby boys born each day follows a binomial distribution, with the probability of success (having a boy) being around 0.5.

2. For hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, the standard deviation of the number of boys born each day is approximately sqrt(45 * 0.5 * 0.5) = 3.35.

3. For hospital 2, with about 15 babies born each day, the standard deviation of the number of boys born each day is approximately sqrt(15 * 0.5 * 0.5) = 1.94.

4. The probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., more than 27 out of 45 for hospital 1, and more than 9 out of 15 for hospital 2) is roughly the same for both hospitals, as the number of standard deviations from the mean is similar (around 2.5 standard deviations).

5. Therefore, over the course of a year, we would expect both hospitals to record a similar number of days with more than 60% boys, within a 5% margin of error.

Hence, I believe the answer is 3, indicating that the two hospitals are likely to have recorded about the same number of days with more than 60% boys.
