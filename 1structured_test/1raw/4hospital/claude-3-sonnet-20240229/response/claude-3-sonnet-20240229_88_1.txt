{hospital: 3}

To analyze this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day for each hospital.

For hospital 1, with 45 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 28 or more boys) can be calculated using the binomial distribution. This probability is approximately 0.211 or 21.1%.

For hospital 2, with 15 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 9 or more boys) is approximately 0.220 or 22.0%.

While the probability is slightly higher for hospital 2, the difference is not significant enough to conclude that one hospital would consistently record more days with more than 60% boys over a year-long period.

Given that the probabilities are within a few percentage points of each other, it is reasonable to assume that the number of days recorded by each hospital with more than 60% boys would be about the same, within a 5% margin.

Therefore, the answer is {hospital: 3}, indicating that the two hospitals are likely to record a similar number of days (within 5% of each other) with more than 60% boys born.
