{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. The probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day is solely based on the total number of babies born that day, and not the hospital itself.

2. For hospital 1, with an average of 45 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 28 or more boys out of 45 babies) is around 16%.

3. For hospital 2, with an average of 15 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 10 or more boys out of 15 babies) is around 18%.

4. While the probability is slightly higher for hospital 2 due to the smaller sample size, the difference in probabilities is not significant enough to conclude that one hospital would record substantially more days with more than 60% boys over a one-year period.

5. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the number of days with more than 60% boys would be roughly the same (within 5% of each other) for both hospitals over a one-year period.
