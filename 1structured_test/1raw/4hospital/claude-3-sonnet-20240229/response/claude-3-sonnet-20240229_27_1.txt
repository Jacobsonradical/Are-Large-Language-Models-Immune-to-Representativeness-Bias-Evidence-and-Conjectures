{hospital: 3}

To determine which hospital is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% male births, we need to consider the probability of observing such an event for each hospital, which depends on the number of births per day.

For hospital 1, with an average of 45 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% male births on a given day can be calculated using the binomial distribution. Assuming a 50% probability of a male birth, the probability of having more than 27 male births (60% of 45) is approximately 0.242 or 24.2%.

For hospital 2, with an average of 15 births per day, the probability of having more than 9 male births (60% of 15) is approximately 0.205 or 20.5%.

While the probability is slightly higher for hospital 1, the difference is relatively small (around 3.7%). Additionally, these probabilities assume a fixed 50% probability of male births, but in reality, this percentage can vary from day to day.

Given the relatively small difference in probabilities and the potential variability in the male birth percentage, it is reasonable to assume that the number of days with over 60% male births would be similar for both hospitals, within a 5% margin of error.

Therefore, the answer {hospital: 3} suggests that the two hospitals are likely to have recorded a similar number of days with over 60% male births, within a 5% difference.
