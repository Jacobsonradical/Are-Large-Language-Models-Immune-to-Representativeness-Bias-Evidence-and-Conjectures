To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution. In this case, we have a series of independent trials (births) with two possible outcomes (boy or girl), and a constant probability (around 50%) for each trial.

The probability of observing more than 60% boys in a given day follows a binomial distribution with parameters n (number of births) and p (probability of a boy birth, around 0.5).

For hospital 1, with an average of 45 births per day, the probability of observing more than 60% boys (27 or more boys) on a given day is approximately 0.2277 or 22.77%.

For hospital 2, with an average of 15 births per day, the probability of observing more than 60% boys (9 or more boys) on a given day is approximately 0.2927 or 29.27%.

Since hospital 2 has a higher daily probability of observing more than 60% boys, it is more likely to record more such days over the course of a year.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 2}
