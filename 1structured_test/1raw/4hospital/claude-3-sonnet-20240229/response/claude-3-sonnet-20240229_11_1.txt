To determine which hospital recorded more days with more than 60% of babies born as boys, we need to consider the sample size (number of births) at each hospital.

In hospital 1, with 45 births per day, the expected number of boys (assuming 50% chance) is 45 * 0.5 = 22.5.

For the percentage of boys to exceed 60%, the number of boys born needs to be greater than 0.6 * 45 = 27. This requires a deviation of at least 4.5 from the expected value of 22.5, which is less likely to occur with a larger sample size.

In hospital 2, with 15 births per day, the expected number of boys is 15 * 0.5 = 7.5.

For the percentage of boys to exceed 60%, the number of boys born needs to be greater than 0.6 * 15 = 9. This requires a deviation of at least 1.5 from the expected value of 7.5, which is more likely to occur with a smaller sample size.

Therefore, hospital 2, with a smaller number of births per day, is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% of babies born as boys.
