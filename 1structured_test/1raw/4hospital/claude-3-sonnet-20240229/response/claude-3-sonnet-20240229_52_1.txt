{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. The probability of having more than 60% boys in a given day follows a binomial distribution.
2. For hospital 1, with 45 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (27 or more out of 45) is around 0.184 or 18.4%.
3. For hospital 2, with 15 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (9 or more out of 15) is around 0.179 or 17.9%.
4. The difference between these two probabilities (18.4% - 17.9% = 0.5%) is relatively small.
5. Over the course of a year (365 days), the expected number of days with more than 60% boys for hospital 1 is approximately 365 * 0.184 = 67 days.
6. For hospital 2, the expected number of days with more than 60% boys is approximately 365 * 0.179 = 65 days.
7. The difference between these expected values (67 - 65 = 2 days) is relatively small compared to the total number of days in a year.

Therefore, based on the given information and the binomial probability calculations, it is reasonable to assume that the two hospitals would record a similar number of days (within 5% of each other) where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
