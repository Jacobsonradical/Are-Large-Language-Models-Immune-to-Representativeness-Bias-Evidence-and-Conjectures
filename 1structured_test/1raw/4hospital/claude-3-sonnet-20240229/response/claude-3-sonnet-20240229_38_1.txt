{hospital: 3}

To explain my answer:

Given the information that in hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, and in hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day, we can calculate the expected number of days in a year when more than 60% of the babies born were boys for each hospital.

For hospital 1:
Since the expected percentage of baby boys is 50%, the expected number of baby boys born per day is 45 * 0.5 = 22.5.
For more than 60% of the babies to be boys, we need at least 45 * 0.6 = 27 baby boys.
The probability of having 27 or more baby boys out of 45 births, assuming a binomial distribution, is approximately 0.16 or 16%.
Therefore, the expected number of days in a year when more than 60% of the babies born were boys in hospital 1 is 0.16 * 365 = 58.4 days.

For hospital 2:
Since the expected percentage of baby boys is 50%, the expected number of baby boys born per day is 15 * 0.5 = 7.5.
For more than 60% of the babies to be boys, we need at least 15 * 0.6 = 9 baby boys.
The probability of having 9 or more baby boys out of 15 births, assuming a binomial distribution, is approximately 0.17 or 17%.
Therefore, the expected number of days in a year when more than 60% of the babies born were boys in hospital 2 is 0.17 * 365 = 62.05 days.

The difference between the expected number of days for hospital 1 and hospital 2 is 62.05 - 58.4 = 3.65 days, which is within 5% of each other.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the two hospitals recorded about the same number of days (within 5% of each other) on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
