To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of observing more than 60% boys on a given day for each hospital, and then compare the expected number of such days for each hospital over the course of a year.

Given information:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies born per day.
- Hospital 2: 15 babies born per day.
- The probability of having a boy is approximately 0.5 (50%).

The probability of observing more than 60% boys on a given day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For Hospital 1 (45 babies per day):
- The probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45) out of 45 babies is approximately 0.2753.

For Hospital 2 (15 babies per day):
- The probability of having more than 9 boys (60% of 15) out of 15 babies is approximately 0.1788.

Over the course of a year (365 days):
- Expected number of days with more than 60% boys for Hospital 1: 365 × 0.2753 ≈ 100 days.
- Expected number of days with more than 60% boys for Hospital 2: 365 × 0.1788 ≈ 65 days.

The difference between the expected number of days is approximately 35, which is greater than 5% of the larger value (100).

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
