To answer this question, we need to analyze the probability of observing more than 60% boys born on a given day at each hospital.

Let's assume that the probability of a baby being a boy is 0.5 (50%).

For hospital 1 with 45 births per day:
- The probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 28 or more boys) is approximately 0.2116 or 21.16%.

For hospital 2 with 15 births per day:
- The probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 9 or more boys) is approximately 0.2088 or 20.88%.

Since the probabilities are very close (within 0.28% of each other), we can expect that over a period of 1 year, both hospitals will record a similar number of days with more than 60% boys born.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 3}
