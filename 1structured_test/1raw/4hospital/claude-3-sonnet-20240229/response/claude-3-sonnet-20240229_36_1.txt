To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day at each hospital.

Let's start with hospital 1, where 45 babies are born each day.

The probability of having a boy is 0.5 (50%).
The expected number of boys born at hospital 1 each day is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5.
For more than 60% of the babies to be boys, we need at least 27 boys (60% of 45 is 27).

Using the binomial distribution formula, we can calculate the probability of having 27 or more boys born at hospital 1 on a given day:

P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - P(X ≤ 26)
           = 1 - Σ(k=0 to 26) (45 choose k) × (0.5)^k × (0.5)^(45-k)
           ≈ 0.2143 or 21.43%

Now, let's consider hospital 2, where 15 babies are born each day.

The expected number of boys born at hospital 2 each day is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.
For more than 60% of the babies to be boys, we need at least 9 boys (60% of 15 is 9).

Using the binomial distribution formula again, we can calculate the probability of having 9 or more boys born at hospital 2 on a given day:

P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - P(X ≤ 8)
          = 1 - Σ(k=0 to 8) (15 choose k) × (0.5)^k × (0.5)^(15-k)
          ≈ 0.1831 or 18.31%

The probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day is higher at hospital 1 (21.43%) compared to hospital 2 (18.31%).

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 1}
