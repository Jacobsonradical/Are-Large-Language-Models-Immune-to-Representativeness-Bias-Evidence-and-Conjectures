{hospital: 3}

Assuming that the percentage of baby boys born varies randomly from day to day, and that the two hospitals have no specific factors that would influence the gender ratio, the number of days with more than 60% baby boys should be approximately proportional to the number of babies born.

Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born per day, which is three times as many as Hospital 2 with 15 babies born per day.

Therefore, if we consider a large enough period (like one year), the number of days with more than 60% baby boys should be roughly three times higher for Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2.

However, if we consider a smaller period, the random variation could cause the numbers to be closer together, potentially within 5% of each other.

Given the information provided, it is reasonable to assume that over the course of one year, the number of days with more than 60% baby boys for the two hospitals should be about the same, within a 5% difference.
