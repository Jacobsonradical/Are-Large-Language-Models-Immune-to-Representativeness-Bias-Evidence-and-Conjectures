To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of observing more than 60% boys in each hospital, given the number of births per day.

Let's define the following:
- n1 = number of babies born per day in hospital 1 = 45
- n2 = number of babies born per day in hospital 2 = 15
- p = probability of having a boy = 0.5

The probability of observing more than 60% boys in a sample of n births follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and p.

For hospital 1:
P(more than 60% boys | n1 = 45, p = 0.5) = 1 - P(at most 60% boys | n1 = 45, p = 0.5)
= 1 - sum(binomial(45, k, 0.5) for k in range(0, 28))
≈ 0.2373

For hospital 2:
P(more than 60% boys | n2 = 15, p = 0.5) = 1 - P(at most 60% boys | n2 = 15, p = 0.5)
= 1 - sum(binomial(15, k, 0.5) for k in range(0, 9))
≈ 0.1831

The probability of observing more than 60% boys is higher for hospital 1 (0.2373) than for hospital 2 (0.1831). Therefore, we would expect hospital 1 to record more days with more than 60% boys born.
