To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution. The number of boys born each day in a hospital follows a binomial distribution with parameters n (the number of trials, which is the total number of babies born) and p (the probability of success, which is the probability of a baby being born as a boy, around 0.5).

For hospital 1, n ≈ 45, and for hospital 2, n ≈ 15.

The probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day is higher when n is smaller, as the binomial distribution becomes more spread out for smaller values of n.

Therefore, we can expect that hospital 2, with a smaller number of births per day, is more likely to have more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
