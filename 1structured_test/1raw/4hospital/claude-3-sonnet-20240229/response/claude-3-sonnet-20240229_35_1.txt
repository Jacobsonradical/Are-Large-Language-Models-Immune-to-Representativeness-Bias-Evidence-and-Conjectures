To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution and its properties.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has an average of 45 births per day.
- Hospital 2 has an average of 15 births per day.
- The probability of having a boy is 0.5 (50%).
- We want to find the number of days when more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

The number of boys born on a particular day follows a binomial distribution with parameters n (total number of births) and p (probability of a boy birth, which is 0.5).

For hospital 1, with n = 45 and p = 0.5, the expected number of boy births is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5.
For hospital 2, with n = 15 and p = 0.5, the expected number of boy births is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.

To have more than 60% boys, we need at least 28 boys in hospital 1 (60% of 45) and at least 10 boys in hospital 2 (60% of 15).

The probability of having at least 28 boys in hospital 1 is lower than the probability of having at least 10 boys in hospital 2, due to the larger sample size (45 births) in hospital 1.

Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys born.
