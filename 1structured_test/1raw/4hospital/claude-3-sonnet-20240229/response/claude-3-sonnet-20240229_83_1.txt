{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. For a large number of births, the proportion of boys should be close to 50% due to the law of large numbers.
2. Hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15).
3. Over the course of a year, the total number of births in Hospital 1 will be much higher than in Hospital 2.
4. With a larger sample size (total births), the proportion of days with more than 60% boys should be closer to the expected value for Hospital 1.
5. Therefore, the number of days with more than 60% boys is likely to be similar for both hospitals, within a 5% range.

However, it's important to note that this is based on the assumption that the gender ratio follows the expected 50% for boys in the long run. If there are any systematic factors influencing the gender ratio in a particular hospital or region, then the conclusion could be different.
