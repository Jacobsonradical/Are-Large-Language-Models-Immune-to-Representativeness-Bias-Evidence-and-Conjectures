To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution. The number of boys born each day at a hospital follows a binomial distribution with parameters n (the total number of babies born) and p (the probability of a baby being a boy, which is 0.5 or 50%).

The probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula or a binomial calculator.

Let's consider hospital 1 with an average of 45 babies born per day:
- The probability of having more than 60% boys (27 or more out of 45) is approximately 0.1587 or 15.87%.

For hospital 2 with an average of 15 babies born per day:
- The probability of having more than 60% boys (9 or more out of 15) is approximately 0.1719 or 17.19%.

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys is slightly higher for hospital 2, we can expect that hospital 2 recorded more such days over the course of a year.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 2}
