To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% boys among the newborn babies in each hospital.

Let's assume that the probability of having a boy is 0.5 (50%) for each birth, which is a reasonable assumption given the information provided.

For hospital 1, where about 45 babies are born each day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 28 or more boys) can be calculated using the binomial distribution. This probability is approximately 0.1527 or 15.27%.

For hospital 2, where about 15 babies are born each day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 10 or more boys) is approximately 0.1207 or 12.07%.

Since hospital 1 has a higher probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day, we can expect that hospital 1 will record more such days over the course of a year.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 1}
