To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% boys for each hospital, given the number of babies born per day.

For hospital 1, with 45 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys follows a binomial distribution with n = 45 and p = 0.5 (assuming an equal probability of having a boy or a girl).

Using a binomial probability calculator or spreadsheet, we can find that the probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45) out of 45 births is approximately 0.1267 or 12.67%.

For hospital 2, with 15 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys follows a binomial distribution with n = 15 and p = 0.5.

The probability of having more than 9 boys (60% of 15) out of 15 births is approximately 0.1719 or 17.19%.

Since hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day, we can expect that it recorded more such days over the course of a year.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 2}
