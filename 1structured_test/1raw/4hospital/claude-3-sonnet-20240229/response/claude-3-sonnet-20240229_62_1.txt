To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution, which models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure).

In this case, we can consider the birth of a baby boy as a "success" and the birth of a baby girl as a "failure." The probability of a baby being a boy (success) is 0.5 or 50%.

The number of babies born in each hospital per day follows a binomial distribution with the following parameters:

Hospital 1:
- Number of trials (babies born per day) = 45
- Probability of success (baby boy) = 0.5

Hospital 2:
- Number of trials (babies born per day) = 15
- Probability of success (baby boy) = 0.5

We want to find the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day for each hospital. This is equivalent to finding the probability of having at least 28 boys (61% of 45) for hospital 1 and at least 10 boys (67% of 15) for hospital 2.

The probability of having at least 28 boys in hospital 1 is higher than the probability of having at least 10 boys in hospital 2. This is because the number of trials (babies born per day) is higher in hospital 1, which makes it more likely to observe a higher number of boys on a given day.

Therefore, we can expect hospital 1 to record more days with more than 60% baby boys compared to hospital 2.
