To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of probability and the binomial distribution.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The probability of a baby being a boy is approximately 0.5 (50%).

For a particular day, the number of baby boys born at each hospital follows a binomial distribution with:
- Hospital 1: n = 45, p = 0.5
- Hospital 2: n = 15, p = 0.5

We need to find the probability of having more than 60% boys (or more than 27 boys) for Hospital 1 and the probability of having more than 60% boys (or more than 9 boys) for Hospital 2.

Using a binomial calculator or the binomial distribution formula, we can calculate these probabilities:

Probability of more than 27 boys (out of 45) for Hospital 1: P(X > 27) ≈ 0.1085 or 10.85%
Probability of more than 9 boys (out of 15) for Hospital 2: P(X > 9) ≈ 0.1722 or 17.22%

Since Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day, it is likely that Hospital 2 recorded more such days over the course of a year.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 2}
