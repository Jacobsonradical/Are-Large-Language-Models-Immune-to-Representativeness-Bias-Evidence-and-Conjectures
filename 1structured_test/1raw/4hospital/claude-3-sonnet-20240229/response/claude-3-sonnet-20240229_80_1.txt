To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial probability distribution, which describes the probability of successes (boys) in a fixed number of trials (births), given a constant probability of success (0.5 or 50% for boys) in each trial.

The probability of having more than 60% boys in a given day can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula for each hospital.

For hospital 1 with 45 births per day:
The probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45) out of 45 births is relatively small, around 0.136 or 13.6%.

For hospital 2 with 15 births per day:
The probability of having more than 9 boys (60% of 15) out of 15 births is relatively higher, around 0.228 or 22.8%.

Since hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day, it is likely that hospital 2 recorded more such days over the course of a year.

Therefore, my answer is:
{hospital: 2}
