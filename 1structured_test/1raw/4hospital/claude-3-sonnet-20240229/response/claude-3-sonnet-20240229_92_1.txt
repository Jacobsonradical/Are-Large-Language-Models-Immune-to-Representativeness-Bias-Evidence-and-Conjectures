To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% boys in each hospital on a given day. This probability depends on the number of babies born in each hospital.

Let's calculate the probability for each hospital:

Hospital 1:
Number of babies born per day = 45
For more than 60% boys, we need at least 28 boys (0.6 × 45 ≈ 27, but we round up to the nearest integer).
The probability of having 28 or more boys out of 45 births can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula:
P(X ≥ 28) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27)
           = 1 - Σ((45 choose k) × (0.5)^k × (0.5)^(45-k)), where k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 27
           ≈ 0.1395 or 13.95%

Hospital 2:
Number of babies born per day = 15
For more than 60% boys, we need at least 9 boys (0.6 × 15 = 9).
The probability of having 9 or more boys out of 15 births can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula:
P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - P(X ≤ 8)
          = 1 - Σ((15 choose k) × (0.5)^k × (0.5)^(15-k)), where k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 8
          ≈ 0.1831 or 18.31%

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys is higher for Hospital 2 (18.31%) compared to Hospital 1 (13.95%), we can expect Hospital 2 to record more days with more than 60% boys born.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 2}
