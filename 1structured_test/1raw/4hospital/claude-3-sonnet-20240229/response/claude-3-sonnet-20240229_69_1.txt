To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution, which models the number of successes (boys) in a fixed number of independent trials (births), where each trial has a constant probability of success (0.5 for boys).

Given:
- Hospital 1: 45 births per day
- Hospital 2: 15 births per day
- The probability of having a boy is 0.5 (50%)

We want to find the probability of having more than 60% boys in each hospital.

For hospital 1, with 45 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., more than 27 boys) is relatively small because the sample size is large.

For hospital 2, with 15 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., more than 9 boys) is higher because the sample size is smaller, and random fluctuations are more likely to occur.

Therefore, it is more likely for hospital 2 to record more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
