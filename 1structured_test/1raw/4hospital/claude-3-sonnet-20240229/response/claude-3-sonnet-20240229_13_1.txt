{hospital: 3}

To explain the reasoning:

1. Both hospitals have a relatively large number of births per day (45 and 15, respectively), so the statistical fluctuations in the percentage of boys born should be relatively small.

2. The expected percentage of boys born is 50% for both hospitals, since the gender ratio at birth is generally close to 50-50.

3. While the percentage of boys born can vary from day to day, over a long period of one year, the fluctuations should average out, assuming there are no systematic differences between the two hospitals.

4. The larger the number of births, the smaller the expected fluctuations around the 50% mark. Hospital 1, with 45 births per day, should experience smaller fluctuations than Hospital 2, with 15 births per day.

5. However, the difference in the number of births per day (45 vs. 15) is not extremely large, so the fluctuations in the percentage of boys born should still be relatively small for both hospitals over a one-year period.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the number of days with more than 60% boys born would be similar (within 5% of each other) for both hospitals over the course of a year.
