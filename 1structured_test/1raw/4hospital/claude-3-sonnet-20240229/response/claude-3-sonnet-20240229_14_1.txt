{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. The probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day for hospital 1 (with 45 births per day) is slightly higher than for hospital 2 (with 15 births per day). This is because with a larger number of births, the observed percentage is less likely to deviate significantly from the expected 50%.

2. However, over the course of a year, with a large number of days, these probabilities should roughly even out for both hospitals.

3. Since the question states that the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, there is no reason to assume that one hospital would consistently have a higher or lower percentage of boys than the other.

4. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the number of days with more than 60% boys would be about the same (within 5% of each other) for both hospitals over a period of one year.

So, based on the given information, my answer is that the two hospitals are likely to have recorded a similar number of days with more than 60% boys (option 3).
