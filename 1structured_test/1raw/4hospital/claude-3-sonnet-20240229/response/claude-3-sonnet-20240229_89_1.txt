To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day for each hospital.

Given information:
- Hospital 1: About 45 babies are born each day.
- Hospital 2: About 15 babies are born each day.
- The probability of having a boy is around 50%, but it varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day depends on the number of births and the probability distribution of boys and girls.

For hospital 1 with 45 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (27 or more boys) is relatively higher compared to hospital 2 with 15 births per day, where having more than 60% boys (9 or more boys) is less likely.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys born.

Answer: {hospital: 1}
