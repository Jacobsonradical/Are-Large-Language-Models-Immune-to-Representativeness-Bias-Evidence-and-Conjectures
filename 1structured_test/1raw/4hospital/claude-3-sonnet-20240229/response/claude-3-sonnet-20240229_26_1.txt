To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of having more than 60% boys in a given number of births, assuming a 50% probability of having a boy for each birth.

For hospital 1, with 45 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 28 or more boys) can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula:

P(X ≥ 28) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27)

Using a binomial calculator or statistical software, we can find that this probability is approximately 0.2144 or 21.44%.

For hospital 2, with 15 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 10 or more boys) can be calculated similarly:

P(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9)

This probability is approximately 0.1719 or 17.19%.

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys is higher for hospital 1 than for hospital 2, we can expect hospital 1 to record more days with more than 60% boys over the course of a year.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 1}
