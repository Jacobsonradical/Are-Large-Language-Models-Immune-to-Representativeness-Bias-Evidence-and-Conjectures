{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. Both hospitals have a relatively large number of births per day (45 and 15), so the fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys due to random chance should be relatively small.

2. The expected percentage of baby boys is 50% for both hospitals. While the actual percentage may vary from day to day due to random chance, over a long period of 1 year, these fluctuations should average out.

3. Since the number of births per day at hospital 1 is three times that of hospital 2, the fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys should be smaller at hospital 1 due to the larger sample size.

4. However, the threshold of 60% is quite high, so even with the larger sample size at hospital 1, there should not be a significant difference in the number of days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the number of days with more than 60% baby boys would be similar (within 5% of each other) for both hospitals over a 1-year period.
