To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of observing more than 60% boys in a given day for each hospital, and then compare the expected number of such days for each hospital over the course of a year.

Given:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies born per day, on average.
- Hospital 2: 15 babies born per day, on average.
- The probability of a baby being a boy is around 50%.

Let's first calculate the probability of observing more than 60% boys for each hospital.

For Hospital 1 (45 babies per day):
The probability of observing more than 60% boys (i.e., 28 or more boys out of 45 babies) can be calculated using the binomial probability distribution.
P(X ≥ 28) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27), where X is the number of boys born.
P(X ≥ 28) ≈ 0.1286 (calculated using the binomial distribution)

For Hospital 2 (15 babies per day):
The probability of observing more than 60% boys (i.e., 10 or more boys out of 15 babies) can be calculated similarly.
P(X ≥ 10) ≈ 0.1149

Now, we can compare the expected number of days with more than 60% boys for each hospital over a year (365 days).

For Hospital 1:
Expected number of days with more than 60% boys = 365 × 0.1286 ≈ 47 days

For Hospital 2:
Expected number of days with more than 60% boys = 365 × 0.1149 ≈ 42 days

The difference between the expected number of days is not significant (47 - 42 = 5 days), so we can consider them to be about the same (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, the answer would be:

{hospital: 3}
