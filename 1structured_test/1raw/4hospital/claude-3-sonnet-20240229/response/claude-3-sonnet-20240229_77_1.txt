To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution, which models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure).

In this case, we can consider the birth of a baby boy as a "success" and the birth of a baby girl as a "failure." The probability of having a boy is 0.5 (50%).

Let's calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys in each hospital:

Hospital 1:
Number of births per day = 45
Probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27), where X follows a binomial distribution with n = 45 and p = 0.5.

Hospital 2:
Number of births per day = 15
Probability of having more than 9 boys (60% of 15) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9), where X follows a binomial distribution with n = 15 and p = 0.5.

Using a binomial calculator or statistical software, we can find these probabilities:

Probability of having more than 27 boys in hospital 1 ≈ 0.2143 (21.43%)
Probability of having more than 9 boys in hospital 2 ≈ 0.1719 (17.19%)

Since hospital 1 has a higher probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day, it is more likely to record more such days over the course of a year.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 1}
