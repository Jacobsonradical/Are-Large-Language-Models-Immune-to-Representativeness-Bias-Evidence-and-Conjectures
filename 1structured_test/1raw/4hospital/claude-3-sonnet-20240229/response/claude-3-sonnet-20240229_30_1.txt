To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of observing more than 60% boys in a given number of births, assuming a 50% chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth.

Let's calculate the probability for each hospital:

Hospital 1 (45 births per day):
The probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 28 or more boys) out of 45 births follows a binomial distribution with n = 45 and p = 0.5.

Using a binomial calculator or statistical software, we can find the probability of having 28 or more boys out of 45 births, which is approximately 0.1638 or 16.38%.

Hospital 2 (15 births per day):
The probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 10 or more boys) out of 15 births follows a binomial distribution with n = 15 and p = 0.5.

Using a binomial calculator or statistical software, we can find the probability of having 10 or more boys out of 15 births, which is approximately 0.1761 or 17.61%.

Since the probability of observing more than 60% boys is slightly higher for Hospital 2 compared to Hospital 1, we can expect that Hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% boys born.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 2}

However, it's important to note that the difference in probabilities is relatively small (16.38% vs. 17.61%), so the actual number of days recorded by each hospital may not differ significantly over a one-year period.
