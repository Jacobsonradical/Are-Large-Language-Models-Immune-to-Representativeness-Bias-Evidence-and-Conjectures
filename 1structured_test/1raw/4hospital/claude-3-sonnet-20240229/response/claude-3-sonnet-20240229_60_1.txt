To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of births and the probability of having more than 60% boys on any given day.

Given information:
- Hospital 1: About 45 babies are born each day.
- Hospital 2: About 15 babies are born each day.
- The probability of having a boy is approximately 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% boys in a given number of births can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For hospital 1 with 45 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (at least 28 boys out of 45 births) is approximately 0.246 or 24.6%.

For hospital 2 with 15 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (at least 10 boys out of 15 births) is approximately 0.284 or 28.4%.

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys is higher for hospital 2, it is more likely that hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% boys over the course of a year.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
