To answer this question, we need to consider the sample size (number of babies born) at each hospital. A larger sample size will lead to a more stable estimate of the proportion of boys born, while a smaller sample size will result in more variability in the observed proportion from day to day.

{hospital: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, which is a larger sample size than Hospital 2's 15 babies per day.

2. With a larger sample size, the observed proportion of boys born at Hospital 1 on any given day is less likely to deviate significantly from the overall population proportion of 50%.

3. Therefore, Hospital 1 is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, as it would require a larger deviation from the expected 50% proportion.

4. Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size of 15 babies per day, is more likely to experience greater variability in the observed proportion of boys born on any given day, making it more probable to have days where the proportion exceeds 60%.

Based on the sample size considerations, Hospital 1 is expected to have fewer days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys compared to Hospital 2.
