To answer this question, let's consider the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day at each hospital.

Hospital 1:
- About 45 babies are born each day.
- The probability of having a boy is 0.5 (50%).
- The number of boys born follows a binomial distribution with n = 45 and p = 0.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 28 or more boys) is approximately 0.147 or 14.7%.

Hospital 2:
- About 15 babies are born each day.
- The probability of having a boy is 0.5 (50%).
- The number of boys born follows a binomial distribution with n = 15 and p = 0.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 9 or more boys) is approximately 0.244 or 24.4%.

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys is higher for Hospital 2 (24.4%) compared to Hospital 1 (14.7%), we would expect Hospital 2 to record more days with more than 60% boys born.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
