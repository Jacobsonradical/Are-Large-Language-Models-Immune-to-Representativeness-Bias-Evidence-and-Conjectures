To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% boys in a given number of births, and how this probability varies with the number of births.

{hospital: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. For a large number of births, the percentage of boys will be closer to 50% due to the law of large numbers.
2. Hospital 1 has about 45 births per day, which is a larger number than Hospital 2's 15 births per day.
3. With a larger number of births, the probability of having more than 60% boys is lower for Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2.
4. Therefore, Hospital 1 is less likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% boys compared to Hospital 2.

However, it's important to note that this is based on probability calculations and assumptions. The actual recorded data from the hospitals may differ from this analysis due to random variations and other factors.
