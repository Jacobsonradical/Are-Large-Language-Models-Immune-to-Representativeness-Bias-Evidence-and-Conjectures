To answer this question, we need to consider the probabilities involved and the sample sizes of the two hospitals.

{hospital: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day is higher when the sample size (number of births) is smaller.

2. Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 births per day, while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 births per day.

3. With a smaller sample size, the fluctuations in the proportion of boys will be larger, making it more likely for Hospital 2 to have days where over 60% of the babies born are boys, just by chance.

4. With a larger sample size, the proportion of boys will be closer to the expected 50% due to the law of large numbers, making it less likely for Hospital 1 to have days where over 60% of the babies born are boys.

Therefore, based on the sample sizes and the probabilities involved, it is more likely that Hospital 2 recorded more days with over 60% boys than Hospital 1, even though the expected percentage of boys is the same (50%) for both hospitals.
