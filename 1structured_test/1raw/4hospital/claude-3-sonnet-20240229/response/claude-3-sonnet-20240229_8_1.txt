{hospital: 3}

To determine which hospital recorded more days with over 60% baby boys, we need to consider the number of births at each hospital and the probabilities involved.

For hospital 1, with 45 births per day, the expected number of baby boys is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5. The probability of having more than 60% baby boys (i.e., 28 or more) can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For hospital 2, with 15 births per day, the expected number of baby boys is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5. The probability of having more than 60% baby boys (i.e., 10 or more) can also be calculated using the binomial distribution.

While the probability of having more than 60% baby boys on any given day is higher for hospital 2 due to the smaller sample size, the overall number of days with this occurrence should be similar for both hospitals because hospital 1 has a larger number of births per day.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the number of days with more than 60% baby boys would be about the same (within 5% of each other) for both hospitals over a period of one year.
