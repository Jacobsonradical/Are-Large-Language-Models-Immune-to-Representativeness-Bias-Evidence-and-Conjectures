To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of probability and the binomial distribution.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has an average of 45 births per day.
- Hospital 2 has an average of 15 births per day.
- The probability of having a boy is approximately 0.5 (50%).

The probability of having more than 60% boys in a given day follows the binomial distribution.

For hospital 1 with 45 births per day:
- The probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45) is relatively small.

For hospital 2 with 15 births per day:
- The probability of having more than 9 boys (60% of 15) is higher than for hospital 1.

This is because the binomial distribution with a smaller number of trials (births) has a higher probability of deviating significantly from the expected value.

Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% boys born.
