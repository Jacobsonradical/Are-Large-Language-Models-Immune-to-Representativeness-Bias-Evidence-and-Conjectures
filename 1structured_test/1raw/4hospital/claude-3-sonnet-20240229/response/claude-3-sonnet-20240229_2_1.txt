{hospital: 3}

To explain, the number of babies born per day at each hospital does not directly determine which hospital is more likely to have a higher proportion of days with over 60% boys born. The key factor is the total number of babies born at each hospital over the year.

At hospital 1, with 45 babies born per day, the total number of babies born in a year (assuming 365 days) would be approximately 45 * 365 = 16,425.

At hospital 2, with 15 babies born per day, the total number of babies born in a year would be approximately 15 * 365 = 5,475.

Since the total number of babies born at hospital 1 is about three times higher than at hospital 2, the fluctuations in the percentage of boys born on any given day would tend to average out more at hospital 1 due to the larger sample size.

Therefore, both hospitals are likely to have a similar proportion of days (within 5% of each other) where more than 60% of the babies born were boys, as the larger sample size at hospital 1 would compensate for the smaller number of babies born per day.
