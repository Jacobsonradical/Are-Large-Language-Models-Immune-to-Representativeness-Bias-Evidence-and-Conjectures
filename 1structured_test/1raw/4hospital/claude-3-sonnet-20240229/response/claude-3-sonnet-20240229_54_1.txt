{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1) For a large number of births, the percentage of boys born should be close to 50%, due to the law of large numbers.

2) Hospital 1 has a larger number of births per day (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies).

3) With a larger sample size, the percentage of boys born at Hospital 1 is likely to be closer to the expected 50% on most days.

4) Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size (15 babies per day), is more likely to have larger fluctuations from the expected 50% on any given day, resulting in a higher or lower percentage of boys born.

5) Therefore, both hospitals are expected to have a similar number of days where more than 60% of babies born were boys, within a 5% margin of error.

However, it's important to note that this is based on the assumption of a truly random process and a sufficiently large sample size at both hospitals over the course of a year.
