To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of probability and the binomial distribution.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has around 45 births per day.
- Hospital 2 has around 15 births per day.
- The probability of having a boy is approximately 0.5 (50%).

The probability of having more than 60% boys in a given day follows a binomial distribution.

For hospital 1 with 45 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (27 or more boys out of 45 births) is approximately 0.196 or 19.6%.

For hospital 2 with 15 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (9 or more boys out of 15 births) is approximately 0.209 or 20.9%.

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys is slightly higher for hospital 2 compared to hospital 1, we can expect hospital 2 to record more days with more than 60% boys.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 2}
