{hospital: 3}

To determine which hospital is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys, we need to consider the number of births at each hospital.

Hospital 1 has about 45 births per day, while Hospital 2 has about 15 births per day.

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day is higher when the number of births is smaller. This is because the fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys become more significant with a smaller sample size.

For example, in Hospital 2 with 15 births per day, having 9 or more baby boys (60% or higher) is more likely to occur by chance than in Hospital 1 with 45 births per day, where 27 or more baby boys (60% or higher) would be required.

However, the difference in the number of births between the two hospitals is not extremely large (45 vs. 15), and the specified range of "within 5% of each other" is relatively wide.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the two hospitals are likely to have recorded a similar number of days with over 60% baby boys, within a 5% margin of error. Hence, the answer is 3, indicating that they are about the same.
