{hospital: 2}

To calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day, we need to know the total number of babies born on that day. The hospital with fewer births will have a higher probability of exceeding the 60% threshold due to the smaller sample size.

In hospital 1, with 45 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (27 or more out of 45) is relatively low because the sample size is larger.

In hospital 2, with only 15 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (9 or more out of 15) is higher due to the smaller sample size.

Therefore, hospital 2, with fewer births per day, is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% boys born.
