To solve this problem, we need to consider the sample sizes (number of babies born) at each hospital and their impact on the likelihood of observing more than 60% boys on a given day.

Given:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies born per day
- Hospital 2: 15 babies born per day
- The overall probability of a baby being a boy is approximately 0.5 (50%)

For a small sample size (like 15 babies in Hospital 2), the probability of observing more than 60% boys by chance is higher compared to a larger sample size (like 45 babies in Hospital 1).

As the sample size increases, the observed proportion tends to converge towards the true population proportion (0.5 for boys).

Therefore, Hospital 2 with a smaller sample size is more likely to record a higher number of days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys, compared to Hospital 1 with a larger sample size.
