{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. The percentage of baby boys born on a given day follows a binomial distribution, which is approximately normal for large sample sizes.

2. For hospital 1, with around 45 births per day, the standard deviation of the percentage of baby boys is approximately sqrt((0.5 * 0.5) / 45) = 0.074 or 7.4%.

3. For hospital 2, with around 15 births per day, the standard deviation of the percentage of baby boys is approximately sqrt((0.5 * 0.5) / 15) = 0.129 or 12.9%.

4. The probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day is higher for the smaller hospital (hospital 2) due to the larger standard deviation.

5. However, the difference in the number of births per day is not large enough to make a significant difference in the number of days with more than 60% baby boys.

6. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the two hospitals will record a similar number of days with more than 60% baby boys, within a 5% margin of error.

Hence, my answer is 3, indicating that the two hospitals are likely to record about the same number of days with more than 60% baby boys.
