{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. The number of babies born per day at each hospital does not directly affect the probability of more than 60% being boys on a given day. The gender of each baby is an independent event.

2. The larger the number of babies born on a given day, the more likely the percentage of boys will be closer to the overall average of 50%. This is due to the law of large numbers.

3. With 45 babies born per day at hospital 1, and 15 babies born per day at hospital 2, the percentage of boys on a given day is likely to fluctuate more at hospital 2 due to the smaller sample size.

4. However, over the course of a year, these fluctuations should balance out for both hospitals, and the number of days with more than 60% boys should be roughly the same (within 5% of each other) for the two hospitals.

Therefore, based on the given information, it is reasonable to assume that the two hospitals recorded a similar number of days (within 5% of each other) with more than 60% baby boys born.
