To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of the binomial distribution.

The number of boys born each day in a hospital follows a binomial distribution with parameters n (the total number of babies born) and p (the probability of having a boy, which is assumed to be 0.5 on average).

The probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the binomial distribution.

For hospital 1, with n = 45 and p = 0.5, the probability of having more than 60% boys (27 or more boys out of 45) is approximately 0.2025 or 20.25%.

For hospital 2, with n = 15 and p = 0.5, the probability of having more than 60% boys (9 or more boys out of 15) is approximately 0.1892 or 18.92%.

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys is slightly higher for hospital 1, we can expect that hospital 1 would record more days with more than 60% boys over a period of one year.

However, the difference in probabilities is relatively small (1.33 percentage points), so the difference in the number of days recorded by the two hospitals may not be significant.

Therefore, my answer would be:

{hospital: 3}

Assuming that the difference in the number of days recorded by the two hospitals is within 5% of each other, which is a reasonable assumption given the small difference in probabilities.
