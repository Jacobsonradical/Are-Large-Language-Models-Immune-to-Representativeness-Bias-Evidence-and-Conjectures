{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. The expected number of babies born per day in hospital 1 is 45, and in hospital 2 is 15.
2. For a day to have more than 60% boys, the number of boys born needs to exceed the number of girls born by a certain margin.
3. This margin is higher for hospital 1 (with 45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (with 15 babies per day).
4. However, the probability of having more than 60% boys is solely determined by the underlying probability distribution (which is assumed to be the same for both hospitals), not by the total number of babies born.
5. Since the total number of days in a year is large, the difference in the number of days with more than 60% boys between the two hospitals is likely to be within 5% of each other.

Therefore, I believe that the number of days with more than 60% boys recorded by the two hospitals should be about the same (within 5% of each other).
