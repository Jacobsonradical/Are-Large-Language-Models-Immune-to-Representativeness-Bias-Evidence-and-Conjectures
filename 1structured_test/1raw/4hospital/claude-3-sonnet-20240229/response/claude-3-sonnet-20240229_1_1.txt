{hospital: 3}

To explain:

1. For a large number of births, the percentage of boys born should be close to 50% due to the laws of probability.

2. Hospital 1 has about 45 births per day, which is a reasonably large number.
   - Over a year, this is about 45 * 365 = 16,425 births.
   - With such a large sample size, the percentage of days where more than 60% boys were born is expected to be close for both hospitals.

3. Hospital 2 has about 15 births per day, which is a smaller number.
   - Over a year, this is about 15 * 365 = 5,475 births.
   - With this smaller sample size, there could be more fluctuations in the percentage of boys born each day due to randomness.

However, the question does not specify the exact number of days where more than 60% boys were born in each hospital. It simply asks which hospital recorded more such days.

Given the large sample sizes involved, and without any additional information, it is reasonable to assume that the percentage of days with more than 60% boys born would be similar (within 5% of each other) for both hospitals over a period of one year.

Therefore, the answer {hospital: 3} indicating that both hospitals recorded about the same number of days with more than 60% boys born is a reasonable choice.
