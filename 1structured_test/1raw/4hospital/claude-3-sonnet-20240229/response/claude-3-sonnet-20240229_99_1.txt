{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. The number of babies born per day at each hospital does not directly affect the probability of having a higher percentage of boys on a given day. The gender of each baby is an independent event with a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl.

2. For larger sample sizes (more births per day), the percentage of boys is more likely to be closer to 50%, while smaller sample sizes are more prone to larger deviations from 50%.

3. Hospital 1 has 45 births per day, which is a relatively large sample size, while Hospital 2 has 15 births per day, which is a smaller sample size.

4. With a smaller sample size, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from 50%, including days with more than 60% boys.

5. However, with a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to have a percentage of boys closer to 50%, making it less likely to have days with more than 60% boys.

6. Since the two sample sizes are not vastly different (45 vs. 15), the difference in the number of days with more than 60% boys is likely to be within a reasonable range, say 5%.

Therefore, based on the given information, it is reasonable to assume that the two hospitals recorded a similar number of days with more than 60% boys, within a 5% difference.
