To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of the binomial distribution, which models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure) with a constant probability of success.

In this case, we can consider the birth of a baby boy as a success, and the birth of a baby girl as a failure. The probability of having a boy is 0.5 (50%).

For hospital 1, with 45 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (≥ 28 boys) on a given day can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula or a binomial calculator.

For hospital 2, with 15 births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (≥ 10 boys) on a given day can also be calculated using the binomial distribution formula or a binomial calculator.

Since the number of births per day is higher for hospital 1, the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day is likely to be higher for hospital 1 compared to hospital 2.

Therefore, my answer is:
{hospital: 1}
