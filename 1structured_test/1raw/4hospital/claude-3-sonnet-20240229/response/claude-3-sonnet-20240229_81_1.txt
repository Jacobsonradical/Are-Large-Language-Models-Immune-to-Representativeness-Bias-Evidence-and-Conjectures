To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of probability and how it relates to the given scenario.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The probability of a baby being a boy is approximately 0.5 (50%).

To have more than 60% boys born on a particular day, we need to calculate the probability of this event for each hospital.

For Hospital 1 (with 45 babies per day):
The probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 28 or more boys) is relatively low because the number of births is reasonably large.

For Hospital 2 (with 15 babies per day):
The probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., 9 or more boys) is higher because the number of births is smaller, and random fluctuations have a more significant impact.

Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% boys born compared to Hospital 1.

Answer: {hospital: 2}
