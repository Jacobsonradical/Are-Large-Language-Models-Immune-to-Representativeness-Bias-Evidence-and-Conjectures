{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. The percentage of baby boys born each day is expected to follow a binomial distribution around 50%.
2. For hospital 1, with 45 babies born per day, the standard deviation of the binomial distribution is approximately √(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) ≈ 3.7.
3. For hospital 2, with 15 babies born per day, the standard deviation of the binomial distribution is approximately √(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) ≈ 2.2.
4. The probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day is slightly higher for hospital 2 due to the smaller sample size (and hence larger relative fluctuations).
5. However, the difference in probabilities is not very large, and over the course of a year (365 days), the number of days with more than 60% boys is expected to be roughly proportional to the number of babies born at each hospital.
6. Since hospital 1 has about 3 times as many births as hospital 2 (45/15 = 3), we can expect the number of days with more than 60% boys to be approximately the same for both hospitals, within a 5% margin of error.

Therefore, the most reasonable answer is that the two hospitals recorded about the same number of days with more than 60% baby boys, within a 5% margin of error.
