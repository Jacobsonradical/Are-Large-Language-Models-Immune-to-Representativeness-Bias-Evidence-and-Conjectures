To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of observing more than 60% boys in each hospital, given the number of births per day.

Let's assume that the probability of having a boy is 0.5 (50%) for each birth, which is a reasonable assumption given the information provided.

Hospital 1:
- Number of births per day: 45
- Probability of observing more than 60% boys (more than 27 boys out of 45 births) is relatively low, but not negligible.

Hospital 2:
- Number of births per day: 15
- Probability of observing more than 60% boys (more than 9 boys out of 15 births) is higher due to the smaller sample size.

Since the probability of observing more than 60% boys is higher for the hospital with fewer births (Hospital 2), we can expect Hospital 2 to record more days with more than 60% boys.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 2}
