{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1. The percentage of baby boys born each day is expected to fluctuate around the average of 50% for both hospitals.

2. For large sample sizes (like 45 babies per day for hospital 1 and 15 babies per day for hospital 2), the probability of observing more than 60% boys on any given day is relatively small, but it can still happen due to random variation.

3. Over the course of a year (365 days), both hospitals are likely to experience a similar number of days with more than 60% boys born, since the underlying probability of having a boy is the same (around 50%).

4. The difference in the number of babies born per day (45 vs. 15) should not significantly affect the overall probability of observing more than 60% boys on a given day, as long as the sample size is reasonably large (which is the case for both hospitals).

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the number of days with more than 60% boys born would be similar (within 5% of each other) for the two hospitals over the course of a year, given the same underlying probability of having a boy.
