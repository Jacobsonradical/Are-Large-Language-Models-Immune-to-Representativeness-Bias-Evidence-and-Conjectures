To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of probability and the binomial distribution.

Given:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies are born each day.
- Hospital 2: 15 babies are born each day.
- The probability of a baby being a boy is approximately 0.5 (50%).

We want to find the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day for each hospital.

For Hospital 1 (45 babies per day):
The probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., at least 28 boys) is relatively small since the expected number of boys is 0.5 × 45 = 22.5.

For Hospital 2 (15 babies per day):
The probability of having more than 60% boys (i.e., at least 10 boys) is higher since the expected number of boys is 0.5 × 15 = 7.5, which is closer to the threshold of 10.

Therefore, we can expect Hospital 2 to record more days with more than 60% boys born compared to Hospital 1.
