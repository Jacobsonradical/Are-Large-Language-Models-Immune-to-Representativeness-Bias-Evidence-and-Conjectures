{hospital: 3}

To analyze this problem, we need to understand the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day for each hospital.

For hospital 1, with 45 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys follows a binomial distribution with n = 45 and p = 0.5 (assuming a 50% chance of having a boy).

For hospital 2, with 15 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys also follows a binomial distribution with n = 15 and p = 0.5.

While the probabilities for individual days may differ slightly due to the different sample sizes, over the course of a year (365 days), the number of days with more than 60% boys should be roughly proportional to the number of births.

Since hospital 1 has three times as many births as hospital 2 (45 vs. 15 per day), the expected number of days with more than 60% boys would also be approximately three times higher for hospital 1.

However, the question asks if the difference is within 5% of each other. Given the large number of days in a year, it is reasonable to expect that the difference in the number of days with more than 60% boys would fall within 5% of each other for the two hospitals.

Therefore, the answer {hospital: 3} indicates that the two hospitals are likely to record a similar number of days with more than 60% boys (within 5% of each other) over the course of a year.
