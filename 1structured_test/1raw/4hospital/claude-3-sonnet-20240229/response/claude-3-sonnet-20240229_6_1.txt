{hospital: 3}

To explain my reasoning:

1) Hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies).

2) However, the percentage of baby boys born on a given day is a random variable that follows a binomial distribution.

3) For Hospital 1, with 45 births per day and a 50% probability of a baby being a boy, the standard deviation of the number of baby boys born on a given day is approximately sqrt(45 * 0.5 * 0.5) = 3.74 (using the formula for standard deviation of a binomial distribution).

4) For Hospital 2, with 15 births per day and a 50% probability of a baby being a boy, the standard deviation of the number of baby boys born on a given day is approximately sqrt(15 * 0.5 * 0.5) = 2.16.

5) The probability of having more than 60% baby boys (i.e., more than 27 out of 45 babies for Hospital 1, and more than 9 out of 15 babies for Hospital 2) is not significantly different between the two hospitals, given their respective standard deviations.

6) Therefore, while Hospital 1 has a larger sample size, the probability of exceeding the 60% threshold for baby boys on a given day is not substantially different between the two hospitals.

7) As a result, we can expect the number of days with more than 60% baby boys to be roughly the same (within 5% of each other) for both hospitals over a period of 1 year.

Hence, my answer is that the number of days with more than 60% baby boys is likely to be about the same (within 5% of each other) for both hospitals over the course of a year.
