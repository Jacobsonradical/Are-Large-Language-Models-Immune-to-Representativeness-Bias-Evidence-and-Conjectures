{hospital: 3}

Assuming that the percentage of baby boys born each day is random and independent of the hospital, the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day is the same for both hospitals.

For hospital 1, with an average of 45 babies per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys on a particular day is determined by the binomial distribution with n = 45 and p = 0.5 (assuming an equal probability of boys and girls).

For hospital 2, with an average of 15 babies per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys on a particular day is also determined by the binomial distribution, but with n = 15 and p = 0.5.

While the actual numbers of babies born per day may vary, the probability of having more than 60% boys should be approximately the same for both hospitals over a long period of one year, assuming no systematic differences between the hospitals.

Therefore, the expected number of days with more than 60% boys should be similar for both hospitals, within a 5% range of each other, given the large sample size of one year's worth of data.
