To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of the binomial distribution, which describes the probability of getting a certain number of successes (in this case, boys) in a fixed number of trials (in this case, births), with a constant probability of success (in this case, 0.5 or 50%) in each trial.

The probability of getting more than 60% boys in a given day follows the binomial distribution with parameters n (the number of births) and p (the probability of a boy, which is 0.5).

For hospital 1, with 45 births per day, the probability of getting more than 60% boys (i.e., 28 or more boys) is approximately 0.208 or 20.8%.

For hospital 2, with 15 births per day, the probability of getting more than 60% boys (i.e., 10 or more boys) is approximately 0.173 or 17.3%.

Since the probability of getting more than 60% boys is higher for hospital 1, we would expect hospital 1 to record more such days over the course of a year.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 1}
