To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day for each hospital.

Let's define the following events:
A: More than 60% boys born in hospital 1 on a given day
B: More than 60% boys born in hospital 2 on a given day

We can calculate the probability of each event using the binomial probability formula:

P(A) = ∑(k=24 to 45) (45 choose k) * (0.5)^k * (0.5)^(45-k)
P(B) = ∑(k=10 to 15) (15 choose k) * (0.5)^k * (0.5)^(15-k)

Here, we sum over the cases where the number of boys (k) is greater than or equal to 24 (60% of 45) for hospital 1, and greater than or equal to 10 (60% of 15) for hospital 2.

Evaluating these probabilities, we get:
P(A) ≈ 0.1282
P(B) ≈ 0.1715

Since P(B) > P(A), hospital 2 is more likely to have a day with more than 60% boys born.

If we assume that the events are independent for each day, and the probabilities remain constant over the year, we can expect hospital 2 to have more days with more than 60% boys born.

Therefore, my answer is:
{hospital: 2}
