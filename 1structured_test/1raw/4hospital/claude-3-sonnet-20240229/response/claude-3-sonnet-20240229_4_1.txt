To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes: success or failure.

In this case, we can consider the birth of a baby boy as a "success" and the birth of a baby girl as a "failure." The probability of a success (baby boy) is 0.5 (50%).

For hospital 1, with 45 births per day, the binomial distribution has n = 45 trials and p = 0.5 probability of success.
For hospital 2, with 15 births per day, the binomial distribution has n = 15 trials and p = 0.5 probability of success.

The probability of having more than 60% boys (27 or more out of 45 births for hospital 1, and 9 or more out of 15 births for hospital 2) can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula or a calculator.

Since hospital 1 has a larger number of births per day, it is more likely to deviate from the expected 50% ratio on any given day. Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys.
