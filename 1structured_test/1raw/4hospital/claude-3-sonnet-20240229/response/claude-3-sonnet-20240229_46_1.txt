To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of probability and the binomial distribution.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The probability of a baby being a boy is approximately 0.5 (50%).

The number of baby boys born in a hospital on a given day follows a binomial distribution, where the number of trials is the total number of babies born, and the probability of success (a baby being a boy) is 0.5.

For hospital 1, with 45 babies born each day, the probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45) on a given day is relatively small, approximately 0.1426 or 14.26%.

For hospital 2, with 15 babies born each day, the probability of having more than 9 boys (60% of 15) on a given day is relatively higher, approximately 0.2195 or 21.95%.

Since hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day, it is more likely to record more such days over a period of one year.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
