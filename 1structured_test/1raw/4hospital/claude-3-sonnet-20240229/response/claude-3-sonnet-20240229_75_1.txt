{hospital: 3}

Explanation:
The number of babies born per day in each hospital is not relevant to determine which hospital recorded more days with over 60% baby boys. What matters is the total number of births across the entire year.

In a year, hospital 1 has approximately 45 * 365 = 16,425 births, while hospital 2 has approximately 15 * 365 = 5,475 births.

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys on any given day follows a binomial distribution, which depends solely on the number of trials (births) and the probability of success (having a boy, which is around 0.5).

With a larger number of births, hospital 1 will have a more stable distribution closer to the mean of 50% baby boys. Hospital 2, with fewer births, will have a more variable distribution, sometimes recording a higher percentage of days with over 60% baby boys and sometimes a lower percentage.

Overall, the difference in the percentage of days with over 60% baby boys between the two hospitals is expected to be within 5% of each other, as the large sample sizes will cause the distributions to converge towards the mean of 50% baby boys.

Therefore, the answer is that they are about the same (within 5% of each other).
