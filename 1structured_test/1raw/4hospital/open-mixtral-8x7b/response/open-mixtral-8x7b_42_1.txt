{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, while in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. To find out if one hospital has more days with more than 60% baby boys, let's calculate the minimum number of baby boys needed to exceed this threshold.

In Hospital 1, with approximately 45 babies born per day, 60% of them would be 27 baby boys. Since the number of baby boys can vary and sometimes be higher than 50%, there will be days when Hospital 1 records more than 27 baby boys.

In Hospital 2, with approximately 15 babies born per day, 60% of them would be 9 baby boys. It would be much less likely for Hospital 2 to have more than 9 baby boys in a day.

Now let's compare the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in each hospital:

Hospital 1: With approximately 45 babies born per day, the distribution of baby boys is less variable compared to Hospital 2. This means that Hospital 1 is more likely to have days with more than 60% baby boys.

Hospital 2: With only 15 babies born per day, the distribution of baby boys is more sensitive to fluctuations. However, it is still unlikely to have more than 9 baby boys on a given day, making it less likely for Hospital 2 to record days with more than 60% baby boys.

Based on this analysis, I believe Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys.
