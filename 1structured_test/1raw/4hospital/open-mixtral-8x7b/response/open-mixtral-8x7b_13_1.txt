{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

To determine this, we need to calculate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys on any given day in each hospital. We know that about 50% of all babies are boys, so we can use the binomial distribution to find the probability of having at least 60% boys in a certain number of births.

Hospital 1 has about 45 births per day, so we want to find the probability of having at least 27 boy babies (60% of 45) in a day. Using the binomial distribution, this probability is approximately 0.016 (or 1.6%).

Hospital 2 has about 15 births per day, so we want to find the probability of having at least 9 boy babies (60% of 15) in a day. This probability is approximately 0.067 (or 6.7%).

Comparing these probabilities, we can see that Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys on any given day. However, this does not necessarily mean that Hospital 2 will record more such days over the course of a year.

To estimate the number of days with more than 60% baby boys in a year, we can use a Poisson approximation for the binomial distribution. The expected number of days with at least 27 boy babies in Hospital 1 is approximately 5.7 days per year, while the expected number of days with at least 9 boy babies in Hospital 2 is approximately 24.8 days per year.

Therefore, while Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys on any given day, Hospital 1 is expected to have fewer than 5% of the number of such days that Hospital 2 has over the course of a year. Thus, I believe that Hospital 1 recorded significantly fewer days with more than 60% baby boys.
