{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that in Hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, and in Hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need a larger sample size in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2.

To analyze this, let's determine the minimum number of babies needed for a day to have a 60% or higher boy-to-total ratio:
- For 60% boys, we need at least 0.6 * total babies.
- To have at least 60% boys out of 1 baby is impossible, as we would need a fraction of a baby.
- To have at least 60% boys out of 2 babies, the ratio should be 60%: 40% (1 boy and 1 girl).
- To have at least 60% boys out of 3 babies, the ratio should be 2 boys and 1 girl (2:1 or 66.67%).
- To have at least 60% boys out of 4 babies, the ratio should be 3 boys and 1 girl (3:1 or 75%).

From this, we can see that in order to have more than 60% boys, we need at least 4 babies in the sample. In Hospital 1, with 45 babies born each day, it is much more likely to have a day with more than 60% boys simply because of the larger sample size. In Hospital 2, with 15 babies born each day, it would be less likely to have a day with more than 60% boys due to the smaller sample size.

While the exact percentages will vary day-to-day, Hospital 1 will likely have more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys due to its larger sample size.
