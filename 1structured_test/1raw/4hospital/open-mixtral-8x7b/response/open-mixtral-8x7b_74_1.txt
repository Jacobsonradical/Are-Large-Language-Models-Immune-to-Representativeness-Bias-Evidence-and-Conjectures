{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, and in Hospital 2 it's around 15 per day. In order to have more than 60% of the babies being boys, we need a larger number of babies. So, let's calculate the minimum number of babies needed for both hospitals to have at least 60% boys on a given day:

Hospital 1:
To have 60% boys, we need at least (0.6 * 45) = 27 boys.
This leaves us with (45 - 27) = 18 girls.
So, we need at least 27 boys and 18 girls, totaling 45 babies.

Hospital 2:
To have 60% boys, we need at least (0.6 * 15) = 9 boys.
This leaves us with (15 - 9) = 6 girls.
So, we need at least 9 boys and 6 girls, totaling 15 babies.

Now, let's compare the probabilities of having more than 60% boys in each hospital. To do this, we'll use the binomial probability formula:

P(X ≥ k) = Σ (C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k))

where n is the number of trials (births), k is the number of successes (boy babies), and p is the probability of success (probability of a baby being a boy, which is 0.5).

For Hospital 1:
P(X ≥ 27) = P(27 boys or more)
Using the binomial probability formula, we find that the probability of having 27 or more boys in 45 births is approximately 0.077.

For Hospital 2:
P(X ≥ 9) = P(9 boys or more)
Using the binomial probability formula, we find that the probability of having 9 or more boys in 15 births is approximately 0.107.

Since Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day, it's more likely to record such days. However, we are looking for a difference of at least 5% between the number of days recorded by both hospitals.

Let's calculate the expected number of days with more than 60% boys for each hospital over a period of 1 year (365 days):

Hospital 1:
Expected number of days = 365 * 0.077 ≈ 28 days

Hospital 2:
Expected number of days = 365 * 0.107 ≈ 39 days

The difference between the expected number of days is approximately 11 days, which is less than 5% of the total number of days in a year (365 days). Therefore, I believe that Hospital 2 will record more days with more than 60% boys, but the difference is not substantial enough to be conclusive. So, I choose option 3, "about the same (within 5% of each other)." However, since I can only pick one answer, I will go with option 1, as Hospital 2 is still more likely to have more days with more than 60% boys.
