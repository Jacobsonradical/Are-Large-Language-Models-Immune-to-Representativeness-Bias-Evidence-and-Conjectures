{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, while in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. To find out if there is a difference between the number of days with more than 60% baby boys, we can use the binomial distribution to estimate the probability of having more than 27 babies being boys in Hospital 1 (60% of 45) and more than 9 babies being boys in Hospital 2 (60% of 15) on any given day.

Let's calculate the probability for Hospital 1:
p = 0.5 (even though it varies, assuming 50% for simplicity)
n = 45 (number of babies)
k > 27 (number of baby boys)

P(k > 27) = 1 - P(k ≤ 27)

Using a binomial calculator or software, we find that P(k > 27) ≈ 0.147 or 14.7%.

Now let's calculate the probability for Hospital 2:
p = 0.5 (even though it varies, assuming 50% for simplicity)
n = 15 (number of babies)
k > 9 (number of baby boys)

P(k > 9) ≈ 0.265 or 26.5%

Based on these calculations, Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day. However, since the number of babies and the percentage of baby boys vary daily, we cannot definitively say which hospital will have more such days in a year. 

To get an idea of which hospital might have more days with more than 60% baby boys, we can multiply the daily probabilities by the number of days in a year (365):

Hospital 1: 14.7% * 365 ≈ 53.55 or around 54 days
Hospital 2: 26.5% * 365 ≈ 96.95 or around 97 days

The difference between the estimated number of days is about 42 days, which is around 11.5% of the total year. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect that Hospital 2 will have more days with more than 60% baby boys, but the difference might not be substantial (within 5% of each other). Nonetheless, considering the daily variations and the assumptions made, I lean towards Hospital 1 recording fewer such days compared to Hospital 2.
