{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

To determine which hospital records more days with more than 60% baby boys, we need to compare the probabilities of such events at both hospitals. 

Let's assume a day with 10 babies born in each hospital for simplicity. The probability of having 6 or more baby boys in a sample of 10 is approximately 26% (using the binomial probability formula). 

However, this probability is not constant and varies based on the number of babies born that day. With a larger number of babies born, the probability of having 60% or more baby boys increases.

Given that Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day and Hospital 2 has about 15, the probability of having 60% or more baby boys is higher in Hospital 1 on any given day due to the larger sample size. 

Therefore, I believe that Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
