{hospital: 1}

Here's an estimation to explain my answer:

In Hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day. So, on a given day, there are on average 22.5 boys (0.5 * 45) born. To have more than 60% boys, there would need to be at least 27 boys born. The probability of having 27 or more boys out of 45 births is approximately 18.7% (calculated using binomial probability formula).

In Hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day. So, on a given day, there are on average 7.5 boys (0.5 * 15) born. To have more than 60% boys, there would need to be at least 9 boys born. The probability of having 9 or more boys out of 15 births is approximately 8.3% (calculated using binomial probability formula).

Since Hospital 1 has higher daily births and thus more variability, it is more likely to have days with more than 60% boys. Over the course of a year, Hospital 1 would record more such days compared to Hospital 2.
