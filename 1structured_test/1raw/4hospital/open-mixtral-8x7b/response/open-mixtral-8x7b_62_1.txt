{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has about 45 baby births per day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 baby births per day. To find out if there is a difference in the number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, we can calculate the minimum number of baby boys needed for each hospital to have more than 60% boys born on a given day.

For Hospital 1:
- With 45 babies born per day, having 60% boys would mean 27 boys (0.6 * 45).

For Hospital 2:
- With 15 babies born per day, having 60% boys would mean 9 boys (0.6 * 15).

Now, let's calculate the probability of having at least 27 boys out of 45 births or 9 boys out of 15 births, assuming a 50% chance of a baby being a boy:

For Hospital 1:
- The probability of having at least 27 boys out of 45 births is calculated as the sum of the probabilities of having 27, 28, 29, ..., 45 boys. The exact calculation would be quite complex, but using a binomial probability calculator or software, we can find the result to be approximately 0.2264 or 22.64%.

For Hospital 2:
- The probability of having at least 9 boys out of 15 births is calculated as the sum of the probabilities of having 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 boys. Again, using a binomial probability calculator or software, we can find the result to be approximately 0.3661 or 36.61%.

Comparing the two probabilities, Hospital 2 has a higher chance of having more than 60% boys born on a given day. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 2 recorded more such days. However, the difference between the two probabilities is about 13.97%, which is larger than the 5% threshold given in the problem. So, to be more precise, Hospital 2 is likely to record more than Hospital 1, but it doesn't fall within the 5% range requested.

Nonetheless, considering the given threshold, I would still choose Hospital 2 as the most likely to have more days with more than 60% boys born. But, technically, neither Hospital 1 nor Hospital 2 are about the same within 5% of each other.
