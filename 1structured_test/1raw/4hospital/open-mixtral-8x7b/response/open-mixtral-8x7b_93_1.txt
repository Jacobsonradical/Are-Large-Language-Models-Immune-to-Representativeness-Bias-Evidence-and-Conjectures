{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, and in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need a larger sample size in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2. This is because, even with small deviations from the 50% average, the number of baby boys can easily surpass 60% in Hospital 1, while it would be harder for Hospital 2 to achieve such a high percentage due to its smaller sample size.

To illustrate this, let's calculate the minimum number of baby boys needed for each hospital to have more than 60% boys:
- For Hospital 1: 0.6 * 45 = 27 baby boys
- For Hospital 2: 0.6 * 15 = 9 baby boys

We can see that Hospital 1 requires only 27 baby boys to reach the 60% threshold, while Hospital 2 needs 9. The probability of having 27 or more baby boys in Hospital 1 is much higher than having 9 or more baby boys in Hospital 2, given that the probability of a baby being a boy is around 50%. 

Therefore, I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys.
