{hospital: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

We're given that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born per day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born per day. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need to consider the following scenario:

For Hospital 1:
- To have 60% of 45 babies as boys, we would need at least 27 boys (0.6 * 45).
- The probability of having at least 27 boys in a day is calculated using the binomial probability formula.
- The variance of the number of boys born in a day is higher in Hospital 1 due to the larger number of daily births.
- Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have more than 60% boys born on a given day compared to Hospital 2.

For Hospital 2:
- To have 60% of 15 babies as boys, we would need at least 9 boys (0.6 * 15).
- The probability of having at least 9 boys in a day is also calculated using the binomial probability formula.
- However, the variance of the number of boys born in a day is lower in Hospital 2 due to the smaller number of daily births.

By comparing the probabilities and variances for both hospitals, we can conclude that Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys born, compared to Hospital 2.
