{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

To estimate the number of days with more than 60% baby boys in each hospital, we can use a binomial distribution model. For simplicity, let's assume that the actual percentage of baby boys is exactly 50%.

In Hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day. So, on any given day, the expected number of baby boys is 22.5 (45 * 0.5). Using the binomial distribution, we can calculate the probability of having 28 or more baby boys (which is equal to or greater than 60% of 45) in a day:

P(X ≥ 28) = 1 - P(X < 28)
         ≈ 0.0422

In Hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day. So, on any given day, the expected number of baby boys is 7.5 (15 * 0.5). Using the binomial distribution, we can calculate the probability of having 10 or more baby boys (which is equal to or greater than 60% of 15) in a day:

P(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X < 10)
         ≈ 0.1178

Now, let's calculate the number of days with more than 60% baby boys in each hospital over a period of 1 year (365 days). We can use the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution to simplify the calculation:

For Hospital 1:
λ = n * p = 365 * 0.0422 ≈ 15.33
P(X ≥ 15) ≈ 1 - P(X < 15) ≈ 0.0321

For Hospital 2:
λ = n * p = 365 * 0.1178 ≈ 42.97
P(X ≥ 10) ≈ 1 - P(X < 10) ≈ 0.0964

Based on these calculations, Hospital 1 is expected to have about 3.21% of days with more than 60% baby boys, while Hospital 2 is expected to have about 9.64% of days with more than 60% baby boys. Therefore, Hospital 2 has a higher percentage of days with more than 60% baby boys, but the difference is substantial (about 6.43%). Hence, I think Hospital 1 recorded fewer such days. However, the difference is not within 5%, so the answer is 1 (Hospital 1 recorded more such days) rather than 3 (they are about the same within 5% of each other).
