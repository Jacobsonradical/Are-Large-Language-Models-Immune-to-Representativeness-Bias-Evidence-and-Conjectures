{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is about three times that of Hospital 2 (45 vs 15). Since the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, let's consider two scenarios: one with a higher percentage of boys and another with a lower percentage.

Scenario 1 - Higher percentage of boys:
In this case, let's assume that 65% of the babies born are boys. We want to find out how often each hospital will have more than 60% boys born in a day.

For Hospital 1, we need at least 29 boys out of 45 babies (60% * 45 = 27, rounded up). According to the binomial probability formula, the chance of having 29 or more boys in Hospital 1 is about 10.6%.

For Hospital 2, we need at least 10 boys out of 15 babies (60% * 15 = 9, rounded up). The chance of having 10 or more boys in Hospital 2 is about 29.6%.

Scenario 2 - Lower percentage of boys:
In this case, let's assume that only 45% of the babies born are boys. We still want to find out how often each hospital will have more than 60% boys born in a day.

For Hospital 1, the chance of having more than 27 boys (60% * 45 = 27, rounded down) is about 4.1%, while for Hospital 2, the chance of having more than 9 boys (60% * 15 = 9, rounded down) is about 1.5%.

Based on these scenarios, Hospital 1 is more likely to have more days with more than 60% boys born since its daily baby count is higher. However, the exact difference in the number of such days between the two hospitals will depend on the actual daily variation in the percentage of baby boys. Nonetheless, it's reasonable to assume that Hospital 1 will have significantly more days with more than 60% boys born than Hospital 2. Therefore, my answer is 1.
