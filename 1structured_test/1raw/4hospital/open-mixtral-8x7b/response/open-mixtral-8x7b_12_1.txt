{hospital: 1}

Here's my reasoning:

To determine which hospital records more days with more than 60% baby boys, we need to compare the probability of having at least 60% boys on any given day at each hospital. 

In hospital 1, with approximately 45 babies born each day, we would expect about 27 boys on a day when the ratio is exactly 50%. To have more than 60% boys, we would need at least 27 + 9 = 36 boys in a day. The probability of this happening can be estimated using the binomial distribution. The exact calculation is a bit complex, but using appropriate statistical software, we can calculate the probability of having 36 or more boys in a day.

We do the same for hospital 2, with approximately 15 babies born each day. We would expect about 8 boys on a day when the ratio is exactly 50%. To have more than 60% boys, we would need at least 10 boys in a day. Again, we calculate the probability of this happening using the binomial distribution.

When we compare these probabilities, we find that hospital 1 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a day. Therefore, over the course of a year, we would expect hospital 1 to record more such days.
