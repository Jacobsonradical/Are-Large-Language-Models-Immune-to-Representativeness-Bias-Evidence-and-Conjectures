{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is about three times that of Hospital 2 (45 vs 15). This difference in sample size makes it more likely for Hospital 1 to have days with a higher percentage of baby boys, even if the percentage of baby boys is actually lower than 50% on average.

To estimate the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day, we can use a binomial distribution. For Hospital 1, the probability of having at least 30 boys out of 45 births is about 0.0025, or 0.25% (assuming a 50% chance of a boy). For Hospital 2, the probability of having at least 9 boys out of 15 births is about 0.027, or 2.7% (again, assuming a 50% chance of a boy).

However, due to the larger sample size in Hospital 1, the number of days where more than 60% of the babies are boys will be higher for Hospital 1. To compare them directly, we can calculate the expected number of such days for each hospital. For Hospital 1, this is approximately 0.25% \* 365 = 0.91 days. For Hospital 2, this is approximately 2.7% \* 365 = 9.86 days.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded fewer such days, but still within the same order of magnitude as Hospital 2. Given the large difference in sample sizes, I would estimate that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys, but the difference is unlikely to be substantial. So, my answer is Hospital 1 (option 1), but the difference is likely within 5% of each other (option 3 might also be a valid answer, depending on the specific definition of "about the same").
