{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, and in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. To find out if there is a difference between the number of days with more than 60% baby boys, we can perform a simulation or use statistical methods.

Let's assume a 50% chance of a baby being a boy. The probability of having more than 60% boys in a day is calculated as follows:

P(>= 27 boys in Hospital 1) = ∑(P(X=i) where i ranges from 27 to 45)
P(>= 9 boys in Hospital 2) = ∑(P(X=i) where i ranges from 9 to 15)

Calculating these probabilities, we get:
P(>= 27 boys in Hospital 1) ≈ 0.0042
P(>= 9 boys in Hospital 2) ≈ 0.0244

Now, let's calculate the ratio of these probabilities:
Ratio = P(>= 27 boys in Hospital 1) / P(>= 9 boys in Hospital 2) ≈ 0.1724

This means that Hospital 1 is expected to have about 17% as many days with more than 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 2. Since 17% is not close to 5%, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more such days.
