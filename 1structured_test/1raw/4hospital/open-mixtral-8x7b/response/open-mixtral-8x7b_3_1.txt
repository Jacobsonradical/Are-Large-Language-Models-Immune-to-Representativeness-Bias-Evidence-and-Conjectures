{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 births per day, and Hospital 2 has about 15. To find out if there's a difference in the number of days with more than 60% baby boys, we can calculate the probability of having such a day in each hospital.

In a hospital with 45 births per day, we need at least 27 boys to have more than 60% baby boys (27 out of 45 is approximately 60%). The probability of this happening can be calculated using the binomial distribution. The mean number of boys in Hospital 1 is 22.5 (45 * 0.5), and the standard deviation is about 4.71 (sqrt(45*0.5*0.5)). With these values, we can calculate the probability of having 27 or more boys in a day, which is around 0.092 or 9.2%.

In a hospital with 15 births per day, we need at least 9 boys to have more than 60% baby boys (9 out of 15 is exactly 60%). The probability of this happening can also be calculated using the binomial distribution. The mean number of boys in Hospital 2 is 7.5 (15 * 0.5), and the standard deviation is about 1.58 (sqrt(15*0.5*0.5)). With these values, we can calculate the probability of having 9 or more boys in a day, which is around 0.117 or 11.7%.

Since Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having a day with more than 60% baby boys, we might expect it to have more such days in a year. However, the difference in probabilities is not large (only about 2.5%). Considering the randomness involved and the fact that this difference is relatively small, I think it's reasonable to assume that the number of days with more than 60% baby boys in each hospital would be close to each other.

However, if we must choose an answer, based on the given probabilities, Hospital 2 has a slightly higher chance of having more days with more than 60% baby boys. Therefore, I would lean towards answer 2. But, considering the small difference, I would say that the answer is closer to option 3: they are about the same (within 5% of each other).
