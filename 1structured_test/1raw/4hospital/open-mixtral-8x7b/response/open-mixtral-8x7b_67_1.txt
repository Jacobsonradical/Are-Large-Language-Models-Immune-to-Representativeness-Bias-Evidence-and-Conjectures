{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

1. The number of babies born in each hospital is relatively consistent, with 45 born in hospital 1 and 15 born in hospital 2 each day.
2. To have more than 60% baby boys on a given day, there needs to be a higher than average number of boy births.
3. Due to the larger number of births in hospital 1, there is a higher probability that they will have a day with a greater percentage of boy births.
4. Even though the percentage of baby boys is around 50% on average, the law of large numbers suggests that hospital 1 will have more days with a higher percentage of baby boys simply due to the larger sample size.
5. Although it is possible for hospital 2 to have more days with a higher percentage of baby boys, it is less likely due to the smaller number of births.

Therefore, I think hospital 1 recorded more such days.
