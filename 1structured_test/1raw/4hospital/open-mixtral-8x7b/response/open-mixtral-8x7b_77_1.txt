{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is about three times that of Hospital 2 (45 vs 15). This larger sample size in Hospital 1 increases the chances of observing days with a higher percentage of baby boys, even if the actual percentage of baby boys is close to 50%.

To estimate the probability of having a day with more than 60% baby boys, let's assume a 50% probability of a baby being a boy. We can use the binomial distribution to calculate this probability.

In Hospital 1, for a day with 45 births, the probability of having 27 or more baby boys (more than 60%) is approximately 0.047 or 4.7%. In Hospital 2, for a day with 15 births, the probability of having 9 or more baby boys (more than 60%) is approximately 0.023 or 2.3%.

However, due to the larger sample size in Hospital 1, it will record more days with a higher percentage of baby boys. Over a period of 1 year, Hospital 1 is expected to have about 18 such days (4.7% of 365 days), while Hospital 2 is expected to have about 8 days (2.3% of 365 days). Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys.
