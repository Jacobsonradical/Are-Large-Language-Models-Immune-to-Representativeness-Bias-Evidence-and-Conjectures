{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has about 15. To find out which hospital is more likely to have more than 60% boys in a day, we can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of having at least 27 boys (60% of 45) in Hospital 1 and at least 9 boys (60% of 15) in Hospital 2.

For Hospital 1:
P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - P(X < 27)
         ≈ 0.0724 (using the binom.dist function in Excel)

For Hospital 2:
P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - P(X < 9)
         ≈ 0.1642 (using the binom.dist function in Excel)

Based on these calculations, Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% boys in a day. However, the question asks for the number of days in a year when this occurs, not the daily probability.

To estimate the number of such days in a year, we can multiply the daily probability by 365. For Hospital 1, this gives us an estimate of 26 days per year, while for Hospital 2, it's about 60 days per year. The difference is not huge, but it suggests that Hospital 2 is more likely to have more than 60% boys in a day than Hospital 1. Therefore, I believe Hospital 2 recorded more such days. However, the difference is within 5%, so answering "3" would also be reasonable.
