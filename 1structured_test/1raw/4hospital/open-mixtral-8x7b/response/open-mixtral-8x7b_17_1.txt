{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has around 15. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need to determine the minimum number of baby boys required for each hospital.

For Hospital 1:
- With 45 babies born each day, having 60% of them as boys would mean 0.6 * 45 = 27 baby boys.
- To find the probability of having at least one day with 27 or more baby boys in a year, we can use the binomial probability formula:
  P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - P(X < 27)
         ≈ 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 26))
- Calculating this probability for Hospital 1, we get P(X ≥ 27) ≈ 0.00014 or approximately 0.014%.

For Hospital 2:
- With 15 babies born each day, having 60% of them as boys would mean 0.6 * 15 = 9 baby boys.
- Using the same approach as above, we calculate P(X ≥ 9) ≈ 0.3815 or approximately 38.15%.

Comparing the probabilities, Hospital 1 has a much lower chance (0.014%) of having more than 60% baby boys on any given day than Hospital 2 (38.15%). Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded fewer such days, and Hospital 2 recorded more.

However, even though Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day, it does not necessarily mean that Hospital 2 will have significantly more days than Hospital 1 with this occurrence over a year. To confirm this, we would need to simulate or calculate the exact number of days with the given condition for both hospitals throughout a year. Nonetheless, based on the provided information and the calculated probabilities, it is still reasonable to conclude that Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys than Hospital 1.
