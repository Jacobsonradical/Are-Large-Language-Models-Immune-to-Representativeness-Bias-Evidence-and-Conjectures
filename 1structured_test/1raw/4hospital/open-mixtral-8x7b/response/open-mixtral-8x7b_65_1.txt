{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has around 15. To find out which hospital is more likely to have more than 60% boys on a given day, we can use the binomial probability formula.

For Hospital 1, let's calculate the probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45) in a day:

P(X > 27) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27)

where X is the number of boy babies and P(X ≤ 27) can be calculated using the binomial distribution with n = 45 (number of births) and p = 0.5 (probability of a baby being a boy).

For Hospital 2, let's calculate the probability of having more than 9 boys (60% of 15) in a day:

P(X > 9) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9)

where X is the number of boy babies and P(X ≤ 9) can be calculated using the binomial distribution with n = 15 (number of births) and p = 0.5 (probability of a baby being a boy).

Calculating these probabilities with a statistical calculator or software, we find that:

P(X > 27) ≈ 0.053
P(X > 9) ≈ 0.294

So, Hospital 1 has a lower probability (5.3%) of having more than 60% boys in a day compared to Hospital 2 (29.4%). This suggests that over a period of 1 year, Hospital 1 is more likely to record fewer such days than Hospital 2. Therefore, I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with less than 60% boys, while Hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% boys.
