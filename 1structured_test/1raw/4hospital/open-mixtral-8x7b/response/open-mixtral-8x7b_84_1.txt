{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has about 15. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need to determine the minimum number of baby boys required for each hospital.

For Hospital 1:
- With 45 babies born each day, having 60% boys would mean 27 boys (0.6 * 45).
- To find the probability of having at least one day with 27 or more baby boys in a year, we can use the binomial probability formula:
  - P(X >= 27) = 1 - P(X < 27)
  - Where X is the number of days with 27 or more baby boys, and P(X < 27) is the sum of probabilities for all days with less than 27 baby boys.
  - Using the binomial probability formula, we get P(X >= 27) ≈ 0.1224 or 12.24%

For Hospital 2:
- With 15 babies born each day, having 60% boys would mean 9 boys (0.6 * 15).
- To find the probability of having at least one day with 9 or more baby boys in a year, we can use the binomial probability formula:
  - P(X >= 9) = 1 - P(X < 9)
  - Where X is the number of days with 9 or more baby boys, and P(X < 9) is the sum of probabilities for all days with less than 9 baby boys.
  - Using the binomial probability formula, we get P(X >= 9) ≈ 0.3454 or 34.54%

Comparing the two probabilities, Hospital 1 has a lower probability (12.24%) of having more than 60% boys born on a given day compared to Hospital 2 (34.54%). Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded fewer such days, and Hospital 2 recorded more. However, the question asks for an answer within 5% of each other, so technically neither hospital meets this criterion. But if we have to choose, Hospital 1 is the most different from Hospital 2 in terms of percentage.
