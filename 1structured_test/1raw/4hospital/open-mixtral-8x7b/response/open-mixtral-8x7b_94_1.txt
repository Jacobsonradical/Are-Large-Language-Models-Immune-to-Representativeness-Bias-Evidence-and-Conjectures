{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We're given that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born per day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born per day. To find out which hospital is more likely to have more than 60% baby boys on a given day, we can calculate the probability of having 27 or more baby boys (which corresponds to 60% of 45 or 60% of 15) in each hospital.

For Hospital 1, the daily average of baby boys is a binomial distribution with 45 trials (births) and a 0.5 probability of success (boy). We can calculate the probability of having 27 or more baby boys using the binom.dist function in Excel:

=BINOM.DIST(27, 45, 0.5, TRUE)

This gives us approximately 0.133, or 13.3%.

For Hospital 2, the daily average of baby boys is a binomial distribution with 15 trials (births) and a 0.5 probability of success (boy). We can calculate the probability of having 9 or more baby boys (which corresponds to 60% of 15) using the binom.dist function in Excel:

=BINOM.DIST(9, 15, 0.5, TRUE)

This gives us approximately 0.028, or 2.8%.

Since the probability of Hospital 1 having 60% or more baby boys is significantly higher than that of Hospital 2, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
