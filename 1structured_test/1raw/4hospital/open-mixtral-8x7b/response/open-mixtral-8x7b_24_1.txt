{hospital: 1}

Here's my reasoning:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, while in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. To find out if there's a difference between the hospitals in terms of the number of days with more than 60% baby boys, we can analyze the distribution of boys and girls on any given day.

In Hospital 1, with approximately 45 births per day, we would expect about 22.5 (0.5 * 45) baby boys on average each day. However, the number of baby boys can vary from day to day. To have more than 60% baby boys, we would need at least 27 baby boys. Using the binomial probability distribution, we can calculate the probability of having 27 or more baby boys out of 45 births:

P(X >= 27) = 0.1129 (approximately)

In Hospital 2, with approximately 15 births per day, we would expect about 7.5 (0.5 * 15) baby boys on average each day. However, the number of baby boys can vary from day to day. To have more than 60% baby boys, we would need at least 9 baby boys. Using the binomial probability distribution, we can calculate the probability of having 9 or more baby boys out of 15 births:

P(X >= 9) = 0.2651 (approximately)

Based on these calculations, Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys on any given day. However, since we are comparing the number of such days over a period of 1 year for both hospitals, we need to account for the difference in daily births.

Let's assume there are 365 days in a year. The expected number of days with more than 60% baby boys in Hospital 1 would be:

365 * 0.1129 = 40.9155 (approximately)

The expected number of days with more than 60% baby boys in Hospital 2 would be:

365 * 0.2651 = 96.9165 (approximately)

So, Hospital 2 is expected to have more days with more than 60% baby boys. However, the difference is not within 5%. To be within 5%, the difference between the expected numbers of days should be less than or equal to 0.05 * (40.9155 + 96.9165) = 7.3458. Since the difference is 96.9165 - 40.9155 = 55.991, which is greater than 7.3458, we can conclude that Hospital 2 has significantly more days with more than 60% baby boys than Hospital 1.

Therefore, I think Hospital 1 recorded fewer such days, Hospital 2 recorded more such days, and they are not about the same (within 5% of each other).
