{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that in Hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, and in Hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day. To find out which hospital has more days with more than 60% baby boys, we can calculate the minimum number of baby boys needed to have 60% of the daily births being boys.

For Hospital 1:
- With 45 babies born per day, 60% of them would be 0.6 * 45 = 27 baby boys.
- We would need consecutive days with at least 27 baby boys born to record such a day.

For Hospital 2:
- With 15 babies born per day, 60% of them would be 0.6 * 15 = 9 baby boys.
- We would need consecutive days with at least 9 baby boys born to record such a day.

Since Hospital 1 has a higher number of daily births, it will have more variation in the number of baby boys born each day compared to Hospital 2. This increases the likelihood of having consecutive days with more than 60% baby boys. Therefore, I think Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
