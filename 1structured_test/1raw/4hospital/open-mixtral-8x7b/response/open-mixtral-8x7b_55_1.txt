{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has about 15. To find out which hospital is more likely to have more than 60% boys in a day, we can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of having at least 27 boys (60% of 45) in Hospital 1 and at least 9 boys (60% of 15) in Hospital 2.

For Hospital 1:
P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - P(X < 27)
         = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 26)]
         = 0.0089 (approximately)

For Hospital 2:
P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - P(X < 9)
        = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 8)]
        = 0.0439 (approximately)

Based on these calculations, Hospital 1 has a lower probability of having more than 60% boys in a day compared to Hospital 2. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% boys. However, to determine if they are about the same (within 5% of each other), we would need to calculate the probability of the difference between the two hospitals' daily records falling within a 5% margin. This calculation is beyond the scope of the information provided and may not be necessary for the purpose of this question.
