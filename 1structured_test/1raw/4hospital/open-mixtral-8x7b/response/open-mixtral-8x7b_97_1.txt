{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is about three times that of Hospital 2 (45 vs 15). This means that Hospital 1 has more data points and thus a higher chance of having extreme values (like having more than 60% baby boys).

To estimate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a single day, we can use the binomial distribution. Let's assume that the percentage of baby boys is exactly 50% on average. Then, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a single day is:

P(X > 0.6 * n) = 1 - P(X <= 0.6 * n)

where X is the number of baby boys and n is the total number of babies born in a day.

For Hospital 1, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a single day is:

P(X > 0.6 * 45) = 1 - P(X <= 27) = 0.0383

For Hospital 2, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a single day is:

P(X > 0.6 * 15) = 1 - P(X <= 9) = 0.0938

Therefore, Hospital 1 has a lower probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a single day compared to Hospital 2. However, because Hospital 1 has more data points, it is more likely to have more days that exceed this threshold. Specifically, we can estimate the expected number of days with more than 60% baby boys as:

Expected days = number of days in a year * probability of having more than 60% baby boys

For Hospital 1:

Expected days = 365 * 0.0383 = 13.845

For Hospital 2:

Expected days = 365 * 0.0938 = 34.277

Therefore, Hospital 1 is expected to have about 14 days with more than 60% baby boys, while Hospital 2 is expected to have about 34 days. This means that Hospital 1 is expected to have about 20 fewer days with more than 60% baby boys than Hospital 2, which is not within 5% of each other. Therefore, I think Hospital 1 recorded fewer such days.
