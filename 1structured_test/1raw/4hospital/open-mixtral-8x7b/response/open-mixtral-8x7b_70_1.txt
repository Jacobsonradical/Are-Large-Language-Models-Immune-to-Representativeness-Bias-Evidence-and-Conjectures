{hospital: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that the number of baby boys is a random variable with an average of 50% of the total number of babies born each day. The variability in the percentage of baby boys depends on the number of babies born.

Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). Due to this difference, the percentage of baby boys in Hospital 1 will have less variability compared to Hospital 2. This is because the proportion is calculated as the number of baby boys divided by the total number of babies. A larger denominator reduces the relative impact of variation in the numerator.

With less variability in Hospital 1's daily percentage of baby boys, it is more likely that the threshold of 60% will be crossed occasionally, simply due to random chance. In Hospital 2, with its lower daily birth rate and higher variability, it is less likely that the threshold of 60% will be crossed.

Therefore, we can expect Hospital 1 to have more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
