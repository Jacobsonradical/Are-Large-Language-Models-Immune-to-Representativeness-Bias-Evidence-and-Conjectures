{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is about three times that of Hospital 2 (45 vs 15). Since the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, let's consider the extreme cases where either all or none of the babies born are boys.

In Hospital 1, even if all 15 boys were born on a particular day in Hospital 2, Hospital 1 would still have 30 girls born, making the percentage of baby boys 37.5% (45 total births * 0.6 = 27 boys needed, but only 15 boys were born). Hospital 1 would need an extremely unlikely scenario for more than 60% of the babies to be boys.

Now consider Hospital 2. For more than 60% of the babies to be boys, at least 10 boys need to be born (15 total births * 0.6 = 9 boys needed). This leaves only 5 girls born, making the percentage of baby boys 66.7%.

Comparing the two scenarios, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more than 60% of the babies born as boys than Hospital 1 due to its smaller size. Therefore, I think Hospital 1 recorded fewer such days. However, without actual data on the daily percentage of baby boys, I cannot accurately determine if Hospital 2 recorded more or if they are about the same (within 5% of each other). Nonetheless, I believe the difference is significant enough to choose Hospital 1 as having fewer such days.
