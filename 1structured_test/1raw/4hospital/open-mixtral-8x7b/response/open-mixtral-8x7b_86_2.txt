{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

To determine which hospital records more days with more than 60% baby boys, we need to compare the probabilities at each hospital. 

At Hospital 1, with approximately 45 babies born per day, we would expect about 27 boys (45 * 0.5) to be born on any given day. For more than 60% to be boys, we would need at least 27 + 0.5 * 45 = 36.75 boys, which rounds up to 37 boys. The probability of this happening is quite low, as it would require a binomial distribution with p=0.5 and n=45 to have a value greater than or equal to 37. Using a binomial calculator, this probability is approximately 0.005 or 0.5%.

At Hospital 2, with approximately 15 babies born per day, we would expect about 7.5 boys to be born on any given day. For more than 60% to be boys, we would need at least 7.5 + 0.6 * 15 = 13.5 boys, which rounds up to 14 boys. The probability of this happening is slightly higher than Hospital 1, as it would require a binomial distribution with p=0.5 and n=15 to have a value greater than or equal to 14. Using a binomial calculator, this probability is approximately 1.5% or 0.015.

Comparing the two probabilities, Hospital 1 has a lower probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a day than Hospital 2. Over the course of a year, this difference accumulates, and Hospital 1 is expected to have fewer days with more than 60% baby boys. However, the difference between the two probabilities is small, and they are not about the same within 5% of each other. Therefore, I think Hospital 1 recorded more such days, but the difference is not substantial.
