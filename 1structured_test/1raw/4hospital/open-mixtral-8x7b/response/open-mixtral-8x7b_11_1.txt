{hospital: 1}

Here's my reasoning:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has about 15. To find out whether there is a difference in the number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, we need to calculate the minimum number of boys needed for this condition and compare it with the daily average of boys born in each hospital.

For Hospital 1:
- Daily average: 45 babies * 50% (for boys) = 22.5 ≈ 23 boys per day
- To have more than 60% boys, we need at least 27 boys (45 * 60% ≈ 27)
- Probability of having more than 60% boys: P(≥27 boys)

For Hospital 2:
- Daily average: 15 babies * 50% (for boys) = 7.5 ≈ 8 boys per day
- To have more than 60% boys, we need at least 9 boys (15 * 60% ≈ 9)
- Probability of having more than 60% boys: P(≥9 boys)

Now let's consider a Poisson distribution for the number of boys born in each hospital, which is appropriate for rare events like this. The probability mass function for a Poisson distribution is given by:

P(X=k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!

where λ is the expected value (daily average of boys born).

Calculating the probabilities for both hospitals, we find that:

P(≥27 boys in Hospital 1) ≈ 0.0058
P(≥9 boys in Hospital 2) ≈ 0.0260

Now, let's compare the probabilities:

Hospital 1: 0.0058
Hospital 2: 0.0260

Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% boys born in a day. However, we are looking for the number of days with this condition over a period of 1 year. To estimate this, we can multiply the daily probabilities by 365 days:

Expected number of days with >60% boys in Hospital 1: 0.0058 * 365 ≈ 2.11 days
Expected number of days with >60% boys in Hospital 2: 0.0260 * 365 ≈ 9.52 days

Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 2 recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
