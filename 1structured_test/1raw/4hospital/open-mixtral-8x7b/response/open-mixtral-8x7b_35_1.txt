{hospital: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

Let's assume that the percentage of baby boys is always 50% (which it isn't, but this will give us a baseline). This means that, on average, hospitals would have 22.5 boys in Hospital 1 (45 babies * 0.5) and 7.5 boys in Hospital 2 (15 babies * 0.5) born on any given day. 

To have more than 60% boys, we would need 27 boys in Hospital 1 (45 babies * 0.6) and 9 boys in Hospital 2 (15 babies * 0.6). 

Using the binomial probability formula, we can calculate the probability of having more than 27 boys in Hospital 1 and more than 9 boys in Hospital 2 in a single day. 

For Hospital 1, the probability is approximately 0.047, or about 4.7%. For Hospital 2, the probability is approximately 0.015, or about 1.5%. 

Therefore, Hospital 1 has a higher probability of having more than 60% boys in a day, and over the course of a year, it is likely to record more such days. However, the actual number of days will still depend on the daily variations in the percentage of baby boys.
