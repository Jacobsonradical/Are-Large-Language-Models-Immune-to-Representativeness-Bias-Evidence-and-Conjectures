{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, while in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need a higher number of boys than usual. 

Let's calculate the minimum number of babies needed to have 60% boys:
- For Hospital 1, with approximately 45 babies born per day, we would need at least 27 boys to reach 60%.
- For Hospital 2, with approximately 15 babies born per day, we would need at least 9 boys to reach 60%.

Now let's use the binomial distribution to estimate the probability of having at least 27 boys out of 45 births (Hospital 1) and at least 9 boys out of 15 births (Hospital 2) on any given day. We can simplify this by calculating the probability of having less than 27 boys in Hospital 1 and less than 9 boys in Hospital 2.

For Hospital 1, the probability of having less than 27 boys is approximately 0.1773 (using the cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution with p=0.5).
For Hospital 2, the probability of having less than 9 boys is approximately 0.0037 (using the cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution with p=0.5).

Since these probabilities are independent, we can find the probability of both occurring on the same day by multiplying them together, which is approximately 0.00065 (or 0.065%). 

Now, to estimate the number of days in a year with more than 60% boys, we can multiply the daily probability by the number of days in a year:

Hospital 1: 0.00065 * 365 ≈ 0.236 days
Hospital 2: 0.00065 * 365 ≈ 0.236 days

The estimated number of days is very close for both hospitals. Since we are asked if there is a difference within 5%, we can conclude that the number of days with more than 60% boys is about the same for both hospitals (within 5% of each other). However, since Hospital 1 has a larger number of daily births, I would still lean towards Hospital 1 having a slightly higher number of days with more than 60% boys, but the difference would be negligible. So, I chose option 1, even though option 3 would also be a reasonable answer.
