{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is about three times that of Hospital 2 (45 vs. 15). This larger sample size in Hospital 1 will make it more likely for extreme events (like having more than 60% baby boys) to occur, compared to Hospital 2.

To estimate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a single day, we can use the binomial distribution. Assuming 50% probability of a baby being a boy, the probability of having 27 or more boys out of 45 births is approximately 0.115, or 11.5%. Similarly, the probability of having 10 or more boys out of 15 births is approximately 0.088, or 8.8%.

Since Hospital 1 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys, it is likely to record more such days. However, we cannot precisely say by what margin Hospital 1 will have more days with more than 60% baby boys, only that it is more likely.
