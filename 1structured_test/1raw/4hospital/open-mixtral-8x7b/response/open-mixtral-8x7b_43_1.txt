{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We are given that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born each day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day. In order to compare the number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, we need to calculate the expected number of baby boys on a given day for each hospital.

For Hospital 1:
On average, there are 45 births per day, so 60% of that is 27 baby boys. The number of days where Hospital 1 records more than 27 baby boys born will be compared to Hospital 2.

For Hospital 2:
On average, there are 15 births per day, so 60% of that is 9 baby boys. Similarly, the number of days where Hospital 2 records more than 9 baby boys born will be compared to Hospital 1.

Now, let's analyze the probabilities:

For Hospital 1, calculating the probability of having more than 27 baby boys in a day can be approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 22.5 (half of 45) and a standard deviation of approximately 4.6 (since the number of boys is binomially distributed). Using this approximation, we can calculate the probability of having more than 27 baby boys, which is approximately 0.028 or 2.8%.

For Hospital 2, calculating the probability of having more than 9 baby boys in a day can be approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 7.5 (half of 15) and a standard deviation of approximately 2.2. Using this approximation, we can calculate the probability of having more than 9 baby boys, which is approximately 0.014 or 1.4%.

Based on these probabilities, Hospital 1 has a higher chance of observing days with more than 60% baby boys than Hospital 2. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more such days.
