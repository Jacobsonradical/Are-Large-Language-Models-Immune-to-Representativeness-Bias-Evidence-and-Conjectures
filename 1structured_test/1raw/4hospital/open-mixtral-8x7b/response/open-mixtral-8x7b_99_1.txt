{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that in Hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, and in Hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day. To find out which hospital is more likely to have more than 60% baby boys in a day, we can calculate the probability of having at least 27 boys (60% of 45) in Hospital 1 and 9 boys (60% of 15) in Hospital 2.

In a hospital, the number of boy babies follows a binomial distribution, where the probability of a boy baby is 0.5. We can approximate this distribution with a normal distribution, which is valid when the number of trials (babies born) is large.

For Hospital 1, the mean (μ) is 22.5 boy babies (45 * 0.5), and the standard deviation (σ) is about 3.27 (sqrt(45 * 0.5 * 0.5)). For Hospital 2, the mean (μ) is 7.5 boy babies (15 * 0.5), and the standard deviation (σ) is about 1.58 (sqrt(15 * 0.5 * 0.5)).

Now, let's calculate the z-score for 27 boys in Hospital 1: z = (27 - 22.5) / 3.27 ≈ 1.44
And for 9 boys in Hospital 2: z = (9 - 7.5) / 1.58 ≈ 0.95

The probability of having at least 27 boys in Hospital 1 is approximately the area under the normal curve to the right of z = 1.44, which is about 92.5%. The probability of having at least 9 boys in Hospital 2 is approximately the area under the normal curve to the right of z = 0.95, which is about 82.7%.

Since Hospital 1 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a day, I think Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
