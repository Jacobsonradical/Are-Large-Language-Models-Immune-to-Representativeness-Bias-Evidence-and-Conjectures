{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation as to why Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

1. Let's calculate the number of babies born in each hospital on a daily basis:
   - Hospital 1: 45 babies
   - Hospital 2: 15 babies
2. Now let's find out how many babies need to be boys for the condition (more than 60% boys) to be met:
   - Hospital 1: 45 * 0.6 = 27 boys
   - Hospital 2: 15 * 0.6 = 9 boys
3. The daily percentage of baby boys in a hospital follows a binomial distribution. To estimate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a day, we can use the normal approximation for the binomial distribution.
4. We need to find the probability that the number of baby boys in a day is greater than or equal to 27 for Hospital 1 and 9 for Hospital 2.
5. The mean and standard deviation for the number of baby boys in a day are:
   - Hospital 1: Mean = 45 * 0.5 = 22.5, Standard Deviation ≈ 4.74
   - Hospital 2: Mean = 15 * 0.5 = 7.5, Standard Deviation ≈ 2.16
6. Using the normal approximation, we can calculate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a day for each hospital:
   - Hospital 1: P(X ≥ 27) ≈ 0.0021 (about 0.21% chance)
   - Hospital 2: P(X ≥ 9) ≈ 0.1646 (about 16.46% chance)
7. Since Hospital 2 has a much higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a day, it is more likely to record such days. However, the question asks for a comparison between the two hospitals in terms of the number of days with more than 60% baby boys in a year.
8. In a year, Hospital 1 has about 365 days, while Hospital 2 has about 182.5 days (assuming a leap year).
9. We can estimate the number of days with more than 60% baby boys in a year for each hospital:
   - Hospital 1: 365 * 0.0021 ≈ 0.76 (round up to 1)
   - Hospital 2: 182.5 * 0.1646 ≈ 30.01 (round down to 30)
10. Therefore, Hospital 1 is likely to record about 1 day with more than 60% baby boys, while Hospital 2 is likely to record around 30 days.

Based on this analysis, Hospital 1 is likely to record fewer days with more than 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 2.
