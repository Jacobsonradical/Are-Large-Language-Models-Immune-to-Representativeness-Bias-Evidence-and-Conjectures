{hospital: 1}

Here's an estimation approach to solve this problem:

1. On average, hospital 1 has 45 babies born per day, and hospital 2 has 15 babies born per day.
2. To have more than 60% boys in a day, we need at least 27 boys out of 45 (rounded up) in hospital 1 and at least 9 boys out of 15 in hospital 2.
3. Using the binomial probability distribution, we can estimate the probability of having more than 60% boys in a day for each hospital.
4. For hospital 1, the probability is approximately 0.076, and for hospital 2, it is approximately 0.042.
5. Over a period of 1 year, the number of days with more than 60% boys in hospital 1 is expected to be higher than in hospital 2.

So, my answer is 1, indicating that hospital 1 recorded more such days.
