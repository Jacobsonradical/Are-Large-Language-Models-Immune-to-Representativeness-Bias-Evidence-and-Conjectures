{hospital: 1}

Here's an estimate of the number of days with more than 60% boys in Hospital 1 and Hospital 2:

In Hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, we would expect 27 boys (0.6 * 45) to be born on a day with 60% boys. To find the probability of having more than 60% boys, we can use the binomial distribution. The probability of having 28 or more boys is about 0.2245 (calculated using a binomial calculator or software). Over a year (365 days), the expected number of days with more than 60% boys in Hospital 1 is approximately 365 * 0.2245 = 81.84 days.

In Hospital 2, with about 15 babies born each day, we would expect 9 boys (0.6 * 15) to be born on a day with 60% boys. The probability of having 10 or more boys is about 0.1719. Over a year (365 days), the expected number of days with more than 60% boys in Hospital 2 is approximately 365 * 0.1719 = 62.24 days.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is expected to have more days with more than 60% boys, about 82 days, compared to Hospital 2, which is expected to have about 62 days. So, the answer is 1 (Hospital 1 recorded more such days).
