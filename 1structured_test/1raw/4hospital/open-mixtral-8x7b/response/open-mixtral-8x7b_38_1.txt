{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that in Hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, and in Hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day. To find out which hospital has more days with more than 60% baby boys, let's first calculate the number of babies that would correspond to 60% of total births in each hospital:

- For Hospital 1: 60% of 45 babies = 0.6 * 45 ≈ 27 babies
- For Hospital 2: 60% of 15 babies = 0.6 * 15 = 9 babies

Now, we need to estimate how many days in a year each hospital would have more than 60% baby boys based on the calculated numbers (27 and 9). We'll assume there are 365 days in a year.

- For Hospital 1: We would need to know the distribution of baby boys on any given day. However, even if the distribution were slightly skewed towards boys, it's unlikely that Hospital 1 would have significantly more than 27 baby boys in a day. So, let's assume that Hospital 1 has at least 27 baby boys on 50% of the days, which would be around (0.5 * 365) ≈ 183 days.
- For Hospital 2: Given the smaller number of daily births, it's even less likely that Hospital 2 would have significantly more than 9 baby boys in a day. So, let's assume that Hospital 2 has at least 9 baby boys on 50% of the days, which would be around (0.5 * 365) ≈ 183 days.

Now, let's compare the number of days when each hospital has more than 60% baby boys to the total number of days when they have at least 60% baby boys (183 days).

- For Hospital 1: Since we assumed that Hospital 1 has at least 27 baby boys on 183 days, it's reasonable to assume that there will be some days with more than 60% baby boys. However, it's unlikely that this number would be significantly higher than 183 days.
- For Hospital 2: Given the smaller number of daily births, it's even less likely that Hospital 2 would have a significantly higher number of days with more than 60% baby boys than Hospital 1.

Based on this analysis, I believe that Hospital 1 would record more days with more than 60% baby boys, but the difference might not be substantial. It's possible that Hospital 2 could record a similar number of such days. Overall, I think Hospital 1 is more likely to have more days with more than 60% baby boys, but the difference would probably be within 5% of each other. So, the most accurate answer would be 3, but since I can't select that option, I will choose the closest answer, which is 1.
