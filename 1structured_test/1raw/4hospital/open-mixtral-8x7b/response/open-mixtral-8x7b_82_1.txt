{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, and in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need a larger sample size in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2. This is because the percentage of boys will vary day-to-day, and a higher number of babies born increases the chances of having a larger deviation from the average 50% rate.

To estimate the probability of having more than 60% boys in a day, we can use the binomial distribution. In Hospital 1, with an average of 45 babies per day, we would expect around 27 boys (45 * 0.5 +- sqrt(45*0.5*(1-0.5))), and the probability of having more than 27 boys is low. However, due to the larger sample size, there is still a chance that Hospital 1 will have more than 60% boys on some days.

In Hospital 2, with an average of 15 babies per day, we would expect around 7.5 boys (15 * 0.5 +- sqrt(15*0.5*(1-0.5))). Due to the smaller sample size, the daily percentage of boys will be much closer to 50%, and it's less likely that Hospital 2 will have more than 60% boys on any given day.

While we cannot calculate the exact number of days with more than 60% boys in each hospital without knowing the actual daily percentages, based on the sample sizes and the properties of the binomial distribution, we can expect Hospital 1 to have more days with more than 60% boys than Hospital 2. However, it is important to note that the exact difference in the number of such days cannot be precisely determined from the given information.
