{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, while in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need at least 27 boys in Hospital 1 (45 * 0.6) and at least 9 boys in Hospital 2 (15 * 0.6). 

To compare the probability of having more than 60% boys at each hospital, let's consider the binomial distribution since the gender of each baby is a binary outcome (boy or girl). We'll use the mean and standard deviation to approximate the likelihood of having more than 60% boys in a day.

Hospital 1:
- Mean: 45 * 0.5 = 22.5 boys
- Standard deviation: sqrt(45 * 0.5 * 0.5) ≈ 3.03 boys

Hospital 2:
- Mean: 15 * 0.5 = 7.5 boys
- Standard deviation: sqrt(15 * 0.5 * 0.5) ≈ 1.87 boys

We can see that Hospital 1 has a higher mean and standard deviation, making it more likely to have days with a higher percentage of boys. To estimate the probability of having more than 60% boys, we can use the Empirical Rule, which states that about 68% of values fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean, about 95% fall within 2 standard deviations, and about 99.7% fall within 3 standard deviations.

In Hospital 1, having more than 60% boys is about 1.43 standard deviations above the mean, so the probability is higher than 15.87% (more than 1 standard deviation). In Hospital 2, having more than 60% boys is about 3.75 standard deviations above the mean, which is extremely rare, with a probability less than 0.02%.

Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys born.
