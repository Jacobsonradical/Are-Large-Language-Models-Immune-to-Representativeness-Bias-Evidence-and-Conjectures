{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is about three times that of Hospital 2 (45 vs 15). This larger sample size in Hospital 1 increases the likelihood of observing extreme events, such as having more than 60% baby boys born on a given day. 

To estimate the difference in the number of such days between the two hospitals, let's assume a balanced distribution of baby boys and girls. We can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a single day.

For Hospital 1:
P(X > 27) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27) ≈ 0.047, where X is the number of baby boys out of 45 babies

For Hospital 2:
P(X > 9) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9) ≈ 0.027, where X is the number of baby boys out of 15 babies

Based on these calculations, Hospital 1 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys born on a given day. Furthermore, since Hospital 1 has a larger sample size, it is more likely to record more days with this extreme event.

Therefore, I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys.
