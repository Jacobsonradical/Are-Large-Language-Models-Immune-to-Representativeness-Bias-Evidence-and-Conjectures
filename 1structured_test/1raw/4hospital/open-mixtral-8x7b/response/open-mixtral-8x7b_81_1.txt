{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 births per day, while Hospital 2 has around 15. To find out if there is a difference in the number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, we can use statistical methods like the binomial proportion confidence interval.

Let's assume that the percentage of baby boys is 50% on average. We want to check if the number of days with more than 60% boys is significantly different between the two hospitals.

First, let's calculate the number of days needed for each hospital to have at least 60% boys. For Hospital 1, this would be 27 or more boys, and for Hospital 2, it would be 9 or more boys.

Now, let's calculate the probability of having at least 27 boys out of 45 births (Hospital 1) and 9 boys out of 15 births (Hospital 2) using the binomial distribution.

The probability of having 27 or more boys out of 45 births in Hospital 1 is approximately 0.022 (2.2%).
The probability of having 9 or more boys out of 15 births in Hospital 2 is approximately 0.008 (0.8%).

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys is higher in Hospital 1 (2.2%) compared to Hospital 2 (0.8%), it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more such days.

However, this doesn't account for fluctuations in the daily percentage of baby boys. Using statistical methods like the binomial proportion confidence interval, we can estimate the range of expected variation for the percentage of boys. After performing these calculations, we can conclude that the difference between the two hospitals is within a 5% margin.

Therefore, my final answer is:
{hospital: 3} They are about the same (within 5% of each other).
