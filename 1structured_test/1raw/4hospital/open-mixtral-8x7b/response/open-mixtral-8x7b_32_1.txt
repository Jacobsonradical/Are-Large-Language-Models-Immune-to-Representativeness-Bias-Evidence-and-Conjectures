{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that in Hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, and in Hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day. To find out which hospital has more days with more than 60% baby boys, we can calculate the minimum number of baby boys needed to have 60% of the daily births being boys.

For Hospital 1:
60% of 45 babies = 0.6 * 45 â‰ˆ 27 babies

For Hospital 2:
60% of 15 babies = 0.6 * 15 = 9 babies

Now let's consider that the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it's around 50%. To have more than 60% baby boys on a given day, the number of baby boys should be significantly higher than the average.

Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45 vs 15), so it is more likely to have a higher deviation from the average, resulting in more days with 60% or more baby boys. Therefore, I think Hospital 1 recorded more such days than Hospital 2.
