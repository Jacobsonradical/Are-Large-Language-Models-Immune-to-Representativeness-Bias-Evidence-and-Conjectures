{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born each day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need to determine the minimum number of baby boys required for each hospital.

For Hospital 1:
- With 45 babies born each day, 60% of them would be 27 boys. So, Hospital 1 would need at least 27 baby boys out of 45 births to meet the condition.

For Hospital 2:
- With 15 babies born each day, 60% of them would be 9 boys. So, Hospital 2 would need at least 9 baby boys out of 15 births to meet the condition.

Now let's compare the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in each hospital:

For Hospital 1:
- The average number of baby boys per day is 45 * 0.5 = 22.5 (assuming a 50% chance). However, the distribution is not consistent, and there is a higher likelihood of having days with a greater deviation from the average. Thus, Hospital 1 will have more days with more than 60% baby boys.

For Hospital 2:
- The average number of baby boys per day is 15 * 0.5 = 7.5 (assuming a 50% chance). Due to the smaller sample size, the deviation from the average will not be as significant as in Hospital 1.

Therefore, I believe that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys born.
