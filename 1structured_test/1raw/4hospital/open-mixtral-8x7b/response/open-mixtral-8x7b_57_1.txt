{hospital: 1}

Here's why:

To determine which hospital records more days with more than 60% boys, we need to compare the number of babies born in each hospital that would allow for this condition.

In hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, we would need at least 27 boys (60% of 45) to meet the criterion. On average, we would expect about 50% of those 45 babies to be boys, which is 22.5. However, since we can't have half a baby, we'll round this up to 23 boys. This means that, on any given day, there is a margin of 4 "extra" boys (27 - 23) that could potentially lead to having more than 60% boys.

In hospital 2, with about 15 babies born each day, we would need at least 9 boys (60% of 15) to meet the criterion. On average, we would expect about 50% of those 15 babies to be boys, which is 7.5. Rounding up, we have 8 boys. In this case, the margin is only 1 "extra" boy (9 - 8).

Since the difference in the number of extra boys between the two hospitals is 3 (4 - 1), and because the number of babies in hospital 1 is about three times the number in hospital 2, it's reasonable to conclude that hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys.

Using a binomial probability calculation for hospital 1, we can calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys:

P(X > 0.6 * n) = 1 - P(X <= 0.6 * n)

Where X is the number of boys and n is the total number of babies.

For hospital 1, this would be:

P(X > 0.6 * 45) = 1 - P(X <= 0.6 * 45)

= 1 - 0.0145 (1.45% chance)

Doing the same for hospital 2, we get:

P(X > 0.6 * 15) = 1 - P(X <= 0.6 * 15)

= 1 - 0.115 (11.5% chance)

So, based on the probabilities, hospital 1 indeed has fewer days where more than 60% of the babies were boys. However, the difference is not very large (1.45% vs. 11.5%). To determine if they are about the same (within 5% of each other), let's calculate their difference as a percentage of hospital 1's probability:

(11.5 - 1.45) / 1.45 â‰ˆ 7.24

This means that hospital 2 has about 7.24 times the number of days with more than 60% boys compared to hospital 1 (based on hospital 1's probability). Since this is greater than 5%, I would answer "1" for hospital 1 recording more such days.
