{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We are given that hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born each day, and hospital 2 has around 15 babies born per day. The number of days with more than 60% baby boys in each hospital will depend on the variation of the percentage of baby boys. However, since both hospitals have a 50% average (which is close to the median as well), it is expected that there will be fewer days with a high percentage of baby boys.

To estimate the number of days with more than 60% baby boys in hospital 1, let's first find the number of baby boys on an "average" day: 45 * 0.5 = 22.5 ≈ 23 boys. Now, let's assume a day with 30 baby boys, which is about 7 more than average. This would correspond to approximately 60% of the babies being boys. This day would then be recorded as having more than 60% baby boys. We can expect similar days with a few extra baby boys, which would then be recorded.

Now let's estimate the number of days in hospital 2 with more than 60% baby boys. On an "average" day, there would be 15 * 0.5 = 7.5 ≈ 8 boys. Assuming a day with 10 baby boys, which is 2 more than average, this would correspond to approximately 67% of the babies being boys, which would be recorded as having more than 60% baby boys.

Comparing the two scenarios, it seems more likely that hospital 1 would have more days with more than 60% baby boys since the daily variation in the number of babies will have a more significant impact in hospital 1 than in hospital 2. Therefore, I think hospital 1 recorded more such days.
