{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has around 15. To find out which hospital is more likely to have more than 60% boys in a day, we can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of having at least 27 boys in Hospital 1 (60% of 45) and at least 9 boys in Hospital 2 (60% of 15).

For Hospital 1, the probability of having at least 27 boys is:

P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - P(X < 27)
         ≈ 0.0324

For Hospital 2, the probability of having at least 9 boys is:

P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - P(X < 9)
         ≈ 0.0421

Based on these calculations, Hospital 2 has a slightly higher probability of having a day with more than 60% boys. However, the difference between the two probabilities is small (about 1.0% point). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the number of such days in both hospitals would be close to each other. However, since the probability for Hospital 1 is slightly lower, we can expect Hospital 1 to have fewer such days, but still within 5% of Hospital 2's number of days.

So, my answer is 1, indicating that Hospital 1 recorded fewer such days, but still within 5% of Hospital 2's number of days.
