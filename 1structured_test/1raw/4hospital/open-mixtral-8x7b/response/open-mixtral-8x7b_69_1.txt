{hospital: 1}

Here's an easy way to understand this:

1. In Hospital 1, 45 babies are born each day on average. To have more than 60% boys, there need to be at least 27 boys (45 * 0.6 = 27). This means that the number of days with more than 60% boys in Hospital 1 follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 45 and p = 0.5 (since 50% of all babies are boys).

2. In Hospital 2, 15 babies are born each day on average. To have more than 60% boys, there need to be at least 9 boys (15 * 0.6 = 9). Here, the number of days with more than 60% boys follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 15 and p = 0.5.

3. Now let's compare the expected number of such days in both hospitals. For Hospital 1, it's approximately 13.69 days per year (45*0.5^45*0.5^(45-45)*45 ≈ 13.69), and for Hospital 2, it's approximately 2.15 days per year (15*0.5^15*0.5^(15-15)*15 ≈ 2.15).

4. Therefore, Hospital 1 is expected to have around 6 times more days with more than 60% boys than Hospital 2. Although the exact percentages will vary day-to-day, they are not likely to be within 5% of each other, so the answer is option 1 - Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
