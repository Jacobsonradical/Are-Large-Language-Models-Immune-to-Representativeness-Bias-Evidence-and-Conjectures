{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has about 15. To find out if there is a difference in the number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, we can use a binomial distribution to estimate the probability of having such days.

Let's first calculate the expected number of baby boys for each hospital in a day:
Hospital 1: 45 * 0.5 = 22.5 
Hospital 2: 15 * 0.5 = 7.5

Now, let's calculate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a day for each hospital, which means having at least 27 baby boys in Hospital 1 and at least 5 baby boys in Hospital 2.

Hospital 1: P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - P(X < 27) = 1 - ∑(n=0 to 26) C(45, n) * (0.5)^n * (0.5)^(45-n) ≈ 0.0031

Hospital 2: P(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) = 1 - ∑(n=0 to 4) C(15, n) * (0.5)^n * (0.5)^(15-n) ≈ 0.0335

Now, let's calculate the number of days in a year (assuming 365 days) where the probability is met:

Hospital 1: Expected days = 365 * 0.0031 ≈ 1.12
Hospital 2: Expected days = 365 * 0.0335 ≈ 12.21

Based on this calculation, we can expect Hospital 2 to have more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. However, since Hospital 1 still has around 1 day with such occurrences, the difference is not large enough to conclude that Hospital 1 has significantly fewer days. Nonetheless, Hospital 2 is still the most likely to have more days with a higher percentage of baby boys.

Therefore, I choose option 1, as Hospital 1 has fewer days where more than 60% of the babies are boys, but the difference is not large enough to be considered "about the same" as Hospital 2 within 5%.
