{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that in Hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, and in Hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day. To find out which hospital has more days with more than 60% baby boys, let's calculate the number of days with such a percentage in each hospital.

In Hospital 1, we would need at least 27 babies to be boys (0.6 * 45) for a day to qualify. The probability of having 27 or more boys in a day can be estimated using the binomial probability formula:

P(X ≥ 27) = Σ P(X = i) for i = 27 to 45

With the average of 50% baby boys, the probability of having a baby boy is 0.5, and the probability of having a baby girl is also 0.5.

Calculating the binomial probability for Hospital 1 gives us approximately 0.0031 or 0.31% chance per day.

In Hospital 2, we would need at least 9 babies to be boys (0.6 * 15) for a day to qualify. The probability of having 9 or more boys in a day can be estimated using the binomial probability formula as well.

P(X ≥ 9) = Σ P(X = i) for i = 9 to 15

Calculating the binomial probability for Hospital 2 gives us approximately 0.0277 or 2.77% chance per day.

Now, let's compare the number of days with more than 60% baby boys in each hospital over a period of 1 year (365 days).

Days in Hospital 1: 365 * 0.0031 ≈ 1.12
Days in Hospital 2: 365 * 0.0277 ≈ 10.05

Hospital 2 has approximately 10 days with more than 60% baby boys, while Hospital 1 has about 1 day with such a percentage. Therefore, I think Hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys.
