{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We are given that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 births per day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 births per day. To find out which hospital is more likely to have more than 60% boys on a given day, we can use the binomial probability formula for a single day.

For Hospital 1:
p = probability of a boy (0.5)
n = number of births (45)
q = probability of a girl (1 - p = 0.5)

We want to find the probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45):
P(X > 27) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27)

Using the binomial probability formula or normal approximation, we can calculate the probability of having 27 or fewer boys in Hospital 1. However, this calculation is not necessary since we only need to compare the probabilities between Hospital 1 and Hospital 2.

For Hospital 2:
p = probability of a boy (0.5)
n = number of births (15)
q = probability of a girl (1 - p = 0.5)

We want to find the probability of having more than 9 boys (60% of 15):
P(X > 9) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9)

Using the same reasoning as above, we can calculate the probability of having 9 or fewer boys in Hospital 2.

Now, we can compare the probabilities for Hospital 1 and Hospital 2:

- For Hospital 1, the number of births is higher, but the probability of having more than 60% boys is smaller than in Hospital 2.
- For Hospital 2, the number of births is lower, but the probability of having more than 60% boys is higher than in Hospital 1.

Since the number of births in Hospital 1 is about three times higher than in Hospital 2, the actual difference in the probabilities will be small. However, due to the lower number of births, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more than 60% boys on a given day than Hospital 1.

Therefore, I think Hospital 2 recorded more such days (option 2). However, since the difference in probabilities is small, it is possible that they are about the same within 5% of each other (option 3). Option 1 is not correct since Hospital 1 has a lower probability of having more than 60% boys.
