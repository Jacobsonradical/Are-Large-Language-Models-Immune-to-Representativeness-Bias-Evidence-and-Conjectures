{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, while in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need a larger sample size since the percentage of boys can fluctuate. 

Let's calculate the minimum number of babies needed to have at least 60% boys:
- For Hospital 1: 0.6 * 45 = 27 boys, which means at least 18 girls would also need to be born on that day.
- For Hospital 2: 0.6 * 15 = 9 boys, which means at least 6 girls would also need to be born on that day.

We can see that Hospital 1 has a much higher chance of having days with more than 60% boys just based on the raw numbers. While the exact percentage may vary, it is highly likely that Hospital 1 will have more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%. Therefore, my answer is Hospital 1.
