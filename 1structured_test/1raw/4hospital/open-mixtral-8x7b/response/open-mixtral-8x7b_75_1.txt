{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is approximately three times that of Hospital 2 (45 vs. 15). This increases the likelihood that Hospital 1 will have days with a higher percentage of baby boys since there are more births overall.

To estimate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a single day, we can use the binomial distribution. Assuming 50% probability of having a boy, the probability of having 27 or more boys out of 45 births is approximately 0.047 (4.7%). Similarly, for Hospital 2, the probability of having 10 or more boys out of 15 births is approximately 0.022 (2.2%).

Since Hospital 1 has more births and a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys, it is more likely to record more such days compared to Hospital 2. To determine whether they are about the same (within 5% of each other), we would need to simulate or calculate the probabilities for an entire year, which is beyond the scope of this question. However, based on the provided information, I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys.
