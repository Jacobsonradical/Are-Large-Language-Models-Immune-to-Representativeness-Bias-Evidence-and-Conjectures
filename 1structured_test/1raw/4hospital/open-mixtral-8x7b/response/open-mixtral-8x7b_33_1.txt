{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has about 15. To find out which hospital is more likely to have more than 60% boys in a day, we can use the binomial probability formula.

For Hospital 1:
p = probability of a baby being a boy (0.5)
n = number of babies born in a day (45)
q = probability of a baby being a girl (1 - p = 0.5)

We want to find the probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45) in a day:
P(X > 27) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27)

Using the binomial probability formula or a calculator, we get:
P(X > 27) ≈ 0.0387

For Hospital 2:
p = probability of a baby being a boy (0.5)
n = number of babies born in a day (15)
q = probability of a baby being a girl (1 - p = 0.5)

We want to find the probability of having more than 9 boys (60% of 15) in a day:
P(X > 9) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9)

Using the binomial probability formula or a calculator, we get:
P(X > 9) ≈ 0.1074

Comparing the probabilities, Hospital 1 has a lower probability of having more than 60% boys in a day (3.87%) compared to Hospital 2 (10.74%). Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded fewer such days, making it reasonable to assume that Hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% boys.

However, to determine if they are about the same (within 5% of each other), we would compare the number of days with the 5% threshold. To do this, we need to calculate the expected number of days for each hospital based on their daily birth rates and the 5% threshold.

For Hospital 1:
Expected number of days = 365 days * 0.0387 ≈ 14.05 days

For Hospital 2:
Expected number of days = 365 days * 0.1074 ≈ 39.11 days

The difference between the expected number of days is 25.06 days, which is more than 5% of the total days in a year (18.25 days). Therefore, we can conclude that Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% boys compared to Hospital 1, and they are not about the same within a 5% margin.

Thus, my answer is {hospital: 1}, indicating that Hospital 1 recorded fewer such days compared to Hospital 2.
