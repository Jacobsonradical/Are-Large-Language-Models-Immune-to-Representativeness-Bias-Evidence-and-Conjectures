{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that in Hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, and in Hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day. To find out which hospital is more likely to have more than 60% baby boys in a day, we can use probability.

In Hospital 1, with 45 babies born per day, we would expect about 22.5 (45 * 0.5) babies to be boys on average. For more than 60% of the babies to be boys, we would need at least 27.1 (45 * 0.601) baby boys. Using the binomial probability formula, the probability of having 27, 28, 29, ..., 45 baby boys in a day is:

P(27+) = P(X ≥ 27) = Σ(P(X = i)), where i ranges from 27 to 45

Calculating this probability is not straightforward, but using a binomial distribution calculator or software, we can estimate the value.

Similarly, for Hospital 2, with 15 babies born per day, we would expect about 7.5 (15 * 0.5) babies to be boys on average. For more than 60% of the babies to be boys, we would need at least 9 (15 * 0.601) baby boys. Again, using the binomial probability formula, the probability of having 9, 10, 11, ..., 15 baby boys in a day is:

P(9+) = P(X ≥ 9) = Σ(P(X = i)), where i ranges from 9 to 15

Now, let's compare the probabilities P(27+) and P(9+). Intuitively, Hospital 1 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a day due to the larger number of babies born. However, to confirm this, we would need to compute the exact probabilities using statistical methods or software.

Based on the higher number of babies born in Hospital 1, and assuming similar randomness in the gender distribution, I believe Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys.

Please note that this is a probabilistic answer, and actual results may vary. However, I think Hospital 1 is the most likely candidate for recording more such days.
