{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, and in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. In order for more than 60% of the babies to be boys, there would need to be at least 27 boys born in a single day in Hospital 1 (since 0.6 * 45 = 27) and at least 9 boys born in Hospital 2 (since 0.6 * 15 = 9).

To estimate the probability of having more than 60% boys on any given day, we can use the binomial probability formula. For Hospital 1, assuming a 50% chance of a boy being born, the probability of having 27 or more boys out of 45 births is approximately 0.078 or 7.8%. For Hospital 2, the probability of having 9 or more boys out of 15 births is approximately 0.033 or 3.3%.

Now, let's compare the number of days with more than 60% boys in each hospital over a period of 1 year (365 days). We would expect Hospital 1 to have around 28.55 such days (365 * 0.078), while Hospital 2 would have approximately 12.04 days (365 * 0.033).

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys born, with approximately 16 more days than Hospital 2, which is not within the 5% range. So, my answer is Hospital 1.
