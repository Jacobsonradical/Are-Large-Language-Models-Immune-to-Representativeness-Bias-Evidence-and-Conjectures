{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

1. Let's assume that the percentage of baby boys is around 50% on average for both hospitals. This means that out of 45 babies in hospital 1, we can expect about 22-23 baby boys on a given day.
2. To have more than 60% baby boys, we would need at least 27 boys out of 45 births. The probability of this happening on any given day is relatively low (approximately 7.5%), but since there are 365 days in a year, it's possible that it could happen multiple times.
3. Hospital 1 has a higher number of daily births, which increases the chances of having larger variations in the number of baby boys born.
4. In hospital 2, with only 15 births per day, the standard deviation for the number of baby boys is much smaller. This reduces the likelihood of having days with significantly higher than 50% baby boys.
5. While it's still possible for hospital 2 to have a few days with more than 60% baby boys, the overall probability is lower compared to hospital 1.
6. Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 1 recorded more such days (days with more than 60% baby boys) than hospital 2.
