{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is about three times that of Hospital 2 (45 vs 15). Since the exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, let's consider two extreme cases - a day with only boys being born and a day with only girls being born. 

In Hospital 1, on a day with only boys being born, there would be 45 baby boys out of 45 births, which is 100%. Similarly, on a day with only girls being born, there would be 0% baby boys. 

Now let's look at Hospital 2. On a day with only boys being born, there would still be 100% baby boys, but since only 15 babies are born, it would take six such days (with 15 boys each day) to reach the same total number of babies as Hospital 1 had on its single 'all-boys' day (6 x 15 = 90, still less than 45 * 60% = 27). Therefore, Hospital 2 is less likely to have more than 60% baby boys in a day.

On the other hand, Hospital 1 has a much higher chance of having more than 60% baby boys in a day due to its larger sample size. To calculate this, we can use the binomial probability formula for a single day:

P(X >= 27) = Î£(P(X=k) where k ranges from 27 to 45)

Although calculating the exact value is cumbersome, we can see that Hospital 1 has a significantly higher chance of having more than 60% baby boys in a day compared to Hospital 2. Hence, I think Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
