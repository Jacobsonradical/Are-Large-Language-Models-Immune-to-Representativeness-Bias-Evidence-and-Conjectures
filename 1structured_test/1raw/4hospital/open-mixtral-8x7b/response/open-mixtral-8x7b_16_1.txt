{hospital: 1}

Here's my reasoning:

We're given that Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day. To find out how many baby boys are born on a given day in each hospital, we can use the binomial distribution with a probability of success (boy) equal to 0.5.

Let's calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys (27 or more) in Hospital 1:
P(X ≥ 27) = Σ P(X = i) for i = 27 to 45

Using the binomial probability formula, we get P(X ≥ 27) ≈ 0.067

Now, let's do the same calculation for Hospital 2:
P(X ≥ 9) = Σ P(X = i) for i = 9 to 15

We get P(X ≥ 9) ≈ 0.082

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys is higher in Hospital 2, we might initially think that Hospital 2 would record more such days. However, due to the larger number of babies born in Hospital 1, even though the probability is lower, the expected number of days with more than 60% boys is still higher in Hospital 1.

The expected number of days with more than 60% boys in Hospital 1 is approximately 45 * 0.067 ≈ 3.02, and in Hospital 2 is approximately 15 * 0.082 ≈ 1.23.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys.
