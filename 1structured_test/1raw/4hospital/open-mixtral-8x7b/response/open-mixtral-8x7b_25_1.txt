{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that in Hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, and in Hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need to have at least 27 boys in Hospital 1 (45 * 0.6) and at least 9 boys in Hospital 2 (15 * 0.6).

Let's first calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys in Hospital 1. To make calculations simpler, let's round the daily births to 45 (instead of approximately 45). We can approximate the number of daily baby boys in Hospital 1 using a binomial distribution. The mean number of boys is 45 * 0.5 = 22.5, and the standard deviation is sqrt(45 * 0.5 * 0.5) ≈ 3.03. The probability of having at least 27 boys is approximately the same as the probability of having 26 or more boys, since the probability of having exactly 27 boys is very small. According to the cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution, the probability of having 26 or more boys is approximately 0.1441, or about 14.41%.

Now, let's calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys in Hospital 2. Again, let's simplify the calculation by rounding the daily births to 15 (instead of approximately 15). The mean number of boys is 15 * 0.5 = 7.5, and the standard deviation is sqrt(15 * 0.5 * 0.5) ≈ 1.87. The probability of having at least 9 boys is approximately the same as the probability of having 8 or more boys, since the probability of having exactly 9 boys is very small. According to the cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution, the probability of having 8 or more boys is approximately 0.331, or about 33.1%.

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys in Hospital 2 is significantly higher than in Hospital 1, it is likely that Hospital 2 recorded more such days. Therefore, my answer is Hospital 1 (option 1).
