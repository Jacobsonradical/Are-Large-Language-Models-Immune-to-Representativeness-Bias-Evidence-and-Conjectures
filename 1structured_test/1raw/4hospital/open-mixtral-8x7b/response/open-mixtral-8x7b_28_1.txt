{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 births per day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 births per day. To find out how many days each hospital would record more than 60% boys, we can use a binomial distribution model.

For Hospital 1, the probability of having 27 or more boys in a day (60% of 45) is calculated as follows:

P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - P(X < 27)

Using the binom.dist function in Excel, we get P(X ≥ 27) ≈ 0.0167 (1.67%). So, Hospital 1 would record such days about once every 60 days.

For Hospital 2, the probability of having 9 or more boys in a day (60% of 15) is calculated as follows:

P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - P(X < 9)

Using the same method, we get P(X ≥ 9) ≈ 0.0703 (7.03%). So, Hospital 2 would record such days about once every 14 days.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys, compared to Hospital 1.
