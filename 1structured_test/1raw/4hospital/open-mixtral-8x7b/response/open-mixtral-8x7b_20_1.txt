{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

Let's calculate the number of days with more than 60% baby boys for each hospital in a year (assuming 365 days).

For Hospital 1:
On average, there are (0.5 * 45) = 22.5 boys born per day. Since we can't have half a baby, let's round it to 23 boys.
We need at least 28 boys to have more than 60% baby boys in a day (28/45 = 0.62 > 0.6).
The probability of having 28 or more boys in a day is given by the binomial distribution.
Using a binomial calculator, the probability of having 28, 29, 30, ..., 45 boys in a day is approximately 0.271 or 27.1%.

For Hospital 2:
On average, there are (0.5 * 15) = 7.5 boys born per day. Rounding it to 8 boys.
We need at least 9 boys to have more than 60% baby boys in a day (9/15 = 0.6 > 0.6).
The probability of having 9, 10, 11, ..., 15 boys in a day is approximately 0.368 or 36.8%.

Comparing both probabilities, Hospital 2 has a higher chance of having more than 60% baby boys in a day. Therefore, Hospital 2 is likely to record more such days than Hospital 1.
