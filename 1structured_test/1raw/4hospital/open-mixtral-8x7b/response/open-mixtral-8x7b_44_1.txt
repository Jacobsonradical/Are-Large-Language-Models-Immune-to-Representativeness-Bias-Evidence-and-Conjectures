{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, while in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. To find out if there's a difference between the number of days with more than 60% baby boys, we can perform a rough calculation.

First, let's determine the minimum number of baby boys needed for a day to be counted:
- Hospital 1: 45 * 0.6 = 27 baby boys
- Hospital 2: 15 * 0.6 = 9 baby boys

Now, let's calculate the probability of having such a day in each hospital:
- Hospital 1: With a 50% chance of a baby being a boy, we can approximate the probability using the binomial distribution. The probability of having at least 27 boys out of 45 births is approximately 0.174 (or 17.4%).
- Hospital 2: Similarly, the probability of having at least 9 boys out of 15 births is approximately 0.154 (or 15.4%).

Since the probability of having a day with more than 60% baby boys is slightly higher in Hospital 1, it is more likely to record more such days than Hospital 2 over a period of 1 year. However, keep in mind that this is a rough estimation, and the actual number of days may vary depending on the exact percentage of baby boys born on each day.
