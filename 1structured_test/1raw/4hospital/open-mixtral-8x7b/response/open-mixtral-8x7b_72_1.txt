{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, and in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. In order for more than 60% of the babies to be boys on any given day, there would need to be at least 27 boys born in Hospital 1 (45 * 0.6 = 27) and at least 9 boys born in Hospital 2 (15 * 0.6 = 9). 

We also know that about 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day. According to the Central Limit Theorem, as the number of babies born in a hospital approaches 30, the distribution of the percentage of baby boys born on any given day will become more normal. 

However, since Hospital 1 has nearly twice as many births per day as Hospital 2, the distribution of the percentage of baby boys born in Hospital 1 will be narrower than that of Hospital 2. This means that Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys born is higher or lower than the average, while Hospital 2 will have a smaller range of daily percentages.

Given this information, it's more likely that Hospital 1 will have more days where the percentage of baby boys born is above 60%, since its distribution is wider. Therefore, I think Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
