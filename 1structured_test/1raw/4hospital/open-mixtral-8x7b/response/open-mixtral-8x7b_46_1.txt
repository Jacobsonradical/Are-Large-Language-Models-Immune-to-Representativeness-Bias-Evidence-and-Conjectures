{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 babies born each day, and Hospital 2 has around 15 babies born per day. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need to have at least 27 boys in Hospital 1 (45 * 0.6) and at least 9 boys in Hospital 2 (15 * 0.6). 

Let's calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys born in each hospital. We'll use the binomial probability formula for this:

P(X ≥ k) = Σ (C(n, k) * p^k * q^(n-k))

where n is the number of trials (births), k is the minimum number of successes (boy births), p is the probability of success (probability of a boy birth), and q is the probability of failure (probability of a girl birth).

For Hospital 1, the probability of having more than 60% boys born in a day is roughly 0.0146 (calculated using the binomial probability formula with n=45, k=27, and p=0.5).

For Hospital 2, the probability of having more than 60% boys born in a day is roughly 0.0007 (calculated using the binomial probability formula with n=15, k=9, and p=0.5).

Now, let's compare the number of days with more than 60% boys born in each hospital over a period of 1 year (365 days).

Hospital 1: Expected number of days = 365 * 0.0146 ≈ 5.3
Hospital 2: Expected number of days = 365 * 0.0007 ≈ 0.25

Therefore, Hospital 1 is expected to have many more days with more than 60% boys born compared to Hospital 2. Hence, my answer is Hospital 1.
