{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

1. The number of baby boys in a day follows a binomial distribution with parameters n (number of births) and p (probability of a baby boy, which is approximately 0.5).
2. We are looking for days where the proportion of baby boys exceeds 60%, which is equivalent to the number of baby boys being greater than or equal to 0.6n.
3. The probability of having at least 0.6n baby boys in a day depends on n. For larger n (like in Hospital 1), this probability is higher than for smaller n (like in Hospital 2). This is because the distribution becomes more concentrated around the mean (n*p) as n increases, making extreme values (like having 0.6n baby boys) more likely.
4. Thus, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days with more than 60% baby boys than Hospital 2. However, without having the actual data, we cannot provide precise numbers or percentages.
