{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why I think Hospital 1 recorded more such days:

To determine this, we need to compare the number of days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys in each hospital. Let's calculate the minimum and maximum percentage of baby boys on any given day for each hospital.

Hospital 1:
- Minimum: 0.5 * 45 = 22.5 (rounding up to 23 since there cannot be half a baby)
- Maximum: 0.5 * 45 + 0.1 * 45 = 33.75 (rounding down to 33 since there cannot be a quarter of a baby)

Hospital 2:
- Minimum: 0.5 * 15 = 7.5 (rounding up to 8 since there cannot be half a baby)
- Maximum: 0.5 * 15 + 0.1 * 15 = 16.5 (rounding down to 16 since there cannot be a quarter of a baby)

Now, let's find the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in each hospital:

Hospital 1:
P(>60% boys) = P(34 to 45 boys) = ∑(i=34 to 45) C(45, i) * 0.5^45 * 0.5^(45-i)

Hospital 2:
P(>60% boys) = P(9 to 15 boys) = ∑(i=9 to 15) C(15, i) * 0.5^15 * 0.5^(15-i)

We can see that due to the larger number of babies born in Hospital 1, it has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys on any given day compared to Hospital 2. Therefore, I believe Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
