{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, and in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need a larger sample size in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2.

Let's calculate the minimum number of babies needed for a 60% boy ratio:
- To have 60% boys, we need at least 27 boys out of 45 births in Hospital 1 (60% of 45 is approximately 27).
- However, in Hospital 2, we only need 9 boys out of 15 births to reach a 60% boy ratio (60% of 15 is approximately 9).

Now, let's calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys in a day for each hospital. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:

P(X ≥ successes) = Σ(P(X = k) for k = successes to n)

where n is the total number of trials (births), p is the probability of success (probability of a boy), and X is the number of successes (number of boy babies).

For Hospital 1, with n = 45 and p = 0.5 (since the percentage of baby boys varies and we're looking for the worst-case scenario), we can calculate the probability of having 27 or more boy babies:

P(X ≥ 27) = P(X = 27) + P(X = 28) + ... + P(X = 45)

Similarly, for Hospital 2, with n = 15 and p = 0.5, we can calculate the probability of having 9 or more boy babies:

P(X ≥ 9) = P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) + ... + P(X = 15)

Using a statistical calculator, we find that:

P(X ≥ 27) ≈ 0.015 (1.5%)
P(X ≥ 9) ≈ 0.117 (11.7%)

Since Hospital 2 has a significantly higher probability of having more than 60% boys born in a day, it is more likely to record more such days. However, it is essential to note that these probabilities are not extremely low or high, so there is still a chance that Hospital 1 could record a similar number of days with more than 60% boys born. Nonetheless, considering the differences in daily births and probabilities, I believe Hospital 2 will record more days with more than 60% boys born.
