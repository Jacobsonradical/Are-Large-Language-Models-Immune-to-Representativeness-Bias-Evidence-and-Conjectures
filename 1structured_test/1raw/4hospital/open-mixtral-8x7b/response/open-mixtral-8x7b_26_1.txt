{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, and in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. To find out if there's a difference between the two hospitals in terms of recording more days with more than 60% baby boys, we can use a binomial distribution model.

First, let's assume that the percentage of baby boys is indeed 50% on average. Then, we can calculate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day for each hospital.

In Hospital 1, with approximately 45 babies born per day, we want to find P(X > 27), where X is the number of baby boys and follows a binomial distribution with n = 45 and p = 0.5.

In Hospital 2, with approximately 15 babies born per day, we want to find P(X > 9), where X is the number of baby boys and follows a binomial distribution with n = 15 and p = 0.5.

Using a binomial distribution calculator, we find that P(X > 27) ≈ 0.012 for Hospital 1, and P(X > 9) ≈ 0.034 for Hospital 2.

Now, we need to compare the probabilities to determine which hospital is more likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys. Since 0.034 > 0.012, Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day.

However, to determine if Hospital 1 records significantly more or fewer such days, we can calculate the ratio of the two probabilities:

Ratio = P(Hospital 1) / P(Hospital 2) ≈ 0.012 / 0.034 ≈ 0.353

Since this ratio is less than 2, the difference between the two hospitals in terms of recording more days with more than 60% baby boys is not substantial. Therefore, I believe that neither hospital records significantly more or fewer such days, and they are about the same (within 5% of each other). However, if I have to choose, I would go with Hospital 1 recording slightly fewer such days, so my answer is {hospital: 1}.
