{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, and in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. To find out if there is a difference between the hospitals regarding days with more than 60% baby boys, we can calculate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in each hospital.

In Hospital 1, with approximately 45 babies born per day, we would expect around 27 boys (0.5 * 45 + 0.5) on a day with a 50% ratio of boys. To have more than 60% baby boys, we need at least 27 babies to be boys. We can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of having at least 27 boys out of 45 babies:

P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - P(X < 27)

Using a binomial calculator or approximation, we get a probability of approximately 0.0417 or 4.17% for this event.

In Hospital 2, with approximately 15 babies born per day, we would expect around 8 boys (0.5 * 15 + 0.5) on a day with a 50% ratio of boys. To have more than 60% baby boys, we need at least 9 boys. Calculating the probability of having at least 9 boys out of 15 babies, we get:

P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - P(X < 9)

The probability is approximately 0.1074 or 10.74%.

Comparing the probabilities, we see that Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a day. Therefore, I believe Hospital 2 recorded more such days than Hospital 1.
