{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We are given that Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day. We want to find the days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

Let's first calculate the number of baby boys needed for a day to be counted as having "more than 60% baby boys" in each hospital:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies * 0.6 = 27 baby boys
- Hospital 2: 15 babies * 0.6 = 9 baby boys

Now let's calculate the probability of having more than 27 baby boys in Hospital 1 and more than 9 baby boys in Hospital 2, using the 50% overall probability of a baby being a boy:

- Hospital 1: The probability of having at least 27 baby boys is calculated using the binomial distribution. The probability of having exactly 27 boys is approximately 0.188. To find the probability of having more than 27 boys, we sum the probabilities of having 28 or more boys. This results in a probability of approximately 0.065.

- Hospital 2: The probability of having at least 9 baby boys is calculated similarly. The probability of having exactly 9 boys is approximately 0.265. The probability of having more than 9 boys is approximately 0.146.

Comparing the two probabilities, we can see that Hospital 1 has a lower probability (0.065) of having more than 60% baby boys than Hospital 2 (0.146). This suggests that Hospital 2 is more likely to have days with more than 60% baby boys.

However, we are asked to compare the number of such days within 5% of each other. To estimate this, we can calculate the expected number of days with more than 60% baby boys in each hospital over a year (assuming 365 days).

- Hospital 1: Expected number of days = 365 days * 0.065 ≈ 23.9 days
- Hospital 2: Expected number of days = 365 days * 0.146 ≈ 53.2 days

The difference between the expected number of days is approximately 29.3 days, which is significantly more than 5%. Therefore, I believe that Hospital 2 recorded more such days than Hospital 1.

Hence, my answer is {hospital: 1}, indicating that Hospital 1 recorded fewer days with more than 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 2.
