{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, while in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. To find out if there's a difference between the hospitals in terms of the number of days with more than 60% baby boys, we can use the binomial distribution to estimate the probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45) in Hospital 1 and more than 9 boys (60% of 15) in Hospital 2.

In Hospital 1, the probability of having more than 27 boys is approximately 0.032, calculated using the binomial distribution with p=0.5 (since 50% of babies are boys on average).

In Hospital 2, the probability of having more than 9 boys is approximately 0.139, also calculated using the binomial distribution with p=0.5.

Now let's compare these probabilities. Hospital 1 has a lower probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a day. This means that, on average, such events are rarer in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2.

However, due to the larger number of babies born in Hospital 1, there will be more days with more than 60% baby boys in Hospital 1 than in Hospital 2. To estimate the difference, let's calculate the expected number of days with more than 60% baby boys in each hospital over a period of one year (assuming 365 days).

In Hospital 1, the expected number of days would be 365 * 0.032 ≈ 11.62 days.

In Hospital 2, the expected number of days would be 365 * 0.139 ≈ 50.835 days.

Considering the difference in expected days with more than 60% baby boys between the hospitals, I think Hospital 1 recorded fewer such days than Hospital 2, but not significantly less. The difference between 11.62 days and 50.835 days is quite large, but when accounting for a 5% margin of error, it's possible that the actual number of days in Hospital 1 could be up to 5.81 days more, making it around 17.43 days. This is still significantly less than the 50.835 days estimated for Hospital 2.

Therefore, I think Hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys than Hospital 1, and the difference is unlikely to be within a 5% margin of error.
