{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

To determine which hospital records more days with more than 60% baby boys, we need to compare the probability of having at least 60% boys on a given day in each hospital. 

In hospital 1, 45 babies are born each day, and about 50% of them are boys on average. Using the binomial distribution, we can calculate the probability of having at least 27 boys (60% of 45) on a given day:

P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - P(X < 27)

where X is the number of baby boys and P(X < 27) can be calculated using the binom.dist function in Excel or a similar tool. This results in a probability of approximately 0.067 or 6.7%.

In hospital 2, 15 babies are born each day, and about 50% of them are boys on average. Using the same approach as above, we can calculate the probability of having at least 9 boys (60% of 15) on a given day:

P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - P(X < 9)

This results in a probability of approximately 0.096 or 9.6%.

Comparing the two probabilities, hospital 2 has a higher probability of having at least 60% baby boys on a given day than hospital 1. Therefore, we can expect hospital 2 to record more such days than hospital 1, assuming similar recording practices and sample sizes.

However, the difference between the two probabilities is about 2.9 percentage points, which is less than 5%. Therefore, the number of days recorded by each hospital may be somewhat close, but hospital 2 is still expected to record more such days than hospital 1, given the higher probability.
