{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

We know that about 50% of all babies are boys, but this percentage varies from day to day. To have more than 60% baby boys, there needs to be a higher variation in the number of baby boys born compared to the number of baby girls.

Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). This means that Hospital 1 is more likely to have a larger sample size on any given day, which increases the chances of observing a higher variation in the number of baby boys born.

While it's possible that Hospital 2 might have more days with more than 60% baby boys due to an unusually high variation, it is less likely compared to Hospital 1. Therefore, I believe Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
