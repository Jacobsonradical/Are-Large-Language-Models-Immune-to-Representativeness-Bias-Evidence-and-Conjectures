{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has approximately 45 baby births per day, while Hospital 2 has about 15. To find out if there is a difference in the number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, we can use a binomial distribution model.

For Hospital 1, let's calculate the probability of having more than 27 boys (60% of 45) on a given day:

P(X >= 27) = 1 - P(X < 27)
          = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 26)]

where X is the number of baby boys and follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 45 and p = 0.5.

Calculating this probability using a statistical calculator or software, we get P(X >= 27) ≈ 0.024. So, Hospital 1 would record about 2.4% of days with more than 60% baby boys.

Similarly, for Hospital 2, let's calculate the probability of having more than 9 boys (60% of 15) on a given day:

P(X >= 9) = 1 - P(X < 9)
          = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 8)]

where X is the number of baby boys and follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 15 and p = 0.5.

Calculating this probability, we get P(X >= 9) ≈ 0.098. So, Hospital 2 would record about 9.8% of days with more than 60% baby boys.

Comparing the two probabilities, we see that Hospital 2 is more likely to have more than 60% baby boys on a given day than Hospital 1. Therefore, Hospital 2 would record more such days than Hospital 1.
