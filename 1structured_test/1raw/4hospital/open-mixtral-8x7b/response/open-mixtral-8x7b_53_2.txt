{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is about three times that of Hospital 2 (45 vs 15). This increases the likelihood of extreme fluctuations in the proportion of baby boys in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2.

Let's calculate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a single day for each hospital. We'll use the binomial distribution to model the number of baby boys in a day.

Hospital 1:
- Mean = np = 45 * 0.5 = 22.5
- Standard deviation = sqrt(np(1-p)) ≈ 4.04
- Probability of having more than 27 baby boys (60% of 45) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27) ≈ 0.124 (12.4%)

Hospital 2:
- Mean = np = 15 * 0.5 = 7.5
- Standard deviation = sqrt(np(1-p)) ≈ 1.87
- Probability of having more than 9 baby boys (60% of 15) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9) ≈ 0.063 (6.3%)

Based on the above calculations, Hospital 1 has a higher probability (approximately 12.4%) of having more than 60% baby boys in a single day compared to Hospital 2 (approximately 6.3%). Therefore, I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys.
