{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

To determine which hospital records more days with more than 60% baby boys, we need to compare the probability of having at least 60% boys on any given day. 

In hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, we'd need at least 27 boys to have more than 60% baby boys (27 boys out of 45 total babies). Using the binomial probability formula and assuming a 50% chance of a boy or girl, we find that the probability of having at least 27 boys in a day is approximately 0.1775.

In hospital 2, with about 15 babies born each day, we'd need at least 9 boys to have more than 60% baby boys (9 boys out of 15 total babies). The probability of having at least 9 boys in a day is approximately 0.1643.

Since the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is higher in hospital 1, it is more likely that hospital 1 will record more such days. To confirm if the difference is within 5%, we can calculate the relative difference:

(0.1775 - 0.1643) / 0.1775 â‰ˆ 0.0738, or 7.38%

The relative difference between the two probabilities is indeed greater than 5%, so I would choose option 1, indicating that hospital 1 recorded more such days.
