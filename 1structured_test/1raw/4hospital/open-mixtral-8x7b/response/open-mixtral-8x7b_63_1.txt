{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is around 45 per day, while in Hospital 2 it's about 15 per day. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, we need at least 27 boys in Hospital 1 (45 * 0.6) and at least 9 boys in Hospital 2 (15 * 0.6). 

Let's calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys in each hospital. We'll use the binomial distribution to find the probability of having at least 27 boys in Hospital 1 and at least 9 boys in Hospital 2.

For Hospital 1:
P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - P(X < 27)
P(X < 27) = P(X ≤ 26) = Σ(i=0 to 26) (45 choose i) * (0.5)^i * (0.5)^(45-i) ≈ 0.27
P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - 0.27 = 0.73

For Hospital 2:
P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - P(X < 9)
P(X < 9) = P(X ≤ 8) = Σ(i=0 to 8) (15 choose i) * (0.5)^i * (0.5)^(15-i) ≈ 0.18
P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - 0.18 = 0.82

So, Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day. However, the question asks which hospital recorded more such days in a year. Since we don't have the exact data on daily gender distribution, we cannot give a definitive answer. But we can estimate the number of days with more than 60% boys in each hospital based on their probabilities.

Assuming 365 days in a year, we can expect about 263 days with more than 60% boys in Hospital 1 (365 * 0.73) and about 300 days in Hospital 2 (365 * 0.82). Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 2 recorded more such days, but there is a chance that the number of days is within 5% of each other, so the correct answer is:

{hospital: 1} with a note: There is a small possibility that the number of days is within 5% of each other.
