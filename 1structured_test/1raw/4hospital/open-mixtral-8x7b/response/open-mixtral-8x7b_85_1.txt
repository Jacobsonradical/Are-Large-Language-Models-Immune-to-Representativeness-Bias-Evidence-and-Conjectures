{hospital: 1}

Here's my reasoning:

We know that Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day. In order to have more than 60% boys born on a given day, there needs to be a higher than average number of boy babies.

Let's calculate the minimum number of boy babies needed for each hospital to reach the 60% threshold:

- Hospital 1: 45 babies * 0.6 = 27 boys
- Hospital 2: 15 babies * 0.6 = 9 boys

Now let's consider the distribution of boys and girls. Even though the percentage of boys varies from day to day, it's unlikely to be extremely skewed. On average, we expect about 50% boys, so let's assume a slightly higher than average day for both hospitals:

- Hospital 1: 45 babies * 0.55 = 24.75 ≈ 25 boys
- Hospital 2: 15 babies * 0.55 = 8.25 ≈ 8 boys

On days with higher than average boy distribution, Hospital 1 is more likely to have more than 60% boys. However, Hospital 2 would need a very unusual distribution of boys and girls to reach the 60% threshold.

While it's possible that Hospital 2 might have more than 60% boys on some days, it's much less likely compared to Hospital 1. Therefore, I believe that Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
