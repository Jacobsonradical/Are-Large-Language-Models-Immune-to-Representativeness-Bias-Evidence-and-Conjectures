{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We would expect about 60% of days to have more than 60% boys in hospital 1, and about 20% of days to have more than 60% boys in hospital 2. This is based on the assumption that the percentage of boys is equally likely to be above or below 50%, and that it follows a normal distribution.

The number of babies born in each hospital follows a Poisson distribution, which means that the number of days with more than 60% boys will also follow a Poisson distribution. We can calculate the expected number of such days as follows:

For hospital 1, we expect about 0.5 \* 365 = 182.5 days with more than 60% boys. Since we can't have half a day, we'll round this down to 182 days.

For hospital 2, we expect about 0.2 \* 365 = 73 days with more than 60% boys. Again, we'll round this down to 73 days.

Therefore, we would expect hospital 1 to have more days with more than 60% boys than hospital 2. However, the difference is not very large, so it's possible that the actual number of such days could be within 5% of each other. Nonetheless, I would still expect hospital 1 to have more of these days than hospital 2.
