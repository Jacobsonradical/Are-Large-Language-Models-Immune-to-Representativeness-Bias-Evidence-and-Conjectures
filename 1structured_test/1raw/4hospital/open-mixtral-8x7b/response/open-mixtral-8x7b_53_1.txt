{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day. To find out which hospital is more likely to have more than 60% boys on a given day, we can use the binomial probability formula.

For Hospital 1, we want to find the probability of having 27 or more boy babies out of 45 (since 60% of 45 is 27). The probability of a baby being a boy is about 0.5. Using the binomial probability formula:

P(X ≥ 27) = Σ (45! / [(45-X)! * X!]) * (0.5^X) * (0.5^(45-X))

Calculating this probability for X ranging from 27 to 45, we get a total probability of approximately 0.0036 or 0.36% for Hospital 1 having more than 60% boys on a given day.

For Hospital 2, we want to find the probability of having 9 or more boy babies out of 15 (since 60% of 15 is 9). Using the same binomial probability formula, we get:

P(X ≥ 9) = Σ (15! / [(15-X)! * X!]) * (0.5^X) * (0.5^(15-X))

Calculating this probability for X ranging from 9 to 15, we get a total probability of approximately 0.0107 or 1.07% for Hospital 2 having more than 60% boys on a given day.

Comparing the probabilities for both hospitals, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more than 60% boys on a given day. However, to determine whether Hospital 1 or Hospital 2 recorded more such days or if they are about the same (within 5% of each other) would require having the actual data on the number of days each hospital met the condition. But based on the calculated probabilities, Hospital 2 seems more likely to have more days with more than 60% boys.
