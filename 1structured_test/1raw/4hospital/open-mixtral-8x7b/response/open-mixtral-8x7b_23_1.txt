{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for why I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys:

We know that the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is about three times that of Hospital 2 (45 vs 15). This larger sample size in Hospital 1 increases the likelihood of having days with a higher percentage of baby boys, even if the underlying probability remains at 50%.

To estimate the number of days with > 60% baby boys in each hospital, let's assume that the daily percentage of baby boys follows a binomial distribution. We can then approximate this distribution using a normal distribution to calculate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a single day.

For Hospital 1:
P(X >= 27) = P((X - 22.5) / sqrt(22.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5) >= (27 - 22.5) / sqrt(22.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5))
= P(Z >= 0.96) ≈ 0.1675

For Hospital 2:
P(X >= 9) = P((X - 7.5) / sqrt(7.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5) >= (9 - 7.5) / sqrt(7.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5))
= P(Z >= 1.22) ≈ 0.1117

Now, let's calculate the expected number of days with > 60% baby boys in a year (365 days) for each hospital:

Hospital 1: 365 \* 0.1675 ≈ 61 days
Hospital 2: 365 \* 0.1117 ≈ 41 days

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys. The difference between the two hospitals is about 20 days, which is approximately 5% of the total days in a year (365 days). However, considering the larger number of daily births in Hospital 1, I still think Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
