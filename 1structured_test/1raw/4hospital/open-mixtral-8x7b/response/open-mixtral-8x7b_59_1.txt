{hospital: 1}

Here's an explanation for my answer:

We know that Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day. To find out which hospital is more likely to have days with more than 60% baby boys, we can calculate the minimum number of baby boys needed for such days.

For Hospital 1:
- With 45 babies born each day, 60% of them would be 27 baby boys.
- To have more than 60% baby boys, they need at least 28 baby boys.

For Hospital 2:
- With 15 babies born each day, 60% of them would be 9 baby boys.
- To have more than 60% baby boys, they need at least 10 baby boys.

Now let's compare the probability of having at least 28 baby boys in Hospital 1 and at least 10 baby boys in Hospital 2. We'll use the binomial distribution to calculate the probabilities.

For Hospital 1 (45 births, 0.5 probability of being a boy):
P(at least 28 boys) = 1 - P(27 or fewer boys)
                  ≈ 0.0127

For Hospital 2 (15 births, 0.5 probability of being a boy):
P(at least 10 boys) = 1 - P(9 or fewer boys)
                  ≈ 0.0666

So, Hospital 2 has a higher probability of having days with more than 60% baby boys. However, we need to check if the difference is within 5%. To do this, let's find the ratio of the probabilities:

Ratio = P(at least 10 boys in Hospital 2) / P(at least 28 boys in Hospital 1)
     ≈ 0.0666 / 0.0127
     ≈ 5.24

Since the ratio is greater than 5, we can conclude that Hospital 2 has a significantly higher number of days with more than 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 1. Therefore, my answer is Hospital 1 (option 1) for the hospital with fewer such days.
