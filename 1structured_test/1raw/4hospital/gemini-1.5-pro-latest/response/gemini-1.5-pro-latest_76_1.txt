{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. Here's why:

* **Smaller Sample Size, Greater Variation:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 vs 45). With smaller sample sizes, random fluctuations have a more significant impact. It's more likely to see extreme deviations (like 60% or more boys) in the smaller hospital.
* **Larger Sample Size, Closer to Average:** Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to see percentages closer to the average (50% boys) over time.

**In simpler terms:** Imagine flipping a coin 10 times versus 100 times. You're more likely to get a streak of heads (or tails) that significantly skews the overall percentage with the smaller number of flips.
