{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This is a classic example of the **law of large numbers** in statistics. The law of large numbers states that the more times an experiment is repeated, the closer the average of the results will be to the expected value.

* **Hospital 1:** With a larger sample size of 45 babies per day, it's less likely to see extreme deviations from the 50% average.  
* **Hospital 2:**  The smaller sample size of 15 babies makes it more likely to have days with a much higher percentage of boys (e.g., 9 out of 15 babies could be boys, which is already 60%).

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
