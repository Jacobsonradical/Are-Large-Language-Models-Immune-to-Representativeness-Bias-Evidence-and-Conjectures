{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the law of large numbers. Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size, greater variation:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of births per day (15 babies) compared to Hospital 1 (45 babies).  With smaller sample sizes, random fluctuations from the average (50% boys) are more likely.
* **Higher probability of extremes:** It's more probable to get a higher percentage of boys (above 60%) in a smaller sample size. Imagine flipping a coin only 15 times vs. 45 times. You're more likely to get a streak further away from the expected 50/50 split with fewer flips.

Therefore, Hospital 2, with its smaller daily birth count, is more likely to experience days with more than 60% boys.
