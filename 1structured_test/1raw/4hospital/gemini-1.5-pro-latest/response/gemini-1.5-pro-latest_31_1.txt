{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size = greater variation:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of births per day (15 babies) compared to Hospital 1 (45 babies). 
* **Higher probability of extremes:** With a smaller sample size, random fluctuations are more likely to create extreme results.  It's much easier for a few extra baby boys to push the percentage above 60% in Hospital 2 than in Hospital 1.

**Analogy:** Imagine flipping a coin. You're more likely to get a streak of heads if you flip it 10 times compared to flipping it 100 times. 

Therefore, Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
