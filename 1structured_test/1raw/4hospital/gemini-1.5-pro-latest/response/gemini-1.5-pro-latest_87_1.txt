{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the law of large numbers. While both hospitals experience natural fluctuations in the percentage of boys born each day, Hospital 1 (with more births) is more likely to have its daily percentage closer to the average of 50%. 

Hospital 2, with fewer births, is more susceptible to larger swings in the daily percentage.  A few extra boys one day could easily push the percentage over 60%. 

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
