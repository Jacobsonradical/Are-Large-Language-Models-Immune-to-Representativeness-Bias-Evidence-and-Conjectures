{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question relies on understanding the Law of Large Numbers. This law states that the more times you repeat a random event, the closer the average outcome gets to the expected probability.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day). The larger the sample size, the harder it is to deviate significantly from the 50% average for baby boys.
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day). With fewer babies born each day, there's a greater chance of random fluctuations resulting in days with more than 60% boys.

**In short:** Smaller sample sizes are more prone to showing extremes, making it more likely that Hospital 2 recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
