{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This problem is about the **law of large numbers**.  The law of large numbers states that the more times you repeat a random event, the closer the average outcome will be to the expected probability.

* **Hospital 1:** With a larger sample size (45 babies born each day), it's more likely that the percentage of boys born each day will be closer to the expected 50%.
* **Hospital 2:**  The smaller sample size (15 babies) means there's more variability. It's more likely that they will see days with a greater deviation from the 50% average, including days with more than 60% boys. 

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys.
