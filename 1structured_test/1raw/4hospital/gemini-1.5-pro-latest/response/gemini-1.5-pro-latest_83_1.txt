{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This question illustrates the Law of Large Numbers. Here's why:

* **Smaller Sample Size, Greater Variation:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 vs. 45). With smaller samples, there's a greater chance of seeing more extreme deviations from the average (50% boys). 
* **Example:** Imagine flipping a coin 10 times vs. 100 times. You're more likely to get a streak of heads (or tails) that's far from the expected 50% probability when flipping only 10 times.

Since Hospital 2 has a smaller daily number of births, it's more likely to experience days with over 60% boys purely due to random fluctuations.
