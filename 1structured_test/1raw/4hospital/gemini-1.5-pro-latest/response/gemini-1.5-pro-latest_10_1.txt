{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will be to the true average. 

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies born per day). It's more likely that the daily percentage of boys born will be closer to the average of 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day). With fewer births, there's a higher chance of seeing more extreme deviations from the 50% average on any given day.  

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days where over 60% of births are boys.
