{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This problem illustrates the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the observed results will be to the expected probability.

* **Hospital 1 (Larger Sample):** With 45 babies born each day, it's less likely to have extreme fluctuations from the 50% average for boys.
* **Hospital 2 (Smaller Sample):** With only 15 babies born each day, there's a higher chance of seeing days with a significantly higher percentage of boys (over 60%) just by random chance. 

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% boys.
