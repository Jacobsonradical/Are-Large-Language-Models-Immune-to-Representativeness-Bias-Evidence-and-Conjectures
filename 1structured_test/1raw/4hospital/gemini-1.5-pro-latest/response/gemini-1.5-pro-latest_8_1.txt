{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This problem revolves around the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will get to the expected average.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) which means the percentage of boys born each day will be closer to the average of 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day).  With fewer births, there's a greater chance of seeing more significant fluctuations from the average on any given day.  

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days with over 60% boys born because the smaller sample size allows for more variability.
