{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question relates to the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will be to the true average.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) meaning the proportion of baby boys born each day is more likely to be close to the true average of 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day), making it more likely to see larger fluctuations from the average. It's more probable for them to have days with a significantly higher percentage of boys (like 60% or more) just by random chance.
