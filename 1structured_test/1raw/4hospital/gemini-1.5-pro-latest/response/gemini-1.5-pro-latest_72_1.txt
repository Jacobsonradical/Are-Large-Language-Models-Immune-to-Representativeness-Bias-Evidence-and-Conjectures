{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question revolves around the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the observed results will be to the expected probability.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) meaning the proportion of boys born each day is more likely to be close to the expected 50%.

* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day) making it more prone to larger fluctuations. There's a higher chance of having days with more than 60% boys simply because the sample size is smaller. 

**In short:** Smaller samples are more likely to deviate significantly from the average.
