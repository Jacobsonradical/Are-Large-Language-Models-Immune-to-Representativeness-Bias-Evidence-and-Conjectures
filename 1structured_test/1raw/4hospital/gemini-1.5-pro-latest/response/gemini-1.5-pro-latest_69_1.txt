{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question revolves around the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample proportion will be to the true population proportion.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day). The higher number of births makes it less likely to see extreme deviations from the expected 50% boys.
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day). With fewer births, random fluctuations are more likely to result in days with a significantly higher percentage of boys (over 60%).

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
