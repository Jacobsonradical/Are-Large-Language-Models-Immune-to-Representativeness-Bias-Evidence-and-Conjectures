{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This problem highlights the **law of large numbers** in statistics.  The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean gets closer to the expected value (in this case, 50% boys).

* **Hospital 1** with its larger sample size (45 babies) is more likely to have daily birth ratios closer to the expected 50%.  It would be more unusual to see a large deviation from the average with so many births.

* **Hospital 2** with its smaller sample size (15 babies) is more prone to greater fluctuations. While the overall percentage of boys born will still be around 50%, there's a higher chance of seeing extreme days (like more than 60% boys) simply because a few extra boys in a smaller sample make a bigger percentage difference.
