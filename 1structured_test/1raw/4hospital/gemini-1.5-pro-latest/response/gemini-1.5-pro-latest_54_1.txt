{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. In simple terms, the more times we repeat a random event (like a baby being born), the closer the results will get to the average (50% boys).

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day). This means their results are more likely to be closer to the 50% average.  
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day).  With fewer births, there's a greater chance of seeing more significant deviations from the average, including days with more than 60% boys. 

Think of it like flipping a coin. You're more likely to get a closer to 50/50 split between heads and tails if you flip 100 times compared to if you only flip 10 times.
