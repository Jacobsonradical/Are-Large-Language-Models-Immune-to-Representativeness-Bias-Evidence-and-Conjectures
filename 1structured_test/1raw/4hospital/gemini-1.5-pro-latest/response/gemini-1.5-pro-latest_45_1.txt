{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This is a question about the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will be to the true average.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies born per day). This means the percentage of boys born each day is more likely to be close to the true average of 50%.
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies born per day). With a smaller sample size, there's a greater chance for more significant fluctuations. It's more likely to see days with a higher or lower percentage of boys born, even exceeding 60%. 

**In short:** Smaller sample sizes are more prone to variability, making it more likely that Hospital 2 would record more days with over 60% boys born.
