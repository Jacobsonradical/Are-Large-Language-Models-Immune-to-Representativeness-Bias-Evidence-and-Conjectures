{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the law of large numbers.  Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size, greater variation:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 compared to 45). With smaller samples, there's a higher chance of seeing more extreme deviations from the average (50% boys). 
* **More likely to hit the 60% threshold:**  A single boy above the expected number in Hospital 2 has a greater impact on the percentage of boys born that day. For example, 9 boys out of 15 is 60%, but you'd need 27 boys out of 45 to reach 60% in Hospital 1.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days with over 60% boys, even though the overall average should be close to 50% for both hospitals over the year.
