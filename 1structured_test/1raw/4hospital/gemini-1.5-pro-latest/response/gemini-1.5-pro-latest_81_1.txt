{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This problem hinges on the concept of statistical variability.  

* **Smaller samples are more prone to fluctuations.** Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size of 15 babies per day, is more likely to see larger percentage swings. It's easier to get a higher proportion of boys (above 60%) with a smaller sample size.

* **Larger samples tend towards the average.** Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, will have results closer to the 50% average on most days due to the law of large numbers.

**Analogy:** Imagine flipping a coin. You're more likely to get a streak of heads if you flip it only 10 times compared to flipping it 100 times.
