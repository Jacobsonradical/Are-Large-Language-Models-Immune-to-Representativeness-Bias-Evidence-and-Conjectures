{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

* **The Law of Large Numbers:**  The law of large numbers suggests that the more times you repeat a random event (like births), the closer the results will get to the expected average (50% boys). 
* **Smaller Sample Size, Greater Variation:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of births each day. This means the proportion of boys born is more likely to fluctuate significantly away from the 50% average.  Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have daily birth rates closer to 50%.

**In simpler terms:** Imagine flipping a coin. You're more likely to get a streak of heads if you flip it 10 times compared to flipping it 100 times. Hospital 2 is like the coin flipped fewer times â€“ more prone to unusual streaks.
