{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question revolves around the **law of large numbers**.  While both hospitals are subject to the same overall probability of having a boy born (around 50%), the smaller hospital (hospital 2) is more susceptible to larger swings in daily percentages. 

Think of it like flipping a coin:

* **Flipping a few times:** Getting 3 heads in a row is quite likely.
* **Flipping many times:**  Getting 70% heads over 1000 flips is far less likely.

Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, is like flipping the coin fewer times. This makes it more likely they will see days with a higher deviation from the expected 50% split â€“ like having more than 60% boys.
