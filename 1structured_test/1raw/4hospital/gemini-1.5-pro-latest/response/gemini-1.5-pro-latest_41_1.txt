{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This is a classic example of the law of large numbers. While both hospitals experience variation in the daily percentage of baby boys, the smaller hospital (hospital 2) is more susceptible to larger swings in that percentage.

* **Hospital 1** with 45 births per day has a larger sample size, making its daily percentages more likely to hover around the average of 50%.
* **Hospital 2** with only 15 births per day is more likely to have days where a few extra boys can dramatically skew the percentage above 60%. 

Think of it like flipping a coin. You're more likely to get close to a 50/50 split between heads and tails if you flip 100 times compared to flipping only 10 times.
