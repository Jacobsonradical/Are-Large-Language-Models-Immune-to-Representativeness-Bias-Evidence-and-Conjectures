{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This is an example of the Law of Large Numbers.  

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day). The more babies born, the closer the daily percentage of boys is likely to be to the average (50%).
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day). Smaller sample sizes are more prone to larger fluctuations.  It's easier to have a day with a higher percentage of boys (e.g., 60% or more) when you only have 15 births.

**In short, smaller samples are more likely to deviate from the expected average.**
