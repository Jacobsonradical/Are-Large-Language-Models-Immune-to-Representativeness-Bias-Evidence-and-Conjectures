{hospital: 2}

**Reasoning:**

This is a classic example of the law of large numbers in statistics. While the overall probability of having a boy is roughly 50%, smaller sample sizes are more likely to deviate from the average. 

* **Hospital 1** with its larger sample size (45 babies/day) is less likely to have a day where the percentage of boys significantly deviates from 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** with its smaller sample size (15 babies/day) is more likely to experience more days with a greater than 60% proportion of boys.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
