{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This question hinges on the law of large numbers. While the probability of having a boy or girl is roughly the same, smaller sample sizes are more prone to significant variations. 

* **Hospital 1** with 45 births per day has a larger sample size, making it more likely that the percentage of boys born each day will be closer to the average of 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** with only 15 births per day has a smaller sample size. This means the day-to-day variation in the percentage of boys born will be greater. There's a higher chance of having days with significantly more boys (above 60%) in Hospital 2 than in Hospital 1.
