{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This question revolves around the concept of statistical variability and sample size. 

* **Smaller samples are more prone to fluctuations:** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, has a higher chance of seeing more extreme proportions of boys or girls born on any given day.  

Think of it like flipping a coin. If you flip a coin 10 times, you're more likely to get a streak of heads or tails than if you flipped it 100 times.

Hospital 1, with its larger sample size of births, will have daily percentages of boys born closer to the average of 50%.  Hospital 2, on the other hand, will have days where the percentage of boys born deviates further from the average, sometimes exceeding 60%.
