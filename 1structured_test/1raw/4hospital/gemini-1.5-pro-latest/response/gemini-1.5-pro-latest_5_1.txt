{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. While the overall probability of having a boy is about 50%, smaller sample sizes are more likely to deviate from the average. 

* **Hospital 1** with its larger sample size (45 babies per day) is more likely to have daily birth rates closer to the 50% average. 
* **Hospital 2** with its smaller sample size (15 babies per day) has a higher chance of seeing days with more extreme deviations from the average, including days with more than 60% boys. 

Think of it like flipping a coin. You're more likely to get a closer representation of the 50/50 probability by flipping 100 times than you are by flipping only 10 times.
