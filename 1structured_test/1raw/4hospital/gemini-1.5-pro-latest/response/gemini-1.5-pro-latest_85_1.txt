{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This question revolves around the concept of statistical variability.  Smaller sample sizes are more prone to larger fluctuations. 

* **Hospital 1** with its larger sample size of 45 babies per day, is less likely to see extreme deviations from the average of 50% boys. 
* **Hospital 2**, with its smaller sample size of 15 babies per day, has a higher chance of seeing days with a much higher or lower percentage of boys. 

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys.
