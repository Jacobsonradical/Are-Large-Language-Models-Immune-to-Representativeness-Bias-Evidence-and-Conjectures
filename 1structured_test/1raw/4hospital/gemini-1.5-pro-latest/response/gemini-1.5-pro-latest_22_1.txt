{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a matter of the law of large numbers. While both hospitals will see fluctuations in the daily percentage of boys born, the smaller hospital (hospital 2) is more likely to experience days with greater deviation from the 50% average.

Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size:** With fewer births per day, a "streak" of one gender has a more significant impact on the overall percentage. For example, if 10 babies are born, and 7 are boys, that's 70% â€“ a significant deviation.  In a larger hospital with 45 births, you'd need a much longer streak of one gender to see the same percentage shift.
* **Higher variability:** Smaller sample sizes naturally lead to higher variability in proportions. 

Therefore, Hospital 2, with its smaller daily birth count, is more likely to have more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.
