{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This question highlights the Law of Large Numbers in statistics.  While the overall probability of having a boy is about 50%, smaller sample sizes are more likely to have greater variance from the expected average. 

* **Hospital 1** with its larger sample size (45 babies per day) is more likely to have daily birth rates closer to the 50% average. 
* **Hospital 2** with its smaller sample size (15 babies per day) has a higher chance of seeing days with a much higher proportion of boys (like above 60%).

**Think of it like flipping a coin:**

* If you flip a coin 10 times, getting 7 or 8 heads wouldn't be that surprising.
* If you flip a coin 100 times, getting 70 or 80 heads is far less likely.
