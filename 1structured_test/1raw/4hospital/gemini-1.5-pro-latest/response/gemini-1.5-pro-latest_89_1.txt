{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question touches upon the law of large numbers in statistics.  The law of large numbers states that the more times you repeat a random event, the closer the average outcome will be to the expected probability.

* **Hospital 1:** With a larger sample size (45 babies per day), it's less likely to see extreme deviations from the 50% average for baby boys.
* **Hospital 2:**  The smaller sample size (15 babies per day) makes it more likely to have days with a higher percentage of boys due to random fluctuations. 

In simple terms, a small hospital is more likely to have days where, by pure chance, a much higher percentage of babies born are boys.
