{hospital: 2}

**Reasoning:**

This problem illustrates the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample proportion will be to the true population proportion.

* **Hospital 1:** With a larger sample size of 45 babies per day, it's less likely to have extreme fluctuations in the percentage of boys born. 
* **Hospital 2:** With a smaller sample size of 15 babies per day, there's a higher chance of having days with a significantly higher or lower percentage of boys born just due to random chance.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys born because the smaller sample size increases the likelihood of larger deviations from the expected 50%.
