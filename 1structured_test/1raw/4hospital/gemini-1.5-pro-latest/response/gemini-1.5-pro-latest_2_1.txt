{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question highlights the **law of large numbers** in statistics. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the observed results will be to the expected probability. 

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day). It's more likely that their daily percentage of baby boys will be closer to the 50% average. 
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day). With fewer births, there's a greater chance for random fluctuations. A few extra boys in a single day can push the percentage of boys well above 60%. 

Therefore, Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have more days with over 60% baby boys.
