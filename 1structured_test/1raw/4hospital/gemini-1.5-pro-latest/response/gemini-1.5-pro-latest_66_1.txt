{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This question revolves around the **law of large numbers** in statistics. The law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will be to the expected average.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies born per day) compared to **Hospital 2** (15 babies per day). 
* The overall probability of having a boy is relatively stable (around 50%). 

Since Hospital 1 has a larger sample size, it's more likely to have daily boy birth rates closer to the 50% average. Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to experience greater fluctuations in the daily percentage of boys born.  Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days with over 60% boy births.
