{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This question explores a statistical concept known as the **law of large numbers**.  This law states that as the number of trials (births in this case) increases, the observed results will tend to get closer to the expected probability (50% boys).

* **Hospital 1** with its higher birth rate, will have its daily percentages of boys hover closer to 50%.  It's less likely to have extreme fluctuations.
* **Hospital 2** with its smaller sample size (fewer births), is more likely to experience days with greater deviations from the 50% average. This means it's more likely to have days with over 60% boys.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
