{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a question about the **law of large numbers**.  The law of large numbers states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample proportion will be to the true population proportion.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies born each day) than Hospital 2 (15 babies born each day). 
* This means that Hospital 1's daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to be closer to the true population average of 50%. 
* Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to experience greater fluctuations from the average, including more days with over 60% boys.

**In summary:** Smaller samples are more prone to extreme outcomes, even if the underlying probability is consistent.
