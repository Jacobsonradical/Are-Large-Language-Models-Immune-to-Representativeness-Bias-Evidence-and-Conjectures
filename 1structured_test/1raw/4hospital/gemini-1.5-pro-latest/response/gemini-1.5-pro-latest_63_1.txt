{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 vs. 45).  With smaller sample sizes, there is a greater likelihood of seeing more extreme deviations from the average.  

Think of it like flipping a coin.  If you flip a coin 10 times, you're more likely to see a streak of heads or tails than if you flip it 100 times. Hospital 2, with its smaller daily number of births, is more likely to experience days with a higher than 60% proportion of boys purely due to random chance.
