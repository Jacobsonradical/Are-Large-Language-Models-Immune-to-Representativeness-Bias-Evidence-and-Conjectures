{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This question revolves around the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the observed results will be to the expected probability.

* **Hospital 1** with its larger sample size (45 babies per day) is more likely to have boy births hover around the average of 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** with its smaller sample size (15 babies per day) has a higher chance of seeing more significant deviations from the 50% average.  A few extra boys in a single day will have a bigger impact on the daily percentage.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days with over 60% baby boys.
