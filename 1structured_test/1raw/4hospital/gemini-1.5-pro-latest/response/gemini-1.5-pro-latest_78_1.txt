{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This question relies on the concept of statistical variability. Here's why:

* **Smaller Sample Size, Greater Variation:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 vs. 45).  With smaller sample sizes, there's a higher chance of seeing more extreme deviations from the average (50% boys).
* **Illustrative Example:** Imagine flipping a coin 10 times vs. 100 times. You're more likely to get a streak of 7 or 8 heads in a row with 10 flips than with 100 flips. 

While both hospitals might see days with more than 60% boys, Hospital 2 is more likely to have a higher percentage of such days due to the larger fluctuations inherent in its smaller daily birth numbers.
