{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the law of large numbers. The law of large numbers states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample proportion will be to the true population proportion. 

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) so the proportion of boys born each day is more likely to be close to the expected 50%.  
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day). With a smaller sample size, there's a greater chance for more random variation. It's more likely they will see days with a higher deviation from the 50% average, including days with more than 60% boys.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
