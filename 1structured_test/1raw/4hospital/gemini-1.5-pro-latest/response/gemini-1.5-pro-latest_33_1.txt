{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the average of that sample will be to the true average. 

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) so the percentage of boys born each day is more likely to be closer to the expected 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day) meaning there's more variability. It's more likely to have days with a significantly higher or lower percentage of boys born.

Since exceeding 60% boys is a deviation from the expected 50%, it's more likely to happen in the hospital with the smaller sample size.
