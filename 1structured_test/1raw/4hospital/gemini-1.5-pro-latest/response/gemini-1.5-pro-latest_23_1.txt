{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size means more variation:** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, has a smaller sample size. Smaller samples are more prone to fluctuations and outliers. It's much easier for a few extra boys to skew the percentage significantly above 60% in a group of 15 babies than in a group of 45.
* **Larger sample size means more stability:** Hospital 1, with more births per day, has a larger sample size.  Larger samples tend to average out variations, making it more likely they'll stay closer to the expected 50% split between boys and girls.

**Therefore, Hospital 2 (with fewer births per day) is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.**
