{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. Here's why:

* **Hospital 1 (Larger Sample):**  With more births per day, Hospital 1 has a larger sample size. Larger samples tend to average out variations. It's less likely that a large number of births will all deviate significantly from the 50% average for an extended period.

* **Hospital 2 (Smaller Sample):**  Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more susceptible to random fluctuations.  There's a higher chance that a few extra boys (or girls) born in a single day could dramatically skew the daily percentage. 

**In summary:** While both hospitals will see fluctuations, Hospital 2 with fewer births is more likely to see days with over 60% boys more frequently.
