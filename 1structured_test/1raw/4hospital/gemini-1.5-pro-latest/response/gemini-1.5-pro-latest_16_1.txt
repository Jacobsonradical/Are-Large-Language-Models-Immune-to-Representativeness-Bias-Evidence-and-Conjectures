{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question revolves around the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the observed results will be to the expected probability.

* **Hospital 1** with 45 births per day has a larger sample size.  It's more likely to have its daily boy-girl ratio hover around the average of 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** with only 15 births per day has a smaller sample size. This means it's more prone to experiencing greater fluctuations from the average. It's more likely to have days with a significantly higher percentage of boys (over 60%). 

**In short, smaller samples are more likely to show extreme deviations from the average.**
