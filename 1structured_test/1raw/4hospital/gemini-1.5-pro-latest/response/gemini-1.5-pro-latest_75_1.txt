{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. In simpler terms, the more times we repeat a random event (like a baby being born), the closer the results will get to the expected average (50% boys).

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day).  It's more likely they'll see boy births closer to the 50% average on a daily basis.
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day).  With fewer births, there's a greater chance of seeing more significant swings away from the 50% average, including days with more than 60% boys.

**Think of it like flipping a coin:**

* Flipping a coin 10 times, you might easily get 7 heads. 
* Flipping a coin 100 times, it's much less likely you'll get 70 heads. 

Hospital 2 is like flipping the coin fewer times, giving a higher chance of observing unusual results.
