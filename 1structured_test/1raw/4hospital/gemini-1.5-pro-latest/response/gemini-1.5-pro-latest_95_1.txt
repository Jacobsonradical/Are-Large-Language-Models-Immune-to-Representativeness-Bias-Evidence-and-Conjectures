{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers.  The law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample proportion will get to the true population proportion.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day). This means the proportion of boys born each day is more likely to be close to the expected 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day).  With fewer births, there's a higher chance of seeing more extreme variations from the average, including days with more than 60% boys.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys.
