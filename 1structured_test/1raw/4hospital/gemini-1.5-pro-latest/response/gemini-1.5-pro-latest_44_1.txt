{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers.  Here's why:

* **Smaller Sample Size, Greater Variation:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 vs. 45). With smaller sample sizes, there's a higher chance of seeing more extreme deviations from the average (50% boys). 
* **More Likely to Hit the 60% Threshold:**  It's much more probable that a random fluctuation will result in 9 or more baby boys out of 15 (60%) in Hospital 2 than it is to see 27 or more baby boys out of 45 (60%) in Hospital 1.

**In simpler terms:** Imagine flipping a coin 10 times versus flipping it 100 times. You're more likely to get a streak of 7 heads in a row with 10 flips because each flip has a bigger impact on the overall percentage.
