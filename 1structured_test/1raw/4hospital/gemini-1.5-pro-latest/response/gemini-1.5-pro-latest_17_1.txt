{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question revolves around the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will be to the true average. 

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) making it more likely that the percentage of boys born each day will be closer to the average of 50%.
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day).  With fewer births, there's a greater chance of seeing more significant swings away from the 50% average, including more days with over 60% boys. 

**In simple terms:**  Imagine flipping a coin. You're more likely to get closer to a 50/50 split between heads and tails if you flip 100 times compared to flipping only 10 times.
