{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question is about the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will be to the true average. 

* **Hospital 1** with its larger sample size (45 babies per day) is more likely to have daily boy birth rates closer to the 50% average.
* **Hospital 2** with its smaller sample size (15 babies per day) is more likely to see larger fluctuations from the 50% average, including more days above 60%.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% boys.
