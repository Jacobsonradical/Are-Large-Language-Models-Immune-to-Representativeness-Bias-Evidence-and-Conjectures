{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a matter of sample size and statistical probability. 

* **Smaller samples are more prone to larger fluctuations.** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from the average (50%). 
* **Think of extremes:** Imagine if Hospital 2 only had 2 births in a day. There's a 50% chance that both babies will be boys, instantly hitting 100%. Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is far less likely to see such extreme swings in percentage. 

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
