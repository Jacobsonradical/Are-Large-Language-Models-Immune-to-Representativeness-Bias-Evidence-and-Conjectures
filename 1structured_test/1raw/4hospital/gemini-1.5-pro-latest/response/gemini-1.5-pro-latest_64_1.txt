{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This question hinges on the concept of statistical variability and sample size. 

* **Smaller samples are more prone to fluctuations:**  Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, has a higher chance of seeing more extreme proportions of boys born. Imagine flipping a coin 10 times vs. 100 times. You're more likely to get a streak of heads (or tails) that significantly skews the overall percentage with fewer flips.

* **The Law of Large Numbers:** Hospital 1, with more births per day, benefits from the law of large numbers.  This means that over many births, the percentage of boys born will tend to average out closer to the expected 50%.

While there's always a chance for unexpected results, it's statistically more likely that Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size of births, would record more days with over 60% boys.
