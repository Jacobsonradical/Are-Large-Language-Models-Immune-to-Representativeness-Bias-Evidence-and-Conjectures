{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This question hinges on the concept of statistical variability.  Smaller samples are more prone to larger fluctuations. 

* **Hospital 1** with its larger sample size (45 babies/day) is less likely to see extreme deviations from the average (50% boys). 
* **Hospital 2** with its smaller sample size (15 babies/day) is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born deviates significantly from 50%, including going above 60%.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% male births.
