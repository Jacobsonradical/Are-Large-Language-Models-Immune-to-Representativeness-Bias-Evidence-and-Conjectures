{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers.  

* **Hospital 1 (Larger Sample):** With more babies born each day, it's less likely to see a large deviation from the average (50% boys).  The sheer number of births makes it harder for extreme percentages to occur.

* **Hospital 2 (Smaller Sample):** The smaller number of births makes it *more* likely to see larger fluctuations from the average on any given day.  It's more probable to have a day where, just by chance, a higher percentage of the babies born are boys. 

**In short:** Smaller sample sizes are more prone to exhibit greater variability.
