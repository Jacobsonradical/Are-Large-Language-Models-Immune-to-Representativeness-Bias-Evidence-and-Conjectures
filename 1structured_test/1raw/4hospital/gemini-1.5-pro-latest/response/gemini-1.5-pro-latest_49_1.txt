{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This question relies on understanding the **law of large numbers**. In simple terms, the law of large numbers states that the more times you repeat a random event, the closer the average outcome will be to the expected probability.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies born each day). This means their results are more likely to be closer to the 50% average for boys. 
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies born each day).  With fewer births, there's a greater chance of seeing more significant deviations from the 50% average, including days with more than 60% boys.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys.
