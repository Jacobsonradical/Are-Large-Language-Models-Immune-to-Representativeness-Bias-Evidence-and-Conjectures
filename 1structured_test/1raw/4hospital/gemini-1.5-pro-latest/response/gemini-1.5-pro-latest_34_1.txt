{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers.  While both hospitals will see daily fluctuations in the percentage of boys born, Hospital 1 (with more births per day) is more likely to have a percentage close to the average (50%).  

Hospital 2, with fewer births, has a higher chance of seeing more extreme deviations from the average on any given day. This means it's more likely they would record days with more than 60% boys.
