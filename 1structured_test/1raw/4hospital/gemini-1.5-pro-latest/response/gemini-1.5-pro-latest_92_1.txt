{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers in probability. Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size, greater variability:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of births per day (15 babies) compared to Hospital 1 (45 babies). 
* **Higher chance of deviation:** With a smaller sample, random fluctuations in the sex of the babies will have a more significant impact on the daily percentage of boys. Hospital 2 is more likely to see days with greater than 60% boys simply due to chance.
* **Hospital 1 more stable:**  Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, will experience these fluctuations too, but they will be "averaged out" over the larger number of births, keeping the percentage closer to the 50% average.

**In summary:** While both hospitals might occasionally see days with over 60% boys, Hospital 2 is significantly more likely to record more of such days due to its smaller sample size and the increased impact of random variation.
