{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This question hinges on the concept of statistical variability.  Smaller sample sizes are more prone to larger fluctuations. 

* **Hospital 1** with its larger sample size (45 babies/day) will have daily percentages of boys hovering closer to the average of 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** with its smaller sample size (15 babies/day) is more likely to see days with extreme deviations from the 50% average, including days with more than 60% boys. 

Imagine flipping a coin 15 times vs. 45 times. You're more likely to get a streak of heads (or tails) that skews the overall percentage further from 50/50 with the smaller sample size.
