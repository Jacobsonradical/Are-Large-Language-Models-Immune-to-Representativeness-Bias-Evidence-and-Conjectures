{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question hinges on the concept of statistical variability and the law of large numbers. 

* **Smaller Sample Size, Greater Variability:** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, has a smaller sample size. Smaller samples are more prone to fluctuations from the expected average.  

* **Example:** Imagine flipping a coin four times versus flipping it forty times. You're more likely to get a result further from 50/50 (like 75% heads) with only four flips.

Since Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of births each day, it's more likely to see days with a higher deviation from the average 50% â€“ meaning more days with over 60% boys.
