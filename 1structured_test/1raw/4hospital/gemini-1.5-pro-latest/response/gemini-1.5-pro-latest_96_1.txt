{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the law of large numbers in statistics.  Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size, greater variability:** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, will have more day-to-day fluctuation in the percentage of boys born. A few extra boys in a single day can significantly skew the percentage for that day. 
* **Larger sample size, closer to the average:** Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to see the percentage of baby boys hover closer to the 50% average. It's less likely to have extreme swings in the percentage on a daily basis.

**Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.**
