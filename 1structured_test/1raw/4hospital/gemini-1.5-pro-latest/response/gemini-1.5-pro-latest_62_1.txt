{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. Here's why:

* **Smaller Sample Size, Greater Variation:** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, has a smaller sample size. With smaller samples, random fluctuations (like the percentage of boys born) are more pronounced.  It's more likely to see a day with a significantly higher or lower percentage of boys in Hospital 2.
* **Larger Sample Size, More Stability:** Hospital 1, with more births per day, has a larger sample size. Larger samples tend to average out these random fluctuations and stay closer to the expected average (50% boys).

**Therefore, Hospital 2 (with the smaller daily birth rate) is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys born.**
