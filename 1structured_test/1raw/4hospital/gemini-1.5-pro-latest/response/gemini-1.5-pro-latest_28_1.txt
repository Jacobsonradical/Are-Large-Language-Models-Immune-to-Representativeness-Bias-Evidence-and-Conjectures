{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This problem is best understood by considering the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will be to the true average.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) so the daily percentage of boys born will be closer to the true average of 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day) making it more likely to see larger fluctuations from the average.  

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days with more than 60% boys because the smaller sample size allows for more variability.
