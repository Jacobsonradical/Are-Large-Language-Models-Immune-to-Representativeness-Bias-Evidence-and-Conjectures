{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. While both hospitals will see fluctuations in the percentage of boys born each day, the smaller hospital (hospital 2) is more likely to experience days with a higher deviation from the average (50%). 

Think of it like flipping a coin. If you flip a coin 10 times, you might get 7 heads. But if you flip it 1000 times, you're much more likely to get a result closer to 50/50.  

Since hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of births each day, they are more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born is significantly higher than 60%.
