{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the law of large numbers.  While both hospitals might see fluctuations in the percentage of boys born on any given day, the smaller hospital (Hospital 2) is more likely to see larger deviations from the average.

Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of births per day (15 babies) compared to Hospital 1 (45 babies).
* **Increased variability:** With a smaller sample size, random fluctuations in the sex of babies born will have a more significant impact on the daily percentage. 
* **Higher chance of extremes:** It's simply more likely to get a streak of more boys (or more girls) in a row with a smaller sample size, pushing the percentage further from the 50% average.

While we expect both hospitals to average around 50% boys over a long period, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days that deviate significantly from that average, including days with more than 60% boys.
