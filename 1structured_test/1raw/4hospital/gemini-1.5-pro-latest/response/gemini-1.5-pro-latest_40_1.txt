{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. While the overall probability of having a boy is about 50%, smaller sample sizes are more likely to have greater variance from the average. 

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) making it more likely that the percentage of boys born each day will be closer to the 50% average.

* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day) making it more susceptible to larger fluctuations. It's more likely for them to have days with a significantly higher or lower percentage of boys.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days with over 60% boys, even though the overall average is close to 50%.
