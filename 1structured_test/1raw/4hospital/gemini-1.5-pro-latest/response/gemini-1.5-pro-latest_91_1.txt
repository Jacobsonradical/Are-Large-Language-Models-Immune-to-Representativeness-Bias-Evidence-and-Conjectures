{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question hinges on the concept of statistical variability. 

* **Smaller samples are more prone to extreme fluctuations.**  Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, is more likely to see days with a significantly higher than 50% proportion of boys. 

Think of it like flipping a coin:

* If you flip a coin 10 times, getting 7 or 8 heads (70-80%) isn't that unusual.
* If you flip a coin 100 times, getting 70 or 80 heads is much less likely. 

Hospital 1, with its larger sample size of births, will have its daily boy/girl ratio hover closer to 50% more consistently.
