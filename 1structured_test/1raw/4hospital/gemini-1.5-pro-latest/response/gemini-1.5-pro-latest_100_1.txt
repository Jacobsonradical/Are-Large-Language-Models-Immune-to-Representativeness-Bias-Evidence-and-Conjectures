{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the law of large numbers.  While both hospitals will see variation in the percentage of boys born each day, the smaller hospital (hospital 2) is more likely to see more extreme deviations from the 50% average. 

Think of it this way:

* **Hospital 1 (Large Sample):** With 45 births a day, a swing of just a few babies more or fewer boys won't drastically change the overall percentage. 
* **Hospital 2 (Small Sample):** With only 15 births a day, a swing of the same number of babies will have a much bigger impact on the daily percentage.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days with greater than 60% boys even though the overall average should be close to 50% for both over time.
