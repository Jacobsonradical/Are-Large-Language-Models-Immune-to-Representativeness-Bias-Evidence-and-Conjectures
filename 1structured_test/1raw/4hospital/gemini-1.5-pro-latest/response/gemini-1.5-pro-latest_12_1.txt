{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question revolves around the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the observed results will be to the expected probability.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day). It's more likely to have daily birth ratios closer to the 50% average.
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day). With fewer births, there's a higher chance of seeing more significant deviations from the 50% average, including more days with over 60% boys.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys.
