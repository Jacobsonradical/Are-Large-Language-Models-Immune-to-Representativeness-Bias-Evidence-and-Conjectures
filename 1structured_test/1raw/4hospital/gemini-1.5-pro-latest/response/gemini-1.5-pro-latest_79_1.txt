{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers in statistics.  Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size, greater variation:** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, is more likely to experience larger percentage swings.  Imagine if only 3 babies were born â€“ a single extra boy would mean 66% were boys! In a larger sample size (like Hospital 1's 45 births), the percentages tend to even out closer to the average (50%) due to the higher number of events. 

* **More opportunities for outliers:**  Hospital 2 simply has more chances for a day to be skewed heavily towards boys.  

While both hospitals will have days with more than 60% boys, Hospital 2 is statistically more likely to have a significantly higher number of those days over the year.
