{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the law of large numbers in statistics.  Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size, greater variability:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 vs. 45). With smaller sample sizes, random fluctuations are more likely to result in extreme percentages. 
* **Higher chance of exceeding 60%:**  It's easier for a few extra boys to push the percentage above 60% in a smaller group. For example, if just 2-3 extra boys are born in hospital 2, it can significantly impact the daily percentage. In hospital 1, you'd need many more extra boys to have the same effect.

**Therefore, Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have more days with over 60% baby boys.**
