{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a matter of the Law of Large Numbers. While both hospitals will see fluctuations in the percentage of boys born each day, Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size of births, is more likely to experience larger swings in those percentages. 

* **Hospital 1** with more births per day, is more likely to have the percentage of boys born hover closer to the 50% average. 
* **Hospital 2**, with fewer births, has a higher chance of a few extra boys (or fewer boys) significantly skewing the daily percentage.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys.
