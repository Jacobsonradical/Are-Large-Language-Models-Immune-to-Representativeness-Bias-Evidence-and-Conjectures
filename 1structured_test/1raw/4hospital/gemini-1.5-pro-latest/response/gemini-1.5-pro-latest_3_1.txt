{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will be to the true population average.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies born per day). The higher the number of births, the less likely it is to have significant deviations from the 50% average for boys.
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies born per day). With fewer births, there's a greater chance of having days with more significant fluctuations in the percentage of boys born. 

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys due to its smaller sample size and the increased probability of statistical fluctuations.
