{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the law of large numbers.  

* **Smaller sample size, greater variation:** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, is more likely to see larger swings in the percentage of boys born. A few extra boys in a day can easily push the percentage over 60%.  

* **Larger sample size, closer to average:** Hospital 1, with more births, is more likely to have the percentage of boys born hover closer to the 50% average.  

**Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys born.**
