{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size, greater variation:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 compared to 45). With smaller sample sizes, there's a higher chance of seeing more extreme deviations from the average (50% boys). 
* **More likely to hit the threshold:**  It's more likely for a few extra boys to push the percentage above 60% in Hospital 2 than in Hospital 1, simply because there are fewer babies born overall.

Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have its daily birth rates hover closer to the 50% average.
