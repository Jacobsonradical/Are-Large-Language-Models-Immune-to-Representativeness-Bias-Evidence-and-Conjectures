{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers.  Here's why:

* **Smaller Sample Size = More Variability:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 vs. 45). With smaller samples, there's a greater chance of seeing extreme deviations from the average (50% boys). 
* **Larger Sample Size = Closer to Average:** Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have daily birth rates closer to the 50% average for boys.

**In simpler terms:** It's much easier to get a higher percentage of boys (over 60%) when you're only dealing with 15 births compared to 45 births.
