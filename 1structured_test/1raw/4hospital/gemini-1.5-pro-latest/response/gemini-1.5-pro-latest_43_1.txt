{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size, greater variability:** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, has a smaller sample size.  With smaller samples, random fluctuations (like the percentage of boys born) are more pronounced. 
* **Hospital 1, closer to the average:** Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have a percentage of boys born closer to the 50% average on any given day.

**Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to see days with greater than 60% boys born due to the higher variability inherent in smaller sample sizes.**
