{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers in probability. While it's true that the overall probability of having a boy is about 50%, smaller sample sizes are more likely to deviate from the average. 

* **Hospital 1** with its larger sample size (45 babies per day) will have daily birth ratios closer to the 50% average. 
* **Hospital 2** with its smaller sample size (15 babies per day) is more likely to see days with extreme fluctuations, including days with more than 60% boys.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
