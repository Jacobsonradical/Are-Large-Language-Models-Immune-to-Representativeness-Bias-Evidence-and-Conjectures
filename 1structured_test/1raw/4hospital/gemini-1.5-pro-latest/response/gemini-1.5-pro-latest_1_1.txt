{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question revolves around the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the average of that sample will be to the true average.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies born per day).  The larger the sample, the harder it becomes to deviate significantly from the 50% average.
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies born per day). With fewer births, there's a higher chance of seeing more significant swings away from the 50% average, including days with more than 60% boys.

**In simpler terms:** Imagine flipping a coin. You're more likely to get a streak of heads if you only flip it a few times compared to flipping it many times.
