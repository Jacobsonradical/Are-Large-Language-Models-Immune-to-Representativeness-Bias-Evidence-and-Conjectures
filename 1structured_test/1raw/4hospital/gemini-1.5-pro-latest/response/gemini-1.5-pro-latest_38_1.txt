{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the average of that sample will be to the true average. 

* **Hospital 1** with 45 births per day has a larger sample size. It's more likely that the daily percentage of baby boys will be closer to the 50% average.
* **Hospital 2** with only 15 births per day has a smaller sample size. This means there's a greater chance for more significant daily fluctuations from the 50% average, including more days with over 60% boys. 

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys.
