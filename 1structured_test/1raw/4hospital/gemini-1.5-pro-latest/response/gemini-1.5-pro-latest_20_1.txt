{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This problem revolves around the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will be to the true average.

* **Hospital 1** with 45 births per day has a larger sample size. This means the percentage of boys born each day is more likely to be close to the expected average of 50%.  
* **Hospital 2** with only 15 births per day has a smaller sample size. With fewer births, the percentage of boys born on a given day is more likely to fluctuate further from the 50% average.  

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to see days with more than 60% boys born simply because its smaller sample size allows for more extreme variations.
