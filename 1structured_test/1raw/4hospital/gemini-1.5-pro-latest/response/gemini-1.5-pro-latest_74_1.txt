{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers in statistics. 

* **Smaller sample sizes lead to greater variability.** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, has a higher chance of seeing more extreme deviations from the average (50% boys). 
* **Larger sample sizes tend towards the average.** Hospital 1, with more births per day, is more likely to have its daily birth ratios hover closer to the 50% average.

Since Hospital 2 is more likely to see larger swings in the percentage of boys born each day, it's more likely they would record more days with over 60% baby boys, even though the overall average should be close to 50%.
