{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This question hinges on the concept of statistical variability and sample size. Here's why:

* **Smaller samples are more prone to fluctuations:** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, has a higher chance of seeing more extreme percentages of boys or girls.  Imagine flipping a coin 10 times vs. 100 times. You're more likely to get a streak of heads (or tails) that significantly skews the overall percentage with the smaller sample size.

* **The law of averages:** Over a long period (a year), both hospitals should see roughly 50% boys. However, the day-to-day variation is more pronounced in the hospital with fewer births.

**Therefore, Hospital 2 (with fewer births per day) is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.**
