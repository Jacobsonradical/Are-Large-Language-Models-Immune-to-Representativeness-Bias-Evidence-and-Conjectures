{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size, greater variation:** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, is more likely to have days with a higher percentage of boys that deviate significantly from the 50% average. 
* **Larger sample size, closer to average:** Hospital 1, with more births per day, will experience fluctuations in the percentage of boys born, but these fluctuations are more likely to stay closer to the 50% average due to the larger sample size.

**In simpler terms:** Imagine flipping a coin 10 times vs. flipping it 100 times. You're more likely to get a streak of heads (or tails) that's far from the 50% average with fewer flips.
