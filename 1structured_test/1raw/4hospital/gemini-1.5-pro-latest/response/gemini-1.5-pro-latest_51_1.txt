{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question revolves around the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will be to the true population average. 

* **Hospital 1** with its larger sample size (45 babies per day) is more likely to have a boy birth rate close to the average of 50%. Days with over 60% boys will be less frequent.

* **Hospital 2** with its smaller sample size (15 babies per day) is more prone to larger fluctuations.  It's more likely to see days with significantly more or fewer boys than the average, including days with over 60% boys.
