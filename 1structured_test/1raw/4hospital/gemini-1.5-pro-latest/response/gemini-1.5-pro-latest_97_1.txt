{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question revolves around the **law of large numbers** in statistics. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the observed results will be to the expected probability.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) which means the proportion of boys born each day is more likely to be close to the expected 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day), making it more prone to greater fluctuations.  It's more likely to see days with a significantly higher or lower percentage of boys born.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys born.
