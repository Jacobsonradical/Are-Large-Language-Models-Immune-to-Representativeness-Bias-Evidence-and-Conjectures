{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size, greater variability:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 vs. 45).  With smaller samples, there's a higher chance of seeing extreme deviations from the average (like having a day with more than 60% boys). 
* **Larger sample size, closer to average:** Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have the percentage of boys born each day stay closer to the 50% average.

**In simpler terms:** Imagine flipping a coin 10 times versus flipping it 100 times. You're more likely to get a streak of heads (or tails) with fewer flips because each flip has a bigger impact on the overall percentage.
