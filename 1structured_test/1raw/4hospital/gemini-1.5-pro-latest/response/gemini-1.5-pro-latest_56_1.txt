{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers in statistics.  

* **Hospital 1** (with more births per day) will see a proportion of boys closer to the average (50%) more often. This is because each day's births act like a larger sample size, and larger samples tend to even out variations.
* **Hospital 2** (with fewer births per day) has a higher chance of seeing more extreme deviations from the average on any given day.  Their smaller sample size allows for more day-to-day fluctuation.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days with over 60% baby boys, even though the overall average will hover around 50% for both hospitals over the year.
