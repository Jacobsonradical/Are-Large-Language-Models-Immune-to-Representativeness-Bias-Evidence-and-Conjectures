{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the law of large numbers in probability. The law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will be to the expected average. 

* **Hospital 1** with 45 births per day has a larger sample size. The percentage of boys born each day is more likely to be close to the expected average of 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** with only 15 births per day has a smaller sample size.  Random fluctuations are more likely to produce days with a significantly higher or lower percentage of boys.

**Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days with over 60% boys because the smaller sample size allows for greater variation from the average.**
