{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will be to the true population average. 

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) which means the daily percentage of boys born is more likely to be close to the average of 50%. 
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day) which means there is more variability. It's more likely to see days with a significantly higher or lower percentage of boys born, just by random chance. 

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys born.
