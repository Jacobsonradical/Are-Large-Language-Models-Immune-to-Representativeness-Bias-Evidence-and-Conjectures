{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question explores the concept of the **law of large numbers**. This law states that as the number of trials in a random process increases, the results will tend to approach the expected average.

* **Hospital 1:** With a larger sample size (45 babies per day), it's more likely that the daily percentage of boys will be closer to the 50% average.  It will be less likely for random fluctuations to push the percentage of boys above 60% on any given day.

* **Hospital 2:** With a smaller sample size (15 babies per day), there's a greater chance for more significant daily variations. It's more likely for random fluctuations to result in days with more than 60% boys, even though the overall average is still around 50%. 

**In simple terms, the smaller hospital is more likely to see extreme deviations from the average due to the smaller sample size.**
