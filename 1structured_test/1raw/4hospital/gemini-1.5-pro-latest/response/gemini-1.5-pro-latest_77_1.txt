{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the law of large numbers.  Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 vs. 45). 
* **Higher variability:** With smaller samples, there's a greater chance of seeing extreme fluctuations from the average (50% boys). It's more likely that a random fluctuation will result in 60% or more boys in a smaller group.
* **Long-term average:** Over a year, both hospitals will likely average close to 50% baby boys. However, Hospital 2 will have more days with extreme deviations from this average. 

**Analogy:** Imagine flipping a coin 10 times vs. 100 times. You're more likely to get a streak of 70% or more heads with the smaller sample size (10 flips) just due to random chance.
