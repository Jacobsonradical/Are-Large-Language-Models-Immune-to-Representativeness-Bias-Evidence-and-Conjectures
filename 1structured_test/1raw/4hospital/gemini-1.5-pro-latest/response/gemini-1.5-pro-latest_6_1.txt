{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. Here's how it applies:

* **Smaller Sample Size, Greater Variation:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 vs. 45). With smaller sample sizes, there's a higher chance of seeing extreme deviations from the average (like having a day with more than 60% boys). 
* **Larger Sample Size, Closer to Average:** Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is more likely to have the percentage of boys born each day stay closer to the average of 50%. 

**In short:**  Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days with a higher deviation from the average, including days with more than 60% boys.
