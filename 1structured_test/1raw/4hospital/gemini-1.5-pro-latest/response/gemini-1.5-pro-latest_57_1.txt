{hospital: 2} 

Here's why:

This question revolves around the **law of large numbers**. This law states that the larger the sample size, the closer the sample average will be to the true average.

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies per day). The higher the number of births, the more difficult it will be for the percentage of boys to deviate significantly from the expected 50%.
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day). With fewer births, there's a greater chance for random fluctuations to result in a day with more than 60% boys. 

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
