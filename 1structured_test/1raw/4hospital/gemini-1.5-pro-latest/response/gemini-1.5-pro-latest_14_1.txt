{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. Here's why:

* **Smaller Sample Size, Greater Variation:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 compared to 45). With smaller samples, there's a higher chance of seeing extreme deviations from the average (50% boys). 
* **More Likely to Hit the Threshold:** A single baby's sex has a bigger impact on the daily percentage in Hospital 2. For example, if 9 babies are boys in Hospital 2, that's already 60%. In Hospital 1, they would need 27 boys to hit 60%.

While both hospitals will have fluctuations, Hospital 2 is more likely to see days with more than 60% boys simply because any deviation from the average has a larger impact on their smaller sample size.
