{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This question illustrates the **law of large numbers**. In simpler terms, the more times you flip a coin, the closer the results will be to a 50/50 split between heads and tails. 

* **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies born per day). The higher the sample size, the less likely it is to have extreme deviations from the average (50% boys).
* **Hospital 2** has a smaller sample size (15 babies born per day). With fewer births, there's a greater chance of having a day where the percentage of boys is significantly higher or lower than 50%.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days with over 60% baby boys because random fluctuations have a greater impact on smaller samples.
