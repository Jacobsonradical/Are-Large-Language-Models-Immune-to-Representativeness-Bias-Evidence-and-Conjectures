{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size, greater variability:** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, has a higher chance of experiencing more extreme deviations from the average (50% boys). 
* **Imagine extreme scenarios:**  Think about it â€“ if only one baby is born, there's a 100% chance it's either a boy or a girl. But as the number of births increases, the percentages tend to even out closer to the expected average. 

While both hospitals might have days with over 60% boys, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded a greater number of such days over the year.
