{hospital: 2}

**Explanation:**

This question highlights the concept of sample size and variability. 

* **Smaller samples have higher variability:** Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, is more likely to see larger swings in the percentage of boys born. Imagine flipping a coin 10 times vs. 100 times. You're more likely to get a streak of heads further away from the expected 50% with fewer flips. 

* **Larger samples tend towards the average:** Hospital 1, with more births per day, will have its daily percentages of boys closer to the average of 50%.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days with greater than 60% boys born simply because its smaller daily birth numbers are more susceptible to larger fluctuations.
