{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic example of the Law of Large Numbers. Here's why:

* **Smaller sample size = greater variability:** Hospital 2 has a much smaller sample size of births per day (15 babies) compared to Hospital 1 (45 babies). 
* **Higher likelihood of deviation:** With a smaller sample size, random fluctuations (like the percentage of boys born) are more likely to result in extreme outcomes.  It's much easier to get a higher percentage of boys  (above 60%) when you only have 15 births compared to 45.

**In simpler terms:** Imagine flipping a coin 10 times vs. 100 times. You're more likely to see a streak of heads (or tails) with fewer flips. Hospital 2 is like flipping the coin fewer times, making it more likely to have days with a higher than 60% chance of baby boys.
