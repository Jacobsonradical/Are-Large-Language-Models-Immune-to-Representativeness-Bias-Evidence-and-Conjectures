{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This problem revolves around the **law of large numbers**.  This law states that the more times an experiment is repeated, the closer the average of the results will be to the expected value.

* **Hospital 1** with its larger sample size (45 babies per day) is more likely to have its daily birth ratios hover around the expected 50% boys.  

* **Hospital 2** with its smaller sample size (15 babies per day) is more likely to experience greater fluctuations from the expected 50%.  A few extra boys one day can easily skew the percentage above 60%.

**In short, smaller samples are more susceptible to random variations.**
