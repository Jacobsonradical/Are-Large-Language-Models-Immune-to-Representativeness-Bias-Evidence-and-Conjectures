{hospital: 2}

Here's why:

This question illustrates the **law of large numbers**. While both hospitals will see variation in the daily percentage of boys born, the smaller hospital (hospital 2) is more likely to experience days with greater deviations from the average. 

Think of it this way: If you flip a coin only 10 times, getting 8 heads (80%) is not that surprising. But if you flip a coin 100 times, getting 80 heads is much less likely.  

Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, is like flipping the coin fewer times. There's a higher chance they'll see days with a significantly higher percentage of boys born just due to random fluctuations.
