{hospital: 2} 

**Explanation:**

Hospital 2 is smaller and has a lower sample size of births each day. With smaller sample sizes, there's a greater chance for more significant deviations from the average.  

* **Larger Sample Size (Hospital 1):**  With 45 babies born per day, random fluctuations in gender are more likely to average out, staying closer to the 50% average. 
* **Smaller Sample Size (Hospital 2):** With only 15 babies, a few extra boys born in a day can easily push the percentage of boys well above 60%. 

**Analogy:** Imagine flipping a coin. You're more likely to get a 50/50 split between heads and tails after flipping 100 times compared to flipping only 10 times.
