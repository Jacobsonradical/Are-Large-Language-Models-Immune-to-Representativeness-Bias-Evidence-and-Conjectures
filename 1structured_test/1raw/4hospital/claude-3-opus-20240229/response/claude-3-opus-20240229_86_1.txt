To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys, we need to consider the law of large numbers and the concept of variance.

The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean tends to approach the expected value (in this case, 50% boys). This means that the larger hospital (hospital 1) is more likely to have daily percentages of baby boys closer to the expected 50%.

On the other hand, the smaller hospital (hospital 2) will have more variance in its daily percentages due to the smaller sample size. This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have extreme values, such as days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys compared to hospital 1.
