To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a larger sample size (more births per day), the percentage of baby boys born each day is likely to be closer to the average of 50%. With a smaller sample size, there's more room for the daily percentage to deviate from the average.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies per day, while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies per day. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the average, exceeding 60%.

Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, will likely have a more stable daily percentage, hovering closer to the 50% average.

So, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born due to its smaller sample size and higher variability in daily percentages.
