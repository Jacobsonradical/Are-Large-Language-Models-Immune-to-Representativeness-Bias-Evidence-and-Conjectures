To answer this question, we need to consider the concept of variability in small sample sizes versus large sample sizes.

In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, which is a relatively large sample size. With a larger sample size, the percentage of baby boys born each day is likely to be closer to the expected 50%. There will be less day-to-day variability in the percentage.

In hospital 2, only about 15 babies are born each day, which is a smaller sample size. With a smaller sample size, there is likely to be more day-to-day variability in the percentage of baby boys born. Some days might have a much higher or lower percentage than the expected 50%.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller daily birth rate, is more likely to have a higher number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, due to the higher variability in the daily percentages.
