To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a smaller sample size (fewer babies born each day), there is more likely to be greater fluctuation in the daily percentage of baby boys. Conversely, a larger sample size will tend to have less extreme variations from the average.

Given:
- Hospital 1: about 45 babies born each day
- Hospital 2: about 15 babies born each day

Since Hospital 2 has a much smaller number of daily births compared to Hospital 1, it is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 2}
