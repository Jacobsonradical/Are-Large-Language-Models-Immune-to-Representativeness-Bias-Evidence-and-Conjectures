To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a smaller sample size (fewer babies born each day), there is more likely to be random fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys born on any given day. Hospital 2, with only about 15 babies born each day, will have more variability in the daily percentage of baby boys compared to Hospital 1, which has a larger sample size of about 45 babies per day.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeded 60%, due to the higher variability in the smaller sample size.
