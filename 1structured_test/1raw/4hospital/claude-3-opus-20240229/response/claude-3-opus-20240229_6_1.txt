To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the law of large numbers and the variability in smaller sample sizes.

With a larger sample size (more births per day), the percentage of baby boys born each day is likely to be closer to the average of 50%. Hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, has a larger sample size compared to Hospital 2, which has only about 15 babies born each day.

In Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, the percentage of baby boys born each day is more likely to deviate from the average due to higher variability. This means that Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys is significantly higher (or lower) than 50%.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
