To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys, we need to consider the role of sample size in the variability of proportions.

With a larger sample size (more births per day), the percentage of boys born each day is likely to be closer to the expected average of 50%. With a smaller sample size, there is more room for the daily percentage to deviate from the average.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 births per day, while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 births per day. Due to its smaller sample size, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born deviates significantly from the average of 50%, exceeding the 60% threshold.

Therefore, Hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys compared to Hospital 1.
