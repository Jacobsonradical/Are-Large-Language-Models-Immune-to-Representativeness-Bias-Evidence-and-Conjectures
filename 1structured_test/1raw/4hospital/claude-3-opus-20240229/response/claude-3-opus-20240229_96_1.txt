To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), there is more variability in the daily percentage of baby boys. This means there will be more days where the percentage deviates significantly from the average of 50%.

On the other hand, hospital 1 has a larger sample size (about 45 babies per day), so the daily percentage of baby boys will be closer to the average of 50% on most days.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller sample size and higher variability, is more likely to have recorded more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeded 60%.
