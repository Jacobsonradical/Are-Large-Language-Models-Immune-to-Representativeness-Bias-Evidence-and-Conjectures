To answer this question, we need to consider the concept of statistical fluctuations. In a smaller sample size, like the 15 babies born each day in hospital 2, the percentage of boys born can vary more dramatically from day to day compared to a larger sample size, like the 45 babies born each day in hospital 1.

With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of boys born will be closer to the expected average of 50%. However, with a smaller sample size, there is a higher chance of observing days where the percentage of boys born deviates significantly from the expected average.

Therefore, hospital 2, which has a smaller number of babies born each day, is more likely to have a higher number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.
