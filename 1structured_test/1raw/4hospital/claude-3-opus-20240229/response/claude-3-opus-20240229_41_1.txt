To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boys born, we need to consider the probability of such an event occurring in each hospital.

The key factor here is the sample size. Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). In general, larger sample sizes tend to have proportions closer to the expected average, while smaller sample sizes are more prone to deviations due to random chance.

Given that the average percentage of baby boys is around 50%, Hospital 2, with its smaller daily birth count, is more likely to have days that deviate significantly from this average. Hospital 1, with a larger daily birth count, will tend to have daily percentages closer to the 50% average.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeded 60%.
