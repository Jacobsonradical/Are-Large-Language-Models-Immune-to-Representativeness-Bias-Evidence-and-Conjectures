To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

The smaller sample size (fewer babies born each day) in hospital 2 will lead to more variability in the daily percentage of baby boys. With a larger sample size, hospital 1 will have percentages closer to the mean of 50% on most days.

Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have extreme percentages (like more than 60% boys) on any given day, even though both hospitals will have an average of about 50% boys over a longer period.

So, hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born compared to hospital 1.
