To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, while in hospital 2, only about 15 babies are born each day. The smaller sample size in hospital 2 means that the percentage of baby boys born each day is more likely to deviate from the average of 50% due to random chance.

In other words, the proportion of baby boys in hospital 2 is more likely to fluctuate above or below 60% on any given day compared to hospital 1, where the larger sample size tends to keep the daily proportion closer to the average.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller daily number of births, likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born compared to hospital 1.
