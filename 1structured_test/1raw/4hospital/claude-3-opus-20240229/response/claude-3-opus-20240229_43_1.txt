To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

The key concept is that smaller sample sizes (fewer babies born per day) lead to higher variability in the percentage. With a larger sample size, the percentage will be closer to the expected average of 50%.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies born each day, so the percentage of baby boys will likely be closer to 50% on most days. There will be less variability.

Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies born each day. This smaller sample size means the percentage of baby boys will be more variable from day to day. On some days it may be much higher than 50%, and on other days much lower.

Therefore, Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size and higher variability, likely recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
