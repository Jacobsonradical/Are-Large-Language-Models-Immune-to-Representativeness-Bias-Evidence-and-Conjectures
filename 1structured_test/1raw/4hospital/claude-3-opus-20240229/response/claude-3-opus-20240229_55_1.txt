To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a larger sample size (more births per day), the percentage of boys born each day is likely to be closer to the average of 50%. With a smaller sample size, there's more room for the daily percentage to deviate from the average.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 births per day, so the percentage of boys born each day is likely to be closer to 50%. It's less likely to have days where the percentage significantly deviates from 50%, such as above 60%.

Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 births per day. With this smaller sample, the daily percentage of boys is more likely to deviate significantly from the average of 50%. Thus, it's more likely to have days where the percentage is above 60%.

Therefore, hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% of the babies born being boys.
