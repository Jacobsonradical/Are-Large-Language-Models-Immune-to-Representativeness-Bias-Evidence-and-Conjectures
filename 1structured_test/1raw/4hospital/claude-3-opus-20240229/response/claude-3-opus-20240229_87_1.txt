To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boy births, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

With a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), there is more likelihood of the percentage deviating significantly from the expected 50% on any given day. Conversely, a larger sample size (hospital 1 with about 45 babies per day) tends to have proportions closer to the expected value.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller daily birth count, is more likely to have a higher number of days where the proportion of boys born exceeded 60%.
