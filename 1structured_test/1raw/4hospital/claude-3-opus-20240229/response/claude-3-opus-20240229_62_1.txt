To determine which hospital is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys, we need to consider the variability in the daily percentage of boy births.

The smaller the sample size (i.e., the number of babies born each day), the more likely it is to deviate significantly from the average of 50% on any given day. Conversely, a larger sample size tends to have less extreme fluctuations and is more likely to be closer to the average.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies born each day. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boy births deviates significantly from the average, potentially exceeding the 60% threshold.

In conclusion, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys due to its smaller sample size and higher variability in daily percentages.
