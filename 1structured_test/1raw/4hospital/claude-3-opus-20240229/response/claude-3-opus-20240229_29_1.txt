To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a larger sample size (more babies born each day), the percentage of baby boys born will tend to be closer to the expected average of 50%. With a smaller sample size, there is more room for the daily percentage to fluctuate.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies per day, so the daily percentage of baby boys is less likely to deviate far from 50%.

Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies per day, so the daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to fluctuate further from 50%, resulting in more days where the percentage exceeds 60%.

Therefore, hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born due to its smaller sample size and greater variability in the daily percentages.
