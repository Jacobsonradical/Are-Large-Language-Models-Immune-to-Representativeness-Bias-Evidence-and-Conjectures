To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

With a smaller sample size (fewer births per day), the percentage of baby boys born each day is more likely to deviate significantly from the average of 50%. In contrast, a larger sample size (more births per day) tends to result in daily percentages closer to the average.

Given:
- Hospital 1: about 45 babies born each day
- Hospital 2: about 15 babies born each day

Since Hospital 2 has a much smaller number of daily births compared to Hospital 1, it is more likely to have extreme daily variations in the percentage of baby boys born. This means Hospital 2 is more likely to have a higher number of days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 2}
