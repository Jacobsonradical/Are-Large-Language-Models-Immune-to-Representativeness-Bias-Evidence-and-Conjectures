To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boy births, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a larger sample size (more births per day), the percentage of boys born each day is likely to be closer to the average of 50%. With a smaller sample size, there is more variability in the daily percentage.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 births per day, so the percentage of boys born each day will likely be closer to 50%. Deviations above 60% will be less common.

Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 births per day. With fewer births, there is more room for the daily percentage to fluctuate. It's more likely to have days where the percentage of boys is significantly higher (or lower) than 50%.

Therefore, due to the smaller sample size and higher variability, Hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% boy births compared to Hospital 1.
