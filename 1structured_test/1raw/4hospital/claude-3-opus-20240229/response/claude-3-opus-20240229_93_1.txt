To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a larger sample size (more births per day), the percentage of boys born each day is likely to be closer to the expected average of 50%. With a smaller sample size, there's more room for the daily percentage to fluctuate further from 50%.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 births per day, so the daily percentage of boys is more likely to be close to 50%. It's less likely to have days where the percentage significantly exceeds 60%.

Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 births per day. This smaller sample size allows for more variability in the daily percentage of boys. It's more likely to have days that significantly deviate from the expected 50%, exceeding 60%.

Therefore, due to its smaller sample size and greater variability, Hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% boys born.
