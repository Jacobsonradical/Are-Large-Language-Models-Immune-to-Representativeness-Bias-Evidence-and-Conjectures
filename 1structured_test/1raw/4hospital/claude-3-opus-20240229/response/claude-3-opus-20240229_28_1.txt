To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

In a smaller sample (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), there is more variability in the daily proportion of baby boys due to random chance. In a larger sample (hospital 1 with about 45 babies per day), the daily proportions will be closer to the expected average of 50%.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have extreme proportions (like more than 60% boys) on any given day, simply due to random variability.

Over the course of a year, hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born compared to hospital 1.
