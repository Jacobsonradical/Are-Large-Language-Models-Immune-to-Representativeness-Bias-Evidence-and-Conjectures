To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

With a larger sample size (more babies born each day), the percentage of baby boys will tend to be closer to the average of 50%. With a smaller sample size, there is more variability and thus a higher chance of having days where the percentage deviates significantly from 50%.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies born each day, so the percentage of baby boys will likely be closer to 50% on most days. Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies born each day, so there will be more variability in the daily percentage of baby boys.

Therefore, Hospital 2, with the smaller sample size, is more likely to have a higher number of days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
