To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the law of large numbers and the concept of variability in smaller sample sizes.

The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the observed proportion of an event will more closely approach the true probability. In this case, the larger sample size (more babies born each day) at hospital 1 means that the daily percentage of boy births will be closer to the expected 50% compared to hospital 2.

Conversely, hospital 2, with its smaller number of daily births, will experience more variability in the percentage of boys born each day. This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born deviates significantly from the expected 50%, both above and below.

Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeded 60%.
