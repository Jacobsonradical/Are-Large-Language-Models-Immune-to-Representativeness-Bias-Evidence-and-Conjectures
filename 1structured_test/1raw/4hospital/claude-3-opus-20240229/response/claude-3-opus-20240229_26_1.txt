To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the impact of the sample size (number of babies born each day) on the variability of the percentage.

Smaller sample sizes tend to have higher variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day, as each individual birth has a larger impact on the overall percentage. Conversely, larger sample sizes tend to have a more stable percentage, closer to the expected 50%.

Given:
- Hospital 1: about 45 babies born each day
- Hospital 2: about 15 babies born each day

With Hospital 2 having a much smaller sample size, it is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the expected 50%. This means Hospital 2 is more likely to have a higher number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.
