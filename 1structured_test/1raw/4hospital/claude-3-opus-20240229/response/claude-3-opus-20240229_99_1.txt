To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

With a larger sample size (more babies born each day), the percentage of baby boys born will be closer to the expected value of 50%. In contrast, a smaller sample size leads to more variability in the daily percentage.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies born each day, so the percentage of baby boys born will likely be closer to 50% on most days. Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies born each day, which means there will be more variability in the daily percentage of baby boys born.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60% due to the higher variability in the smaller sample size.
