To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

With a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), there is more likely to be greater fluctuation in the daily percentage of baby boys born compared to a larger sample size (hospital 1 with about 45 babies per day). In other words, the percentage in hospital 2 is more likely to deviate from the average of 50% on any given day.

Therefore, hospital 2, despite having fewer babies born each day, is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeded 60%.
