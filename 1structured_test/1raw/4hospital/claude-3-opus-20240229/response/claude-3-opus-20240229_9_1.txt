To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boy births, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a larger sample size (more births per day), the percentage of boys born each day is likely to be closer to the expected average of 50%. With a smaller sample size, there's more likely to be random fluctuations and thus more days where the percentage deviates significantly from 50%.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 births per day, so the percentage of boys is likely to be closer to 50% on most days. Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 births per day, so the percentage is more likely to fluctuate further from 50% on any given day.

Therefore, Hospital 2, with the smaller sample size, is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
