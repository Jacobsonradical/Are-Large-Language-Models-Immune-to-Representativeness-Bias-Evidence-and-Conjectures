To determine which hospital likely recorded more days where over 60% of babies born were boys, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

In a smaller sample size, like the 15 babies born each day in hospital 2, there is more likely to be greater variability in the percentage of boys born compared to a larger sample size, like the 45 babies born each day in hospital 1. This is because each individual birth has a larger impact on the overall percentage in a smaller sample.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller daily birth rate, is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the average of 50%, including days where it exceeds 60%.

On the other hand, the larger daily birth rate in hospital 1 means the percentage of baby boys born each day is likely to be closer to the average of 50%, with fewer days where the percentage deviates significantly, such as exceeding 60%.

So, hospital 2 likely recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
