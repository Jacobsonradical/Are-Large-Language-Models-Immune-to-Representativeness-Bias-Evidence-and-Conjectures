To determine which hospital likely recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

In a smaller sample size, like the 15 daily births in hospital 2, there's more likely to be greater fluctuations in the percentage of boys born each day. With a larger sample size, like the 45 daily births in hospital 1, the percentage is more likely to be closer to the average of 50%.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller number of daily births, is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeded 60%.
