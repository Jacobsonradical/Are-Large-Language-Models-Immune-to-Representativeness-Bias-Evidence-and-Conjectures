To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

With a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), there is more likely to be random fluctuations in the percentage of boys born each day. These fluctuations can more easily lead to days where the percentage exceeds 60%.

On the other hand, the larger sample size of hospital 1 (about 45 babies per day) means the daily percentage of boys born is more likely to be closer to the expected value of 50%.

Therefore, even though the average percentage of boys born is the same for both hospitals, the smaller sample size of hospital 2 makes it more likely to have extreme proportions (like more than 60% boys) on any given day.
