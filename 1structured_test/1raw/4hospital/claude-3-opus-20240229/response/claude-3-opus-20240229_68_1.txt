To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a smaller sample size (fewer babies born each day), there is more likely to be greater fluctuation in the percentage of baby boys born on any given day. Conversely, a larger sample size tends to have less extreme variations and more closely approaches the average of 50%.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies born each day.

Therefore, Hospital 2, with its smaller daily birth rate, is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeded 60%.
