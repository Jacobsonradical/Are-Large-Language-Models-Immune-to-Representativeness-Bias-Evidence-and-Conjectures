To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

With a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), the percentage of baby boys born each day is more likely to deviate from the average of 50% compared to a larger sample size (hospital 1 with about 45 babies per day).

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller daily birth rate, is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeded 60%.
