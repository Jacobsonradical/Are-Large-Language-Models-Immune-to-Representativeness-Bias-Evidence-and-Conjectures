To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

According to the law of large numbers, as the sample size increases, the observed proportion of an event (in this case, baby boys being born) will more closely approximate the true probability (about 50%).

Since hospital 1 has a larger sample size (about 45 babies born each day) compared to hospital 2 (about 15 babies born each day), the percentage of baby boys born in hospital 1 is likely to be closer to the expected 50% on any given day. In contrast, hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to experience larger fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeded 60%.
