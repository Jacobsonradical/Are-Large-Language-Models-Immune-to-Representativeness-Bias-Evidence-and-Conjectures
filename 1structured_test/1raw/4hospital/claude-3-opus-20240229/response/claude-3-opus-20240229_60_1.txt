To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a smaller sample size (fewer babies born each day), there is more variability in the percentage of baby boys born day to day. Conversely, a larger sample size tends to have less variability, with the percentage staying closer to the average of 50%.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies born each day. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have extreme percentages (like over 60% boys) on any given day, simply due to the higher variability that comes with a smaller sample size.

Over the course of a year, Hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born compared to Hospital 1.
