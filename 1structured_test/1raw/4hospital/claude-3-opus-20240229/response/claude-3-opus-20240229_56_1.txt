To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

With a smaller sample size (fewer babies born each day), there is more likely to be greater variability in the percentage of baby boys from day to day. Conversely, a larger sample size tends to have less variability and is more likely to be closer to the expected average of 50%.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies born each day. Due to the smaller sample size, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the expected 50%, including days where it exceeds 60%.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 1.
