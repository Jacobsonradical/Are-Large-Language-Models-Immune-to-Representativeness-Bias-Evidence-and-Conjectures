To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the law of large numbers and the concept of variability in smaller sample sizes.

The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the observed proportion of an event (in this case, the proportion of baby boys born) will converge to the expected probability (50%).

In hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, the daily percentage of baby boys will be closer to the expected 50% due to the larger sample size. There will be less variability from day to day.

In hospital 2, with only about 15 babies born each day, the daily percentage of baby boys will be more likely to deviate from the expected 50% due to the smaller sample size. There will be more variability from day to day.

As a result, hospital 2 is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60%, as the smaller sample size allows for more extreme deviations from the expected probability.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 2}
