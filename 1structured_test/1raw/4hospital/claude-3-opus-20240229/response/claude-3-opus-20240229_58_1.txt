To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

In a smaller sample size, like the 15 daily births at hospital 2, there is more likely to be variability in the percentage of boys born compared to a larger sample size, like the 45 daily births at hospital 1. This is because each individual birth has a larger impact on the percentage in a smaller sample.

For example, if hospital 2 has 12 boys out of 15 babies one day, that's 80% boys. But if hospital 1 has 27 boys out of 45 babies, that's only 60% boys, even though the actual number of boys is larger.

Therefore, due to the smaller sample size, hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%, even though the long-term average is around 50% for both hospitals.
