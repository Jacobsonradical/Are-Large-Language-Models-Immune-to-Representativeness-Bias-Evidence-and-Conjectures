To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the law of large numbers and the variability in smaller sample sizes.

In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, which is a larger sample size compared to hospital 2, where only about 15 babies are born each day. With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys born in hospital 1 is more likely to be closer to the expected average of 50%.

On the other hand, hospital 2, with its smaller sample size of about 15 babies per day, is more likely to experience greater fluctuations in the daily percentage of baby boys born. This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys born deviates significantly from the expected average of 50%.

Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeded 60%.
