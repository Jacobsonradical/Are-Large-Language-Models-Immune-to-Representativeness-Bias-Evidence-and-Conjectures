To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the daily percentage.

With a larger sample size (more babies born each day), the daily percentage is less likely to deviate significantly from the average of 50%. Conversely, a smaller sample size leads to more variability in the daily percentage.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies born each day. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the average, surpassing the 60% threshold.
