To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the concept of variability in small sample sizes.

When the sample size is smaller, the percentage of baby boys born each day is more likely to deviate from the average of 50%. With a larger sample size, the daily percentages tend to be closer to the average.

Since hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15), the daily percentages of baby boys born in hospital 1 will likely be closer to the average of 50%. In contrast, hospital 2, with its smaller daily number of births, will likely have more days where the percentage deviates significantly from 50%, including more days above 60%.

Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born.
