To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

The key insight is that the smaller sample size (fewer babies born each day) in hospital 2 will lead to higher variability in the daily percentage of baby boys. With a larger sample size, as in hospital 1, the daily percentages will be closer to the average of 50%.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller sample size of about 15 babies per day, is more likely to have extreme results, such as days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

Hospital 1, with a larger sample size of about 45 babies per day, will have daily percentages more consistently close to the average of 50%, and thus less likely to have days exceeding 60% baby boys.

In conclusion, hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born compared to hospital 1.
