To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), there is more likely to be greater fluctuation in the daily percentage of boys born compared to a larger sample size (hospital 1 with about 45 babies per day). This means hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born deviates significantly from the average of 50%.

Therefore, hospital 2, despite having fewer births overall, is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
