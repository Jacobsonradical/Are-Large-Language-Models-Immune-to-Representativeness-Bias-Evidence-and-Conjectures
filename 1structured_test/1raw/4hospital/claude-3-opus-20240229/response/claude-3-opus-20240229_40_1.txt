To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

With a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), there is more likely to be random fluctuations in the percentage of boy babies born each day. In contrast, the larger sample size of hospital 1 (about 45 babies per day) will tend to have less extreme fluctuations, as the larger sample size more closely represents the true population proportion.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller daily birth rate, is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of boy babies exceeds 60% due to random chance.
