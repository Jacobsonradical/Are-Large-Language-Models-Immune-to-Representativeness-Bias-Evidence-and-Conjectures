To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

With a larger sample size (more babies born per day), the day-to-day variability in the percentage of baby boys will be smaller. Conversely, a smaller sample size leads to more variability.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have extreme percentages (like more than 60% boys) on any given day, simply due to random chance.

Over the course of a year, Hospital 2 is likely to have recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
