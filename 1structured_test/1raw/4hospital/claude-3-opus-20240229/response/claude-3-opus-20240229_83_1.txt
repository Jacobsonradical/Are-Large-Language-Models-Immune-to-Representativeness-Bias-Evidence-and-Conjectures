To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a larger sample size (more babies born each day), the percentage of baby boys born will tend to be closer to the expected average of 50%. With a smaller sample size, there is more variability in the daily percentage.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies per day, while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies per day. Due to the smaller sample size, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days that deviate significantly from the 50% average, i.e., days with more than 60% baby boys.

Therefore, Hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 1.
