To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

With a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), there is more likely to be greater fluctuation in the daily percentage of baby boys born compared to a larger sample size (hospital 1 with about 45 babies per day). This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have extreme percentages (like over 60% boys) on any given day, simply due to random chance.

Therefore, even though the overall percentage of baby boys born is around 50% for both hospitals, hospital 2, with its smaller daily birth count, is more likely to have recorded more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeded 60%.
