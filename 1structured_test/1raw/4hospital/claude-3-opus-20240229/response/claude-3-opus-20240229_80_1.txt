To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boy births, we need to consider the volatility of the percentage. With a smaller sample size, the percentage is more likely to deviate from the expected mean of 50%.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). This means the percentage of boy births in Hospital 1 is less likely to significantly deviate from the expected 50% compared to Hospital 2.

Therefore, Hospital 2, with its smaller daily birth count, is more likely to have days where the percentage of boy births exceeds 60% due to higher volatility.
