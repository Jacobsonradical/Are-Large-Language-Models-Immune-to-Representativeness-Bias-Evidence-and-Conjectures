To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

With a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), there is more likely to be greater fluctuation in the daily percentage of baby boys born compared to a larger sample size (hospital 1 with about 45 babies per day). This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have extreme results (like more than 60% boys) on any given day, simply due to random chance.

Over the course of a year, hospital 2 is expected to have more days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60%, as the smaller sample size allows for more variability.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 2}
