To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

The key insight is that the smaller sample size (fewer babies born each day) in hospital 2 will lead to more variability in the daily percentage of baby boys compared to the larger sample size in hospital 1.

With a larger sample size, the daily percentage will be closer to the average of 50%. With a smaller sample size, there is more room for the daily percentage to deviate from the average, resulting in more days where the percentage could exceed 60%.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller number of daily births, is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
