To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

In a smaller sample (hospital 2 with about 15 births per day), there is more variability in the percentage of boys born each day compared to a larger sample (hospital 1 with about 45 births per day). This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys is farther from the expected 50% compared to hospital 1.

Therefore, hospital 2, despite having fewer births overall, is more likely to have recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
