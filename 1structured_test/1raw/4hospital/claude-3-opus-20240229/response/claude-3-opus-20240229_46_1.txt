To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

With a larger sample size (more babies born per day), the percentage of baby boys will tend to be closer to the expected average of 50%. In contrast, a smaller sample size leads to more variability in the percentage from day to day.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies per day, so the percentage of baby boys will likely be closer to 50% on most days. Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies per day, so the percentage is more likely to deviate significantly from 50% on any given day.

Therefore, Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.
