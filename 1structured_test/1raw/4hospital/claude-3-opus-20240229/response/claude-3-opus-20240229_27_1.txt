To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

In a smaller sample size, like the 15 babies born daily in hospital 2, there is more likely to be greater variability in the percentage of boys born compared to a larger sample size, like the 45 babies born daily in hospital 1. This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys significantly deviates from the average of 50%.

Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
