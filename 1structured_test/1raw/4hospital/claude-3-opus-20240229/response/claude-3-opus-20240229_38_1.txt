To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the law of large numbers and the variability in smaller sample sizes.

With a larger sample size (more babies born each day), the percentage of baby boys born will tend to be closer to the average of 50%. In contrast, a smaller sample size will tend to have more variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size with about 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size with about 15 babies born each day. Due to the smaller sample size, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the average of 50%, including days where it exceeds 60%.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born compared to Hospital 1.
