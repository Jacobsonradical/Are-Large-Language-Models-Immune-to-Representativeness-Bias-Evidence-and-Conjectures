To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

With a smaller sample size (fewer births per day), there is more variability in the daily percentage of baby boys. Hospital 2, with about 15 births per day, will have more extreme percentages (like over 60% boys) occurring by chance more often than Hospital 1, which has a larger sample size of about 45 births per day.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% of baby boys born due to the smaller sample size leading to greater variability in the daily proportions.
