To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of boys born each day. With a smaller sample size, like in hospital 2, there is more likely to be greater variability in the percentage from day to day.

In hospital 1, with a larger sample size of about 45 babies per day, the percentage of boys born each day is more likely to be closer to the expected 50%. Deviations from 50% are less likely to be extreme.

In hospital 2, with only about 15 babies born each day, there is a higher chance of observing days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from 50%. For example, if on a given day 9 out of 15 babies born are boys, that's 60%, even though the actual number of boys born is small.

Therefore, due to the smaller sample size and higher variability expected in hospital 2, it is more likely that hospital 2 recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
