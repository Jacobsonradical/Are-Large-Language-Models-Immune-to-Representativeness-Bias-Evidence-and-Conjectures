To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

The key insight is that the smaller the sample size (i.e., the number of babies born each day), the more likely it is to deviate significantly from the average (50% boys). With a larger sample size, the percentage will tend to be closer to the average.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days that deviate significantly from the average, i.e., days with more than 60% baby boys.

For example, if Hospital 2 has 9 or more baby boys out of 15 on a given day, that would be 60% or more. This is more likely to happen by chance than Hospital 1 having 27 or more baby boys out of 45, which would also be 60% or more.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born due to its smaller sample size leading to higher variability.
