To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys, we need to consider the concept of variability in small sample sizes.

In a smaller sample size, like the 15 babies born daily in hospital 2, there is more variability in the percentage of boys born each day compared to a larger sample size, like the 45 babies born daily in hospital 1. This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have extreme percentages (like more than 60% boys) on any given day, simply due to random chance.

On the other hand, the larger sample size in hospital 1 will tend to have percentages closer to the average of 50% each day, as the random variations even out more with a larger number of babies.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller sample size and higher variability, likely recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys compared to hospital 1.
