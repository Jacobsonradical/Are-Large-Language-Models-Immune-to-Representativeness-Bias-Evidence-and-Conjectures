To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a larger sample size (more babies born each day), the percentage of baby boys born will tend to be closer to the expected average of 50%. With a smaller sample size, there is more variability and a higher likelihood of deviating significantly from the average on any given day.

Hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, has a larger sample size compared to Hospital 2, which has only about 15 babies born each day. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys born deviates significantly from the average, exceeding 60%.

In conclusion, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born due to its smaller sample size and higher variability.
