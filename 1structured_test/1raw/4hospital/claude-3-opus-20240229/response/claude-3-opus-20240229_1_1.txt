To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a larger sample size (more babies born each day), the percentage of baby boys born will tend to be closer to the average of 50%. With a smaller sample size, there is more room for the percentage to deviate from the average due to random chance.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (about 45 babies born each day), so the percentage of baby boys born each day is likely to be closer to 50%. It's less likely to have days where the percentage deviates significantly from 50%, such as over 60%.

Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size (about 15 babies born each day), so the percentage of baby boys born each day is more likely to fluctuate due to random chance. It's more likely to have days where the percentage deviates significantly from 50%, such as over 60%.

Therefore, Hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born compared to Hospital 1.
