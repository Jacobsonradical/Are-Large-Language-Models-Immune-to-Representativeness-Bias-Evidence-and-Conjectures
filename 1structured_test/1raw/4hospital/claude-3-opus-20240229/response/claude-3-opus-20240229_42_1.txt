To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boy births, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of boy births. With a smaller sample size (fewer births per day), there is more likely to be greater variability in the percentage of boys born each day.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies born each day, so the percentage of boys born is likely to be closer to the average of 50% on most days.

Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies per day, so the percentage of boys born each day is more likely to deviate from the average of 50%. This means Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born is over 60%.

Therefore, Hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% of the babies born being boys.
