To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a smaller sample size (fewer babies born each day), there is more likely to be random fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys born on any given day. Hospital 2, with only about 15 babies born each day, is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the average of 50%.

On the other hand, Hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, will have a more stable percentage of baby boys born each day, as the larger sample size reduces the impact of random variations.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeded 60%, due to its smaller sample size and higher variability in the daily percentage.
