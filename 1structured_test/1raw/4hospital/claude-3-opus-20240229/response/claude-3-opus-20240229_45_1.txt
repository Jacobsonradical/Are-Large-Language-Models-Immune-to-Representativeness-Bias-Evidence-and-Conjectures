To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boys born, we need to consider the law of large numbers and the variability in smaller sample sizes.

In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, while in hospital 2, only about 15 babies are born each day. The larger sample size in hospital 1 means that the daily percentage of boys born is more likely to be closer to the expected 50%. In contrast, the smaller sample size in hospital 2 will lead to more variability in the daily percentage of boys born.

As a result, hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born deviates significantly from the expected 50%, exceeding the 60% threshold more often than hospital 1.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 2}
