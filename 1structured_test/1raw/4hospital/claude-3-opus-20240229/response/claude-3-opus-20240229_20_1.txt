To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), there is more likely to be large fluctuations in the daily percentage of baby boys born. On the other hand, a larger sample size (hospital 1 with about 45 babies per day) tends to have less extreme fluctuations and more closely approximates the average of 50%.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller daily birth rate, is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60%.
