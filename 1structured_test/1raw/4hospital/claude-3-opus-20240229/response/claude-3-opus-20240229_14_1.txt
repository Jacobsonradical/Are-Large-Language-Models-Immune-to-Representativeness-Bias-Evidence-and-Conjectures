To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the law of large numbers and the variability in smaller sample sizes.

The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the observed probability gets closer to the true probability. This means that for hospital 1, which has a larger number of babies born each day (45), the daily percentage of baby boys born will be closer to the expected 50%. There will be less variability from day to day.

On the other hand, hospital 2 has a smaller number of babies born each day (15). With a smaller sample size, there is more likely to be greater variability in the daily percentage of baby boys born. Some days may have a much higher or lower percentage than the expected 50%.

Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 2, with the smaller daily number of babies born, recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. The smaller sample size allows for more extreme deviations from the expected probability.
