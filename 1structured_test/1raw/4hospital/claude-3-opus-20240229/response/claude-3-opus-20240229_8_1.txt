To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

With a smaller sample size (fewer babies born each day), there is more variability in the daily percentage of baby boys. This means Hospital 2, with only about 15 babies born each day, is more likely to have extreme percentages (like over 60% boys) on any given day, compared to Hospital 1 with its larger sample size of about 45 babies per day.

Therefore, over the course of a year, Hospital 2 likely had more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeded 60%.
