To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

With a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with about 15 births per day), there is more likely to be greater fluctuation in the daily percentage of baby boys born compared to a larger sample size (hospital 1 with about 45 births per day). This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have extreme proportions (like more than 60% boys) on any given day, simply due to random chance.

Therefore, over the course of a year, hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born compared to hospital 1.
