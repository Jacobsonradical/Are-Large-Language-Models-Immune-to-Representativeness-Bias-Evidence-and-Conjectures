To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

In a smaller sample (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), there is more likely to be greater variability in the percentage of boys born compared to a larger sample (hospital 1 with about 45 babies per day). This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the average of 50%.

Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
