To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

With a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), there is more likely to be greater fluctuation in the daily percentage of boys born compared to a larger sample size (hospital 1 with about 45 babies per day). This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have extreme percentages (like above 60% boys) on any given day, simply due to random chance.

On the other hand, the larger sample size of hospital 1 means the daily percentages are more likely to be closer to the overall average of 50% boys.

Therefore, hospital 2, despite having fewer births overall, likely recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
