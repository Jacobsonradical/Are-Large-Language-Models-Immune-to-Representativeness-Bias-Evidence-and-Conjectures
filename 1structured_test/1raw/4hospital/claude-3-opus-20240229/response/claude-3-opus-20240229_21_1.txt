To determine which hospital recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day. The key insight is that the smaller sample size (fewer babies born per day) will have higher variability in the daily percentage of baby boys.

With a larger sample size (more babies born each day), the daily percentages will be closer to the average of 50%.

Therefore, hospital 2, which has fewer babies born each day (about 15), is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the average, exceeding 60%.

Hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, will have daily percentages more consistently close to the average of 50%, and thus less likely to exceed 60% on any given day.

So, hospital 2 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born compared to hospital 1.
