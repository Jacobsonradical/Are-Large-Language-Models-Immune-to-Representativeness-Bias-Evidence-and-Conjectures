To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of the percentage.

The smaller the sample size (i.e., the number of babies born each day), the more likely it is to have extreme percentages that deviate from the expected 50% boys. In contrast, larger sample sizes tend to have percentages closer to the expected value.

Given:
- Hospital 1: about 45 babies born each day
- Hospital 2: about 15 babies born each day

Since Hospital 2 has a much smaller number of babies born each day, it is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the expected 50%. This means Hospital 2 is more likely to have a higher number of days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 2}
