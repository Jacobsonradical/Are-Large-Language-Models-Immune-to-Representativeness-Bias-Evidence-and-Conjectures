To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

With a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with about 15 babies per day), there is more variability in the daily percentage of baby boys. This means that it's more likely for hospital 2 to have days where the percentage deviates significantly from the average of 50%.

On the other hand, hospital 1, with a larger sample size of about 45 babies per day, will have less variability in the daily percentage. The larger sample size tends to produce results closer to the average of 50% each day.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller sample size and higher variability, is more likely to have recorded more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeded 60%.
