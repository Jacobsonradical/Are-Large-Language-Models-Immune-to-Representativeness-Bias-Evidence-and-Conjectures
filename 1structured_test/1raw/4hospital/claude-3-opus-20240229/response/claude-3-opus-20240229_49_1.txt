To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

According to the law of large numbers, as the sample size increases, the sample mean tends to approach the expected value. In this case, the larger the number of babies born in a hospital each day, the more likely the percentage of baby boys will be closer to the expected 50%.

Since hospital 1 has a much larger number of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15), the percentage of baby boys born in hospital 1 is likely to be closer to 50% on any given day. In contrast, the smaller sample size in hospital 2 will lead to greater variability in the daily percentage of baby boys.

As a result, hospital 2 is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%, due to the higher variability in the smaller sample size.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 2}
