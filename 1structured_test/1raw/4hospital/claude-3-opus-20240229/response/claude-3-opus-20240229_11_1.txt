To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

The smaller the sample size (number of babies born per day), the more likely it is to deviate significantly from the average of 50% on any given day. Conversely, a larger sample size tends to have less extreme fluctuations and stays closer to the average.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 babies per day, while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies per day. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the average, exceeding 60%.

Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is less likely to have extreme deviations from the average.

In conclusion, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born.
