To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys, we need to consider the effect of the sample size (number of babies born each day) on the variability of the percentage.

With a smaller sample size, there is more variability in the percentage from day to day. Hospital 2, with only about 15 babies born each day, will have more extreme percentages (like over 60% boys) more often than Hospital 1, which has a larger sample size of about 45 babies per day.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, due to the higher variability in the daily percentages.
