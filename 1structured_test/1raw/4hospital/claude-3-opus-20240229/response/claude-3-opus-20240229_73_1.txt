To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boy births, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

With a larger sample size (more births per day), the actual percentage of boys born each day is likely to be closer to the expected value of 50%. Conversely, a smaller sample size leads to more variability in the daily percentage.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of about 45 births per day, while Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of about 15 births per day. Therefore, the percentage of boy births in Hospital 2 is more likely to deviate from the expected 50% compared to Hospital 1, due to higher variability.

As a result, Hospital 2 is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of boy births exceeds 60%.
