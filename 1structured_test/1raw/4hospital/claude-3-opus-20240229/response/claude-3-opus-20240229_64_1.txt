To determine which hospital is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of boys born each day.

In a smaller sample size, like hospital 2 with about 15 babies born each day, there is more room for variability in the percentage of boys born on any given day. With a larger sample size, like hospital 1 with about 45 babies born each day, the percentage of boys born is more likely to be closer to the average of 50%.

Therefore, hospital 2, with the smaller number of daily births, is more likely to have a higher number of days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
