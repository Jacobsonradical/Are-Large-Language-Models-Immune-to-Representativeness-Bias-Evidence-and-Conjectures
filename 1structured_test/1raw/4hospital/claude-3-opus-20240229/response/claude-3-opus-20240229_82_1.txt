To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the law of large numbers and the variability in smaller sample sizes.

With a larger sample size (more births per day), the percentage of baby boys born each day is likely to be closer to the average of 50%. Hospital 1, with about 45 births per day, has a larger sample size compared to Hospital 2, which has only about 15 births per day.

In the smaller sample size of Hospital 2, there is more likely to be greater variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day. This means that Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the average of 50%, exceeding the 60% threshold.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born compared to Hospital 1.
