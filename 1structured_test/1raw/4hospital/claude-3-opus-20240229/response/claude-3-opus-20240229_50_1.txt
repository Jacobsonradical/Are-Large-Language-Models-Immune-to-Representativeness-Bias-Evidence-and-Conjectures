To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

The key insight is that the smaller sample size (fewer babies born each day) in hospital 2 will lead to more variability in the daily percentage of baby boys. With a larger sample size, as in hospital 1, the daily percentages will be closer to the expected average of 50%.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller number of daily births, is more likely to have extreme percentages, such as days over 60% baby boys.

Hospital 1, with a larger sample size, will have daily percentages more consistently close to the average and thus less likely to have as many days exceeding 60%.

So hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born.
