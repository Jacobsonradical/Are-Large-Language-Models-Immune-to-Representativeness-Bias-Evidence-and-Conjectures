To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the effect of sample size on the variability of proportions.

In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, while in hospital 2, only about 15 babies are born each day. The smaller sample size in hospital 2 means that the percentage of baby boys born each day is more likely to deviate from the expected 50% due to random chance.

With a larger sample size, as in hospital 1, the daily percentages are more likely to be closer to the expected value of 50%.

Therefore, hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60% due to random fluctuations.
