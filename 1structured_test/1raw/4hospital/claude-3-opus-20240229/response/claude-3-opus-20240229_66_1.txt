To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the law of large numbers and the variability in smaller sample sizes.

With a larger sample size (more babies born per day), the percentage of baby boys born each day is likely to be closer to the expected average of 50%. In contrast, a smaller sample size (fewer babies born per day) will tend to have more variability in the daily percentage of baby boys.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size with about 45 babies born each day, so the daily percentage of baby boys is likely to be closer to 50% and less likely to exceed 60%.

Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size with about 15 babies born each day, so the daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to deviate from 50% and could more often exceed 60%.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born due to the higher variability in the smaller sample size.
