To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day.

The key insight is that the smaller sample size (fewer births per day) in hospital 2 will lead to more variability in the daily percentage of baby boys compared to the larger sample size in hospital 1.

With a larger sample size, the daily percentage will more closely approximate the true average (about 50%), while a smaller sample size allows for more extreme fluctuations from the average.

Therefore, hospital 2, with only about 15 babies born each day, is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys significantly deviates from the average, exceeding 60%.

Hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, will have a more stable daily percentage closer to the average due to the larger sample size.

In conclusion, hospital 2 likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born compared to hospital 1.
