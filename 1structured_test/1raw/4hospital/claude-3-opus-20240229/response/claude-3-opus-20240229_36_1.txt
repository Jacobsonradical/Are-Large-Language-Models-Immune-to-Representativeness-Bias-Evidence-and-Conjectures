To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the concept of variability in smaller sample sizes.

In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, while in hospital 2, only about 15 babies are born each day. Although the average percentage of baby boys is 50% for both hospitals, the daily fluctuations in the percentage will be more pronounced in the smaller sample size of hospital 2.

With a smaller sample size, each individual data point (in this case, each baby boy or girl) has a larger impact on the percentage. Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the average of 50%, both above and below.

Consequently, hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeded 60% compared to hospital 1, which has a larger sample size and thus less variability in the daily percentages.
