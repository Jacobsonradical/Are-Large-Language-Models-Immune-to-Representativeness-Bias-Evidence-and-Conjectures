To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, we need to consider the concept of variability in smaller sample sizes.

In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day, while in hospital 2, only about 15 babies are born each day. Although the average percentage of baby boys is 50%, the actual percentage will fluctuate more in the smaller sample size (hospital 2) compared to the larger sample size (hospital 1).

This means that hospital 2, with its smaller daily birth count, is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the average of 50%. Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
