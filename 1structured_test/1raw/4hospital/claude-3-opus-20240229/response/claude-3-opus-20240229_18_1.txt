To determine which hospital likely recorded more days with over 60% boys born, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of boys born each day. With a smaller sample size (fewer births per day), there is more likely to be greater variability in the percentage of boys born from day to day.

Given:
- Hospital 1: about 45 babies born each day
- Hospital 2: about 15 babies born each day

Since Hospital 2 has a much smaller number of births each day, the percentage of boys born is more likely to deviate from the average of 50% on any given day. This means Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

On the other hand, Hospital 1, with a larger number of births each day, is more likely to have the percentage of boys born closer to the average of 50% on most days.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys.
