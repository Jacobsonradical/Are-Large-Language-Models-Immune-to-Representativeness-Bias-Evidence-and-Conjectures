{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2 recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the law of large numbers: in hospital 1, with a larger sample size of about 45 births per day, the daily percentage of boys is more likely to be closer to the overall average of 50%. In contrast, hospital 2, with about 15 births per day, will have a greater day-to-day variability, resulting in a higher likelihood of observing days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.
