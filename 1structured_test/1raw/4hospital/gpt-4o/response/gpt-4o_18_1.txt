To determine which hospital is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys, we need to consider the concept of variation, specifically in small sample sizes.

Hospital 1 has about 45 births per day, whereas Hospital 2 has about 15 births per day. When it comes to proportions, smaller sample sizes typically exhibit greater variability. This can be understood through the lens of the law of large numbers: the larger the sample size, the closer the proportion of outcomes will be to the expected value (in this case, 50% boys).

Given the smaller sample size, Hospital 2 (with 15 births per day) is more likely to experience days where the proportion of boys deviates from the expected 50% more significantly than Hospital 1 (with 45 births per day).

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys because the percentages will fluctuate more with the smaller sample size.
