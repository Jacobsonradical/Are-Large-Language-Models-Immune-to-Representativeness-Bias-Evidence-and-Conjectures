{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, where fewer babies are born each day (about 15), is more likely to have a higher variance in the percentage of boys born on any given day. Smaller sample sizes are more subject to variability due to random fluctuations. Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have more days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60% compared to hospital 1, which has more consistent results due to the larger number of births (about 45).
