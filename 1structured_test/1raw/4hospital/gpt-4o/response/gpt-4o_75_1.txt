{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2 is likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys. This is because the smaller sample size (15 babies per day) is more susceptible to larger fluctuations due to the law of small numbers, leading to a higher probability of observing a percentage over 60% compared to the larger sample size (45 babies per day) in Hospital 1.
