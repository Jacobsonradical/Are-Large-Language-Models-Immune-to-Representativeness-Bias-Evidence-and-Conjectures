{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, with fewer babies born each day, is more likely to observe larger fluctuations in the percentage of boys born on a day-to-day basis due to the smaller sample size. This statistical variation makes it more probable for Hospital 2 to have a higher number of days with more than 60% of the babies being boys.
