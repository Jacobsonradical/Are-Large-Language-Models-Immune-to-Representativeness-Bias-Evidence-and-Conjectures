{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, which has fewer births per day (about 15), is more likely to see larger fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys relative to hospital 1, which averages 45 births per day. This is an application of the law of large numbers â€” with a smaller sample size, we expect more variability. Thus, hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where the proportion of boys exceeds 60%.
