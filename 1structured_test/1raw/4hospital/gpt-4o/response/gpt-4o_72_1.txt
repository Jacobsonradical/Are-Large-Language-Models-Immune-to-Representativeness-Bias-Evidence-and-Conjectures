{hospital: 2}

Explanation: Hospital 2, with fewer babies born each day (15 compared to 45 in hospital 1), is more likely to experience larger relative fluctuations in the percentage of boys born each day due to its smaller sample size. This increased variability means that it is more probable for hospital 2 to record days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys compared to hospital 1.
