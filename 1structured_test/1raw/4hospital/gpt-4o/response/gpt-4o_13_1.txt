{hospital: 2}

This is because the smaller sample size in hospital 2 (with about 15 babies born each day) is more likely to exhibit greater variation in percentages, including having more days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%, compared to hospital 1 (with about 45 babies born each day) where the larger sample size tends to exhibit less day-to-day variation due to the law of large numbers.
