{hospital: 2}

The hospital with the smaller number of births (hospital 2) is likely to see more variability in the percentage of boys born on a given day due to the smaller sample size. As a result, it's more likely to have more days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%. Therefore, hospital 2 will likely have recorded more such days.
