{hospital: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is based on the law of large numbers and variability in smaller sample sizes. Hospital 2, with fewer births per day (15 compared to 45 at hospital 1), will exhibit more variability in terms of the percentage of boys born each day. Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 2 will have more days where the percentage of boys born is significantly higher or lower than 50%, including days where it exceeds 60%.
