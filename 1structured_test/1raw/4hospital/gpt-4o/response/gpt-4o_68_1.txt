{hospital: 2}

This outcome can be reasoned through the statistical principle known as the law of large numbers. Hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, has a larger sample size compared to hospital 2, which has about 15 babies born each day. With larger sample sizes, the proportion of baby boys is more likely to hover around the expected 50%. In contrast, with smaller sample sizes, such as in hospital 2, there is greater variability day-to-day, which increases the chance of recording days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. Hence, hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where the percentage of boys is greater than 60%.
