To determine which hospital recorded more days with more than 60% of births being boys, we need to consider the concept of statistical variance. Hospital 2, with fewer births per day (about 15), will have higher day-to-day variability in the percentage of boys compared to Hospital 1, which has more births per day (about 45). When the sample size is smaller, the observed proportions can deviate more easily from the expected 50% rate due to random fluctuations.

Hospital 2 is therefore more likely to have a greater number of days with extreme variations (such as more than 60% boys) simply because of the higher variability due to the smaller number of births.

Thus, the answer is:

{hospital: 2}
