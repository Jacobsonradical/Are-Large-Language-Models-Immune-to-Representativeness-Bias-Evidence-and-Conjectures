{hospital: 2}

This is because the smaller the sample size, the higher the variance in the percentage of boys born. Therefore, hospital 2, which has fewer births per day (15 babies), is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from the average 50%, compared to hospital 1, which has a larger sample size (45 babies). Thus, hospital 2 is likely to have more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.
