The key idea here involves the concept of variability or statistical fluctuation. When you have a smaller sample size, such as hospital 2 with 15 babies born each day, percentages are more likely to deviate from the expected value of 50%. This is due to the law of large numbers, which states that as a sample size grows, its sample mean gets closer to the population mean. Thus, smaller samples can show larger variations.

Hospital 2, with fewer births each day, will be more subject to such variability and thus is more likely to have more days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%.

Hence, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
