{hospital: 2}

The reason is that hospital 2, with fewer births per day (15 babies), will have a larger variance in the percentage of baby boys compared to hospital 1 with 45 births per day. Smaller sample sizes tend to have greater variability, so it is more likely that hospital 2 will have more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.
