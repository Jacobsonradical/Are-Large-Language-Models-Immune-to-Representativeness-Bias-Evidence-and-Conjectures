{hospital: 2}

Explanation: Hospital 2 is likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys. This is because of the law of large numbers and variability. With Hospital 1 having about 45 babies born each day, the results will tend to cluster closer to the 50% average because of the larger sample size, leading to less variability. In contrast, Hospital 2, with only about 15 babies born each day, will have more variability and therefore a higher chance of having days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.
