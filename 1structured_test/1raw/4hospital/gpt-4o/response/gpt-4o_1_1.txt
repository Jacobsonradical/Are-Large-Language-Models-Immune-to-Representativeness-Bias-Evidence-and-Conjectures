{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, which has fewer births each day, is more likely to experience larger statistical fluctuations in the percentage of boys born on any given day. This is because smaller sample sizes tend to have greater variability. Thus, hospital 2 is likely to record more days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys compared to hospital 1, which has a larger sample size and therefore less daily variation.
