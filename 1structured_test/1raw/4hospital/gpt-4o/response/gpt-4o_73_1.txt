{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, with a smaller number of births (about 15 per day), is more likely to experience larger fluctuations in the percentage of boys born on any given day due to the smaller sample size. This means that it is more likely to record more days with over 60% of the babies being boys compared to Hospital 1, which has a larger sample size (about 45 births per day) and thus tends to have its daily percentage closer to the overall average of 50%.
