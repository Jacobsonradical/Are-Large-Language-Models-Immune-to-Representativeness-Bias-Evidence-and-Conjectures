To determine which hospital recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys, we need to consider the variability in the proportion of boys born each day. 

Here's a step-by-step rationale:

1. **Law of Large Numbers**: This statistical principle states that the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value. For hospital 1, the number of babies born each day is high (45), so the daily proportion of boys should be closer to the expected 50%. For hospital 2, with only 15 births per day, there's more variability; we're likely to see greater fluctuation around the 50% mark.

2. **Standard Deviation**: The variability can be assessed using standard deviation. For a binomial distribution, the standard deviation (σ) is √(np(1-p)), where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success (0.5 for boys). Calculating this:
   - Hospital 1: √(45 * 0.5 * 0.5) ≈ 3.35
   - Hospital 2: √(15 * 0.5 * 0.5) ≈ 1.94

Although the standard deviation is higher in hospital 1, the proportion (relative variability) in hospital 2 is more significant because the 'n' is smaller.

3. **Probability of Extreme Outcomes**: With fewer births per day in hospital 2, the probability of having days with more than 60% of boys is higher because smaller sample sizes tend to have larger proportional variances from the mean.

Given these points, hospital 2 is likely to record more days where the proportion of boys exceeds 60%.
