{hospital: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is driven by the Law of Large Numbers. In hospital 1, where about 45 babies are born each day, the percentage of boys will tend to be closer to the 50% average due to the larger sample size. However, in hospital 2, where about 15 babies are born each day, the percentage will exhibit greater day-to-day variability due to the smaller sample size. Consequently, hospital 2 is more likely to experience days where the percentage of boys is significantly higher than 60%.
