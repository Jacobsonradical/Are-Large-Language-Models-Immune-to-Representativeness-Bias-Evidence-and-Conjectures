The number of births in each hospital impacts the variability in the percentage of babies born on any given day. Hospital 1 has about 45 births per day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 births per day. With a larger number of births, the daily percentage of boys or girls in a hospital will tend to hover closer to the expected average due to the Law of Large Numbers. Conversely, with fewer births, there is more room for variability.

Since Hospital 2 has fewer births per day, it is more likely to experience significant fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys or girls on any given day. Therefore, Hospital 2 is expected to have more days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%.
