{hospital: 2}

Hereâ€™s the reasoning: The probability of observing an extreme value (such as more than 60% boys) is higher when the sample size is smaller. Hospital 2, with an average of 15 babies born each day, has a smaller sample size compared to Hospital 1, which has an average of 45 babies born each day. Smaller sample sizes tend to have more variability, therefore, Hospital 2 is expected to record more days where the percentage of boys is above 60%.
