{hospital: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that the hospital with fewer births per day (hospital 2) is more likely to experience greater deviations from the expected 50% of baby boys due to the smaller sample size. In statistics, smaller samples are more susceptible to variations, meaning hospital 2, with about 15 babies born each day, is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60% compared to hospital 1, which has a larger sample size of about 45 babies per day. This concept is rooted in the law of large numbers, which states that larger sample sizes tend to have proportions that are closer to the expected value, while smaller sample sizes exhibit greater variability.
