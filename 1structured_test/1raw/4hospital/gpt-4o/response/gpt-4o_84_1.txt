{hospital: 2}

The key concept here is the Law of Large Numbers, which states that as a sample size grows, its average will tend to get closer to the expected value. Hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, has a larger sample size than Hospital 2, with about 15 babies born each day.

This larger sample size means that the percentage of boys born each day in Hospital 1 is likely to be closer to the expected value of 50%. Conversely, Hospital 2, with fewer births each day, will experience greater fluctuations in the percentage of boys. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
