{hospital: 2}

Reasoning: Hospital 2, with about 15 babies born each day, is likely to record more days with a proportion greater than 60% boys due to the larger variability in smaller sample sizes. In smaller groups, deviations from the expected 50% are more common due to the greater impact of chance.
