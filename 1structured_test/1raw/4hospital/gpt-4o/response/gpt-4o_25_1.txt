{hospital: 2}

Explanation: The variability in percentages is more pronounced in smaller sample sizes. Hospital 2, which has fewer births per day (about 15), is likely to experience a higher day-to-day variation in the percentage of boys born compared to Hospital 1, which has more births per day (about 45). Therefore, Hospital 2 is expected to record more days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%.
