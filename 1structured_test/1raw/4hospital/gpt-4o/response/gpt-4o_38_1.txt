{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, with fewer births per day (about 15 compared to 45 in Hospital 1), is more likely to record a higher proportion of days with greater than 60% of the babies being boys. This is because smaller sample sizes tend to exhibit greater variability. Therefore, the fluctuations in the percentage of boys can easily exceed 60% more frequently in Hospital 2 than in Hospital 1.
