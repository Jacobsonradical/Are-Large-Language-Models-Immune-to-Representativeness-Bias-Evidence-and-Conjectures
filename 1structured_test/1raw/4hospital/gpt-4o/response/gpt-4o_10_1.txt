{hospital: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

The key concept here is the law of large numbers and the variability associated with small sample sizes. Hospital 2, with only about 15 babies born each day, will experience more variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day compared to Hospital 1, which has a larger sample size of about 45 babies each day.

In smaller samples, deviations from the expected 50% can be more pronounced. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%. 

Hence, Hospital 2 would record more such days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys.
