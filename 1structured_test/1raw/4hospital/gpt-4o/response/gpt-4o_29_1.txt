{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where over 60% of the babies born are boys due to the law of large numbers. In Hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, the daily percentage is less variable because the sample size is larger. In Hospital 2, with about 15 babies born each day, the smaller sample size means there's more variability, leading to a higher chance of seeing extreme percentages (such as more than 60% boys) on any given day.
