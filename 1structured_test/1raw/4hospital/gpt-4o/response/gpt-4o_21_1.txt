{hospital: 2}

The reason is due to the law of large numbers, which states that larger sample sizes tend to produce averages closer to the expected value (in this case, 50% boys). Hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, has a larger sample size compared to Hospital 2, which has about 15 babies born each day. Consequently, the daily percentage of boys in Hospital 1 will typically be closer to 50%, and there will be less variation. In contrast, Hospital 2's smaller sample size will have more day-to-day fluctuation, increasing the likelihood of days where the percentage of boys is much higher or lower than 50%. As a result, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.
