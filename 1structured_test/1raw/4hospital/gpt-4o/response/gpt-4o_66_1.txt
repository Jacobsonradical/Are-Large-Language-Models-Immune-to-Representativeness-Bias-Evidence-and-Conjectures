{hospital: 2}

Explanation: When dealing with probabilities and sample sizes, a smaller sample size tends to have more variation and is more likely to deviate from the expected average. Hospital 2, with about 15 babies born each day, will show higher variability in the proportion of baby boys compared to Hospital 1, which has about 45 babies born each day. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where the percentage of boys is higher than 60%, simply due to greater variability in the smaller sample size.
