{hospital: 2}

The reasoning behind this is related to the concept of sampling variability. Hospital 2, which has fewer births per day (about 15), is more likely to experience larger day-to-day fluctuations in the percentage of boys being born. In statistical terms, smaller sample sizes tend to have higher variances. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 2 recorded more days with the percentage of baby boys exceeding 60%, due to the higher variability in the smaller sample size.
