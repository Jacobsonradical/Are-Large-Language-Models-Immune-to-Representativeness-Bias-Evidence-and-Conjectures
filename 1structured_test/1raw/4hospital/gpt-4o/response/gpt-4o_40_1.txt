{hospital: 2}

Explanation: Hospital 2, where around 15 babies are born each day, is more likely to experience significant variations in the percentage of boys born on any given day. This is due to the law of large numbers, which states that in larger sample sizes (such as in Hospital 1 with 45 babies born each day), the daily percentage of boys is more likely to be closer to the expected 50%. In contrast, smaller sample sizes (such as in Hospital 2) have greater variability and are therefore more likely to have days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from the mean, including having more than 60% of boys. Consequently, Hospital 2 would record more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.
