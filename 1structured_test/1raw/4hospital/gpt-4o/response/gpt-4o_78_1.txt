{hospital: 2}

The key idea here is related to the concept of variability and sample size. Hospital 2, with fewer births per day (15 babies), will exhibit a higher day-to-day variance in the percentage of boys compared to Hospital 1, which has more births per day (45 babies). This higher variance means that Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from the 50% average, making it more likely for there to be days with more than 60% boys. Hence, Hospital 2 is expected to record more such days.
