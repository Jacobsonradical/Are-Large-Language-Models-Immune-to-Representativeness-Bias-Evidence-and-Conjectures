{hospital: 2}

Reasoning: The key factor here is the sample size of babies born each day in the two hospitals. Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (about 45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (about 15 babies per day). With a larger sample size, the proportion of boys born each day is more likely to hover around the 50% average due to the law of large numbers. In contrast, the smaller sample size in Hospital 2 is more susceptible to larger fluctuations in the percentage of boys born each day. Therefore, Hospital 2 is likelier to record more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.
