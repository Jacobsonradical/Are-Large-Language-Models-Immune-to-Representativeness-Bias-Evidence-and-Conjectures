{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, which has fewer births per day (about 15), is more likely to observe days where there is a greater deviation from the 50% norm due to the smaller sample size. This smaller sample size means that random fluctuations can have a more pronounced effect, making it more likely for Hospital 2 to record days on which more than 60% of the babies born are boys. In contrast, the larger number of births per day in Hospital 1 (about 45) causes the law of large numbers to reduce the variability, making such extreme deviations less common. Therefore, Hospital 2 likely recorded more such days.
