{hospital: 2}

This is because smaller samples tend to have greater variability in percentages. Hospital 2, with only about 15 babies born each day, is more likely to see days where the percentage of boys varies significantly from the expected 50%, resulting in a higher number of days with more than 60% boys compared to Hospital 1, which has about 45 births per day and thus a more stable percentage closer to 50%.
