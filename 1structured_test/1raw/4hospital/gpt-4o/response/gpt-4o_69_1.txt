{hospital: 2}

Explanation:

The key concept here is the law of large numbers and the variability associated with sample sizes. 

Hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, has a larger sample size. Hospital 2, with about 15 babies born each day, has a smaller sample size. When the sample size is smaller, the proportion of babies that are boys (or girls) can deviate more from the expected 50% due to increased variability. Therefore, on any given day, it is more likely that Hospital 2 will have a proportion of baby boys that is higher than 60%, compared to Hospital 1. 

So, Hospital 2 is expected to record more days where the percentage of baby boys born is greater than 60%.
