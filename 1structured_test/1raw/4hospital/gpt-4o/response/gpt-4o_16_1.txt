{hospital: 2}

Explanation: The percentage of days with more than 60% boys is influenced by the sample size (number of babies born each day). Hospital 2, having fewer births per day (15 babies) compared to Hospital 1 (45 babies), will experience greater variability in the proportion of boys due to smaller sample size. 

In statistical terms, the variability (or standard deviation) of the proportion of boys on any given day is inversely related to the square root of the sample size. Therefore, Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, will have a higher day-to-day variability in the proportion of boys. This makes it more likely that Hospital 2 will record more days with an extreme proportion (more than 60%) of boys compared to Hospital 1.
