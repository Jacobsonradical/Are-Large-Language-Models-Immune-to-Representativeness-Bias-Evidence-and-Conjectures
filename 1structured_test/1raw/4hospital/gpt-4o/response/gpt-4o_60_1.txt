To determine which hospital is more likely to record more days with over 60% baby boys, we need to consider the law of large numbers and statistical variation.

Hospital 1 has about 45 births per day, while Hospital 2 has about 15 births per day. When the number of births per day is higher, the daily percentage of boys will generally be closer to the expected value of 50% due to the law of large numbers. Hence, Hospital 1, with its higher number of births, should see less daily variation from the 50% mark compared to Hospital 2.

On the other hand, Hospital 2, with only about 15 births per day, is more prone to variability. This means it is more likely to have more days when the percentage of boys born deviates from the expected 50%, and thus, a higher chance for days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 2 recorded more days with over 60% of the babies being boys.
