{hospital: 2}

Explanation: This situation is related to the concept of statistical variability and the law of large numbers. In a given period, days with more than 60% boys are considered “extreme” events. Larger sample sizes (like hospital 1’s 45 babies per day) will likely result in percentages that are closer to the expected 50%, while smaller sample sizes (like hospital 2’s 15 babies per day) are more prone to variability and therefore more likely to experience these extreme events. Therefore, hospital 2 is expected to record more days with over 60% baby boys.
