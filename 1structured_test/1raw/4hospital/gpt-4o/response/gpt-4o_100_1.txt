{hospital: 2}

The reason why hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys is due to the smaller sample size. With fewer births per day (about 15), the daily percentage of boys is more likely to deviate from the expected 50% due to statistical variance. Hospital 1, with about 45 births per day, will have a percentage closer to the expected 50% due to the law of large numbers, which reduces variability in larger samples. Therefore, hospital 2 is likely to have more days with atypical percentages of baby boys.
