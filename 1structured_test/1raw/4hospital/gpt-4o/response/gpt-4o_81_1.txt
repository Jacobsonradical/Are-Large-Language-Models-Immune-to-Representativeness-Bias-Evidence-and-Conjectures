{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, which has fewer births per day (about 15), is more likely to experience larger fluctuations in the percentage of boys born on a given day. This is due to the smaller sample size, which is more susceptible to statistical variation. Consequently, Hospital 2 is expected to record more days when the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.
