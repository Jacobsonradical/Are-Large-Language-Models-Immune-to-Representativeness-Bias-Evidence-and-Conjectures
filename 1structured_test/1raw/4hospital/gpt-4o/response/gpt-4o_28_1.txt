To address this question, let's consider the impact of the sample size on variability. Hospital 1 has about 45 births per day, while Hospital 2 has about 15 births per day. Larger sample sizes tend to have less variability because the law of large numbers dictates that the observed average will be closer to the expected average (in this case, 50% boys).

Conversely, smaller sample sizes will have more variability, leading to a higher likelihood of observing extreme values (like more than 60% boys).

Therefore, Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, is more likely to record more days where the percentage of baby boys born exceeds 60%.

Hence, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
