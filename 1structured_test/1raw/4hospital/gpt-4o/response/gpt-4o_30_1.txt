{hospital: 2}

Explanation: The key concept here is the law of large numbers. Hospital 1 has about 45 births per day, while hospital 2 has about 15 births per day. With a smaller sample size in Hospital 2, the percentage of boys (or girls) born each day is more likely to show larger deviations from the mean of 50%. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60% compared to Hospital 1, which has a larger sample size and thus more consistency around the 50% average.
