{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, which has about 15 babies born each day, has a smaller sample size. Smaller sample sizes are more susceptible to variability and deviations from the expected 50% rate. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 2 will experience days where the proportion of boys is significantly higher or lower than 50%. Consequently, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with over 60% of the babies being boys.
