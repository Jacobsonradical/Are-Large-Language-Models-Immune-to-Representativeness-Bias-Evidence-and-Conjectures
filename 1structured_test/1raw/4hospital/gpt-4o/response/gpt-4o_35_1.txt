{hospital: 2}

This conclusion is based on the concept of the "law of large numbers" and the "law of small numbers." Hospital 1 involves a larger sample size (about 45 babies per day), while Hospital 2 involves a smaller sample size (about 15 babies per day). 

With smaller sample sizes, there is more variability (or fluctuation) in percentages. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record days with a higher percentage deviation (i.e., more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys), compared to Hospital 1 where the larger sample size results in a percentage closer to the average (50%).

Hence, Hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys.
