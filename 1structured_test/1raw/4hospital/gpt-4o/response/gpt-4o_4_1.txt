{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, with fewer births per day (about 15), is more likely to experience larger swings in the percentage of baby boys born on any given day due to the smaller sample size. This makes it more likely for Hospital 2 to have a higher number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, compared to Hospital 1 where the sample size is larger and variations tend to average out more.
