{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2 is likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% of the babies being boys. This is because smaller sample sizes (in this case, 15 babies per day in hospital 2) tend to exhibit more variability in percentage terms compared to larger sample sizes (45 babies per day in hospital 1). Hence, the likelihood of experiencing days with a high percentage (such as more than 60%) of boys is higher in hospital 2.
