{hospital: 2}

The reasoning behind this choice is based on the statistical property known as the law of large numbers. In the larger hospital (hospital 1, with about 45 births per day), the percentage of baby boys is likely to be closer to the overall 50% average due to the larger sample size. Conversely, in the smaller hospital (hospital 2, with about 15 births per day), the percentage of baby boys can deviate more from the average, because smaller sample sizes have greater variability. As a result, hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.
