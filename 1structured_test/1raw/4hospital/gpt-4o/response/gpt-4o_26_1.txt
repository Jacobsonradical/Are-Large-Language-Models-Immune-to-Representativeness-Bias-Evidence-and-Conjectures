{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, is more likely to experience greater variability in the percentage of boys born each day. This is due to the law of large numbers which implies that larger sample sizes (like in Hospital 1) tend to be more stable and closer to the expected average (in this case, around 50%). Smaller sample sizes (like in Hospital 2) can lead to more significant fluctuations. Therefore, Hospital 2 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% boys.
