{hospital: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is based on the concept of the Law of Large Numbers and statistical variability. In smaller sample sizes, there is more variation and a higher probability of seeing a more extreme percentage, such as more than 60% of babies being boys. Hospital 2, with only 15 babies born each day, represents a smaller sample size compared to hospital 1, which has 45 babies born each day. Therefore, hospital 2 is likely to record more days where the percentage of baby boys born is more than 60%.
