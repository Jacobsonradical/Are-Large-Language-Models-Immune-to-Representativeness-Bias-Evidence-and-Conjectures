{hospital: 2}

Explanation: The hospital with fewer births per day is likely to experience more variability in the percentage of boys born on any given day. This is due to the law of large numbers, which states that larger sample sizes tend to produce proportions closer to the expected average (50% of babies being boys). In hospital 2, with about 15 babies born each day, the smaller sample size means there is a higher chance of seeing extreme percentages (like more than 60%) than in hospital 1, where about 45 babies are born each day. Therefore, hospital 2 is expected to record more days with more than 60% baby boys.
