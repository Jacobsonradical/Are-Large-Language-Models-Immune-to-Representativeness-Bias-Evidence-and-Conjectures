{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, is more likely to experience larger fluctuations in the percentage of boys born. This is because with a smaller sample size, the variability tends to be higher. As a result, Hospital 2 will likely record more days with an unusually high or low percentage of boys compared to Hospital 1.
