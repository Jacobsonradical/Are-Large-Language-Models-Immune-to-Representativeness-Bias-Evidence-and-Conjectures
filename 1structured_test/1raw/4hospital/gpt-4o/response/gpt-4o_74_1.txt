{hospital: 2}

The reason for this is due to the law of large numbers and statistical variability. Hospital 2, with fewer babies born each day (15), is more likely to see higher variability in the percentage of baby boys compared to Hospital 1, which has a larger number of births (45). Therefore, Hospital 2 would record more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.
