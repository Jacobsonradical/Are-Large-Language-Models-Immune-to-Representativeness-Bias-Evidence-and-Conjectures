{hospital: 2}

Explanation: The likelihood of extreme percentages (such as more than 60% boys) is higher in situations involving smaller sample sizes due to greater statistical variability. Since hospital 2 has fewer births per day (15) compared to hospital 1 (45), it is more likely to experience greater fluctuations in the percentage of boys born on a given day. Therefore, hospital 2 is expected to record more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.
