{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, which has fewer births each day (about 15 babies), is more likely to have a higher percentage variability simply due to the law of small numbers. With a smaller sample size, there is a greater chance for the daily percentage to fluctuate, meaning that Hospital 2 would likely record more days with more than 60% of the babies being boys compared to Hospital 1, which has a larger daily sample size (about 45 babies).
