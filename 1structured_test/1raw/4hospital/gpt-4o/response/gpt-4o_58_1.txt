{hospital: 2}

The number of babies born each day impacts the variability in the percentage of boys. Hospital 2, with fewer births (about 15 per day), will have a higher day-to-day variation in the percentage of boys compared to Hospital 1, which has around 45 births per day. Consequently, Hospital 2 is likely to record more days with a percentage of boys exceeding 60% due to this increased variability.
