{hospital: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer involves understanding the concept of variability in smaller sample sizes. Hospital 2, with approximately 15 births per day, has a smaller sample size compared to Hospital 1, which has about 45 births per day. Smaller sample sizes tend to exhibit greater variability in outcomes, which in this case means greater day-to-day fluctuations in the proportion of baby boys. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60% than Hospital 1.
