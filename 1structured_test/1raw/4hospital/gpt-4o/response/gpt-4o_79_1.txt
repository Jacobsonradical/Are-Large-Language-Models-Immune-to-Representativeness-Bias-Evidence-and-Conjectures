{hospital: 2}

Explanation:
Hospital 2, which has about 15 babies born each day, is more likely to experience higher variability in percentages due to the smaller sample size. With fewer births per day, the percentage of boys can more easily deviate from the expected 50%. This increased variability makes it more likely for Hospital 2 to have more days where over 60% of the babies born are boys compared to Hospital 1, which has a larger number of births (about 45 per day) and thus less variability.
