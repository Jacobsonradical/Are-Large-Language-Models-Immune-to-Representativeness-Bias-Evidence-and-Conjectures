{hospital: 2}

Explanation: Larger sample sizes tend to exhibit less variance in percentages due to the law of large numbers. Since hospital 1 has about 45 births per day and hospital 2 has about 15 births per day, the percentage of boys born in hospital 2 is likely to vary more each day than in hospital 1. As a result, hospital 2 will have more days where the percentage of baby boys born is greater than 60%, purely due to the increased day-to-day variation in smaller sample sizes.
