{hospital: 2}

Explanation: Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with over 60% of babies being boys. This is due to the concept of the law of large numbers, which indicates that larger sample sizes (like in Hospital 1) will have percentages closer to the expected value (50%). Meanwhile, smaller sample sizes (like in Hospital 2) will experience more variability and thus are more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.
