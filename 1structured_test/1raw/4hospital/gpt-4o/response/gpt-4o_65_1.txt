{hospital: 2}

The reason is based on the law of large numbers and variability in smaller versus larger sample sizes. Hospital 2, with a smaller number of births per day (about 15), will exhibit greater day-to-day variability in the percentage of boys born compared to Hospital 1, which has a larger number of births per day (about 45). This greater variability in Hospital 2 makes it more likely to have a higher number of days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%.
