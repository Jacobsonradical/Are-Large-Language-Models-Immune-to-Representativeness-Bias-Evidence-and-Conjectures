{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, with fewer births per day (about 15), is more likely to experience a higher variability in the proportion of boys born on any given day. With fewer births, the probability of having days where more than 60% of the babies are boys increases due to the smaller sample size. Thus, Hospital 2 is likely to record more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
