{hospital: 2}

Explanation:
Hospital 2, where fewer babies are born each day (about 15), is more likely to see greater variability in the percentage of baby boys born on any given day due to the smaller sample size. In statistical terms, this means that there is a higher likelihood that the percentage of baby boys could be greater than 60% (or less than 40%) just by random chance compared to Hospital 1, where the larger number of births (about 45 per day) will tend to average closer to 50% due to the law of large numbers. So, Hospital 2 is expected to record more days when the percentage of baby boys born is greater than 60%.
