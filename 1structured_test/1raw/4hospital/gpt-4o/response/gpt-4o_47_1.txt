{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, which has about 15 babies born each day, is more likely to observe days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%. This is because with a smaller sample size (15 babies), there is greater variability and hence a higher probability of experiencing greater deviations from the expected 50% compared to the larger sample size of 45 babies in hospital 1.
