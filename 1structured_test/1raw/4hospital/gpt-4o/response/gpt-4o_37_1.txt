This problem can be analyzed through the concept of the law of large numbers and statistical variability. The law of large numbers states that as the size of a sample increases, the sample mean will get closer to the population mean. In this case, the population mean is 50% boys.

**Hospital 1** has about 45 babies born each day.
**Hospital 2** has about 15 babies born each day.

Given that the percentage of boys born may vary each day, but on average is centered around 50%, smaller sample sizes (like in Hospital 2) will exhibit greater variability compared to larger sample sizes (like in Hospital 1). This is because smaller samples are more prone to fluctuation and deviation from the mean.

Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 2, with the smaller sample size, will have more days when the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%. 

So, the answer is likely:

{hospital: 2}
