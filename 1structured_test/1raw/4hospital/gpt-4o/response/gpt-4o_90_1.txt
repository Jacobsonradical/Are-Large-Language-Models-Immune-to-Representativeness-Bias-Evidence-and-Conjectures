{hospital: 2}

The key idea here is the concept of the "law of large numbers" which implies that larger sample sizes tend to produce results that are closer to the expected average. Since hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born each day (45 babies compared to 15 in hospital 2), the percentage of boys will fluctuate less around the expected 50%. Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, will see a greater relative fluctuation in the daily percentage of boys born. Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have more days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%.
