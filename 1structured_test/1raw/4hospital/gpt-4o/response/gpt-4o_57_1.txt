{hospital: 2}

Explanation: The smaller sample size in hospital 2 (about 15 babies born each day) means that the proportion of boys can vary more widely from the 50% average on any given day compared to hospital 1 (about 45 babies born each day). Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with an unusually high percentage of baby boys (greater than 60%) due to the greater variability in smaller sample sizes.
