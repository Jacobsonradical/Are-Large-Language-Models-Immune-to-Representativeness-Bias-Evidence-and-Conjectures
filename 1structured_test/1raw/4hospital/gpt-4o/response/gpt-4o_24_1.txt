{hospital: 2}

Explanation: The number of babies born each day in hospital 2 is smaller compared to hospital 1. Due to the smaller sample size, hospital 2 is more likely to experience larger fluctuations in the percentage of boys born on any given day. This is because with fewer births, the daily proportion is more susceptible to variability. Therefore, hospital 2 is expected to record more days with more than 60% of the babies being boys.
