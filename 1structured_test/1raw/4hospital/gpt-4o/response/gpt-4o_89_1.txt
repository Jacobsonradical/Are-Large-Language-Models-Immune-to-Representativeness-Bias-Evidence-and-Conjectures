{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, with a smaller number of births each day, is more likely to have a higher variability in the percentage of boys born on any given day. With only about 15 babies born each day, the chance of having more than 60% of boys on some days is higher due to the smaller sample size and greater impact of random fluctuations. Conversely, hospital 1, which has about 45 births per day, will experience less variability, making it less likely to have more than 60% of boys born on any given day. Therefore, hospital 2 is expected to have recorded more such days.
