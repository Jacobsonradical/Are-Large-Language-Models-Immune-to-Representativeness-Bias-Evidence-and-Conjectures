{hospital: 2}

The reasoning behind this conclusion is based on the law of large numbers and variability. Hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, has a larger sample size compared to Hospital 2, which has about 15 babies born each day. Larger sample sizes tend to have percentages that are closer to the expected value of 50%, leading to less variability in the daily percentage of boys born. Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, will have more variability in the percentage of boys born each day, leading to a higher likelihood of recording days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys.

Thus, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys due to the greater variability in smaller samples.
