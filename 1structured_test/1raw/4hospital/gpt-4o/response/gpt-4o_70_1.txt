Given the scenario, it's essential to consider the concept of variability and sample size in randomness. Hospital 1 has about 45 births per day, while Hospital 2 has about 15 births per day. 

The variability (or standard deviation) in the percentage of baby boys born on any given day will be higher in the smaller sample size (Hospital 2) compared to the larger sample size (Hospital 1). This is because smaller samples tend to show more fluctuation from the expected 50% compared to larger samples.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where the percentage of boys is significantly different from the expected 50%, due to its smaller sample size.
