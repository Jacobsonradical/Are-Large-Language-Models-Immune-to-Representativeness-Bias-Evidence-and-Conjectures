{hospital: 2}

In statistics, smaller sample sizes tend to show more variation. Since hospital 2 has fewer births per day (about 15) compared to hospital 1 (about 45), the daily proportion of baby boys in hospital 2 will have greater fluctuations. This means hospital 2 is more likely to record days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.
