{hospital: 2}

Explanation: 

The variability (or volatility) in the percentage of boys born each day will have a larger impact on smaller sample sizes. Because hospital 2 has a smaller sample size (15 babies per day) compared to hospital 1 (45 babies per day), it is more likely to experience days where the percentage of boys born deviates more significantly from the 50% average. 

Thus, hospital 2 is expected to record more days with over 60% boys born, whereas the larger sample size in hospital 1 will have a more stable percentage closer to the average 50%.
