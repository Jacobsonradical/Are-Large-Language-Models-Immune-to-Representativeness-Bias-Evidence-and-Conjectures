{hospital: 2}

The reason Hospital 2 is expected to record more days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys is due to the Law of Large Numbers. Hospital 1, which has a larger sample size of approximately 45 babies born each day, will have less variability in the percentage of boys born each day compared to Hospital 2, which has a smaller sample size of about 15 babies born each day. Smaller sample sizes tend to exhibit greater variability, so Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from the mean of 50%, including more days where the percentage exceeds 60%.
