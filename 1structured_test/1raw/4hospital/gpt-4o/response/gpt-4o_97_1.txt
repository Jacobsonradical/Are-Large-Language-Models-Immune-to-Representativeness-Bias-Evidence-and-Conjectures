To determine which hospital recorded more days with more than 60% of the babies being boys, we need to look at the concept of variability and sample size.

Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (about 45 babies born each day) compared to Hospital 2 (about 15 babies born each day). Larger sample sizes tend to average out to the expected mean (in this case, 50% boys) due to the Law of Large Numbers, leading to lower variability.

Conversely, smaller sample sizes have higher variability. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to experience a greater proportion of days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from the mean, including days with more than 60% boys.

Given this understanding, it is more likely that Hospital 2 recorded more such days.
