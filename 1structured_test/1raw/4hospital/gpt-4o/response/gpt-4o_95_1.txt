{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, would likely see a greater deviation from the expected 50% gender ratio due to the smaller sample size. This means that it is statistically more likely for Hospital 2 to have more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60% compared to Hospital 1. This phenomenon is an example of the law of small numbers, where smaller sample sizes are more susceptible to larger fluctuations.
