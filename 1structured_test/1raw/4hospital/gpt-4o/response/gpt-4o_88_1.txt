{hospital: 2}

This is based on the concept of sample size and variability. Hospital 2, which has a smaller number of births per day (15), is more likely to experience higher variability in the percentage of boys born on any given day compared to Hospital 1, which has a larger sample size (45). Larger samples tend to have percentages closer to the expected mean (50%), while smaller samples can have more extreme variations. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have more days where the percentage of boys born is greater than 60%.
