{hospital: 2}

In this scenario, we are considering the Law of Large Numbers, which states that as the size of the sample increases, the sample mean will get closer to the population mean. Hospital 1, with 45 babies born each day, has a larger sample size compared to Hospital 2, which has 15 babies born each day. This larger sample size will more consistently reflect the true population mean of baby boys being around 50%, leading to less variability in the percentage.

Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size of 15 babies born each day, will experience more variability and thus have a higher probability of recording days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with over 60% baby boys.
