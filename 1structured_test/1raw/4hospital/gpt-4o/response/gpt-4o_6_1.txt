To determine which hospital recorded more days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys, we need to consider the law of large numbers and the variability that comes with smaller sample sizes.

Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day. Because larger sample sizes tend to be closer to the expected proportion (50% boys, 50% girls), Hospital 1 with 45 births per day will have less day-to-day variability in the percentage of boys than Hospital 2, which has only 15 births per day. 

This means that Hospital 2 is more likely to experience days where the percentage of boys is significantly higher or lower than the expected 50%. Hospital 1, with its larger number of births, will see less variability and thus fewer days with extreme percentages.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is expected to record more such days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to the higher variability from the smaller sample size.
