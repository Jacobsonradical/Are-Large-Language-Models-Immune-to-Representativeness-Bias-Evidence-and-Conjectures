{hospital: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is based on the concept of sample size and variability. Hospital 2, with fewer births per day (about 15), is more likely to see larger day-to-day variations in the percentage of boys born due to the smaller sample size. In contrast, Hospital 1, with about 45 births per day, will have its daily percentages closer to the overall average (about 50%) due to the larger sample size, which reduces variability. Consequently, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.
