{hospital: 2}

Explanation: This is a problem related to the law of large numbers in probability theory. In the smaller hospital (hospital 2), with only 15 births per day, there's more variability and thus a higher likelihood of having days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from the average 50%. In the larger hospital (hospital 1), with 45 births per day, the percentages are more likely to be closer to the average due to the larger sample size. Therefore, hospital 2 would record more days with more than 60% boys.
