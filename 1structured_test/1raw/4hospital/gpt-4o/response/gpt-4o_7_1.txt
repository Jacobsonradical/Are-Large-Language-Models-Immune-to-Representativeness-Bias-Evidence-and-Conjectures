{hospital: 2}

Explanation: 
Due to the law of large numbers, larger sample sizes tend to have proportions that are closer to the expected percentage (in this case, 50%). Hospital 1, with about 45 babies born each day, will have proportions of boys and girls that are closer to 50% compared to Hospital 2, which only has about 15 babies born each day. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days when the percentage of boys deviates significantly from the expected 50%, leading to more days where the proportion of boys is greater than 60%. Hence, Hospital 2 is expected to record more such days.
