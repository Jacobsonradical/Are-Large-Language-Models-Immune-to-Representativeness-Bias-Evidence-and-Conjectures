{hospital: 2}

This is because the smaller the sample size, the greater the variability is likely to be. Since hospital 2 has only about 15 babies born each day, the proportion of days where more than 60% of the babies are boys is likely to be higher compared to hospital 1, which has about 45 babies born each day. With a larger sample size, the proportion of boys and girls born each day will tend to be closer to the overall average of 50%, whereas in a smaller sample size, the proportion can more easily swing above or below 60%. Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% of the babies being boys.
