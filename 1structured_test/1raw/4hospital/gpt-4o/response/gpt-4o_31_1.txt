{hospital: 2}

Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% of the babies being boys due to the law of large numbers. Since hospital 1 has a larger sample size (about 45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (about 15 babies), the proportion of boys born each day at hospital 1 is more likely to be closer to the expected average of 50%. In contrast, the smaller sample size at hospital 2 means there is more variability, making it more likely that hospital 2 will have more days where the proportion of boys is significantly higher or lower than 50%.
