{hospital: 2}

Explanation: Hospital 2, which has fewer births each day (about 15 babies), is more likely to experience greater variability in the percentage of boys born each day due to the smaller sample size. Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% of the babies born being boys. This is a result of the law of small numbers, where smaller sample sizes are more susceptible to greater statistical fluctuations.
