{hospital: 2}

Explanation: This question relates to the concept of a smaller sample size exhibiting more variability. In statistical terms, smaller sample sizes are more likely to deviate from the expected mean, in this case, 50% of babies being boys. Consequently, with only about 15 babies born each day in hospital 2, the likelihood of experiencing days with more than 60% boys is higher than in hospital 1, which has about 45 births per day. Hence, hospital 2 is expected to record more days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%.
