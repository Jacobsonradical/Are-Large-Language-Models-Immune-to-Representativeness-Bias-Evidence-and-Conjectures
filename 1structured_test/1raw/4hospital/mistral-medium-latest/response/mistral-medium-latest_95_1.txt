{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2. With approximately 45 babies born daily in hospital 1 and 15 in hospital 2, there are more opportunities for hospital 1 to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to random variation. This assumption is based on the same probability of having over 60% baby boys applying to both hospitals.
