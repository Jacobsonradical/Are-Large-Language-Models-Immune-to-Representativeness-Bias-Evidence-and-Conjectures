{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2. With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme values, such as more than 60% of the babies born being boys on a particular day. This concept is related to the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem in statistics.
