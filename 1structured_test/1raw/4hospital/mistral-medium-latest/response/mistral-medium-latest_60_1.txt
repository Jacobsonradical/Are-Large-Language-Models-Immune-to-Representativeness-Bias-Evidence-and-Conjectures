{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days. Since hospital 1 has a larger number of births each day (45 compared to 15 in hospital 2), there is a higher probability that on any given day, more than 60% of the babies born will be boys. This is due to the law of large numbers, which states that as the number of trials (in this case, births) increases, the average of the results obtained from all the trials should get closer to the expected value. However, this also means that there will be more variation in the percentage of boys born in hospital 1, increasing the chance of having days with more than 60% boys. In contrast, hospital 2 has fewer births each day, so the percentage of boys born is less likely to deviate significantly from the expected value of 50%, making it less likely that they will have a large number of days with more than 60% boys.
