{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born, simply due to the larger sample size of births per day compared to Hospital 2. With approximately 45 babies born each day, there is a higher chance of having more days where more than 60% of those babies are boys, as it takes fewer boys (relative to the total number of births) on any given day to exceed the 60% threshold. In contrast, Hospital 2 has only about 15 births per day, so it would require a larger proportion of those births to be boys in order to meet the 60% threshold. This makes it less likely for Hospital 2 to have as many days with over 60% baby boys born compared to Hospital 1.
