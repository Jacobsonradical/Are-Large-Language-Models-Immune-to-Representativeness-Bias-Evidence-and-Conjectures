{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2, which means that there is a greater chance of having a higher percentage of baby boys on any given day due to random variation. This is a statistical concept known as the law of large numbers, which states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean will tend to approach the population mean. In this case, the population mean is 50% baby boys, so a larger sample size will be less likely to deviate significantly from this mean. Therefore, hospital 1, with its larger sample size, is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, but when it does happen, it is more likely to be recorded because there are more babies born each day. Conversely, hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to random variation, but these days are less likely to be recorded because there are fewer babies born each day. Over the course of a year, hospital 1 is therefore likely to have recorded more such days than hospital 2.
