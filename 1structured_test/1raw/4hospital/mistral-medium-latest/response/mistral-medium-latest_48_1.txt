{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size (around 45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, it is more likely that there will be days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to random variation. This is because the larger sample size makes it more likely that an extreme value (in this case, a high percentage of boys) will occur by chance.

On the other hand, hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, which means that there is less variability in the percentage of boys born each day. This makes it less likely that there will be days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, as the smaller sample size makes it more difficult for extreme values to occur by chance.

Therefore, it is likely that hospital 1 recorded more such days than hospital 2.
