{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days. This is because the more babies born in a day, the less likely it is that more than 60% of them are boys due to natural variability. Since Hospital 1 has a larger number of births each day compared to Hospital 2, it would take a more extreme skew in the births of boys to exceed the 60% threshold, making it more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more days when more than 60% of the babies born were boys. However, this assumes that the natural variability in the percentages of baby boys born in each hospital is similar. If the natural variability were significantly higher in Hospital 1, this conclusion might not hold. Without more information, it is impossible to be certain, but based on the information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that Hospital 1 likely recorded more days when more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
