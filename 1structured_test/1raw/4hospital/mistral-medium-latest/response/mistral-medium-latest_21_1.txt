{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys because it has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 in hospital 2). A higher number of daily births increases the chance of observing more days with an unusually high percentage of baby boys. However, please note that this is a statistical probability and not a certainty.
