{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in hospital 2). A larger sample size makes it more likely that there will be days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to random variation. This is a statistical concept known as the law of large numbers. While it is possible that both hospitals could have recorded a similar number of days with more than 60% baby boys, it is more likely that hospital 1 would have recorded more such days due to the larger sample size.
