{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, it is statistically more likely that there will be more days where the percentage of boys is above the average of 50%.

This is due to the concept of statistical variance. A smaller sample size will have a larger variance, meaning that the percentage of boys born each day is more likely to deviate from the average of 50%. Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have days where over 60% of the babies born are boys, simply due to chance.

However, because hospital 1 has a larger sample size, it will have more days overall where the percentage of boys is above 60%, even if the likelihood of any given day having over 60% boys is lower than in hospital 2. This is why I believe that hospital 1 recorded more such days.
