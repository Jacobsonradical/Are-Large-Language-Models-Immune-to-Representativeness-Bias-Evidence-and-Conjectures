{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 births per day). With a larger sample size, it's statistically more likely that there will be days where the percentage of boys is significantly higher than the overall average of 50%.
