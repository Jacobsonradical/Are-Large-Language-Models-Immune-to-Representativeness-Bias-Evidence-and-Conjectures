{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in hospital 1 (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions of boys being born on any given day, including days with over 60% boys. This concept is related to the law of large numbers, which states that as the sample size increases, the sample proportion tends to get closer to the true population proportion. However, it also means that the variability in the sample proportion decreases more slowly for larger sample sizes, making it more likely to observe extreme proportions. In this case, the larger sample size in hospital 1 increases the likelihood of observing days with over 60% boys, even though the overall proportion of boys is the same in both hospitals.
