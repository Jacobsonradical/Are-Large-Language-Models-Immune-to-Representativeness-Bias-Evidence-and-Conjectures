{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in hospital 1 (45 compared to 15 in hospital 2). With a larger sample, it is statistically more likely that there will be days where the percentage of boys is significantly higher than the overall average of 50%. In contrast, with a smaller sample size, the percentage of boys born each day is less likely to deviate as much from the average. Therefore, hospital 1 would have a higher chance of recording days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
