{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 would likely have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because they have a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day at hospital 2). With a larger sample size, there is more variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day, making it more likely that some days will have over 60% baby boys. This concept is known as the law of large numbers. While it's possible that both hospitals could have a similar number of days with over 60% baby boys, it's more likely that hospital 1 would have more such days given their larger sample size.
