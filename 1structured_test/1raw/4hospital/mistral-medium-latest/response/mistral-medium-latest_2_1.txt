{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 recorded more such days.

Here's the reasoning:

Since Hospital 1 has a larger number of births per day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15), there is a higher probability that on any given day, more than 60% of the babies born will be boys. This is due to the larger sample size of births in Hospital 1, which makes it more likely for statistical fluctuations to result in days with a higher percentage of baby boys.

Even though the overall percentage of baby boys is about 50% for both hospitals, the larger daily volume of births in Hospital 1 increases the chances of having more days with over 60% baby boys. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Hospital 1 recorded more such days compared to Hospital 2.
