{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, there is a higher probability of observing more extreme proportions of baby boys born on any given day, both above and below 50%. However, the question asks for days where the proportion of baby boys is above 60%, so the larger variance associated with a larger sample size in hospital 1 will result in more days meeting this criterion.

It's important to note that this answer assumes that the daily proportions of baby boys are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across days in both hospitals. If this assumption is violated, then the answer could be different. However, based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to make this assumption.
