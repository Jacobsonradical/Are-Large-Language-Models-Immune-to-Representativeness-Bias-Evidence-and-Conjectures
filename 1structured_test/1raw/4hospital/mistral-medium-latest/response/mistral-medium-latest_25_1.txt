{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day). With a larger sample size, there is a higher probability of observing more extreme proportions, such as over 60% baby boys being born on a given day. This concept is related to the law of large numbers and the concept of statistical variability.
