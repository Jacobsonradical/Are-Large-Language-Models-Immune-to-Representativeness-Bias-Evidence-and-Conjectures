{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys due to the larger sample size of births each day. The higher the number of births, the more likely it is that an abnormally high percentage of boys will be born on a particular day due to statistical variance. This is known as the law of large numbers, which states that as the sample size increases, the sample results are likely to be closer to the true population mean (in this case, the true population mean is 50% baby boys). Conversely, Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is less likely to have as many days with an abnormally high percentage of baby boys. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
