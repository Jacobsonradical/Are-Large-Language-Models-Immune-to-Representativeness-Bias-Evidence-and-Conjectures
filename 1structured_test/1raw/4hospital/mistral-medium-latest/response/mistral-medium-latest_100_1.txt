{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because they have a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in hospital 2). A larger sample size means that there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions, such as over 60% boys, simply due to random variation. In other words, even though the overall percentage of baby boys is the same for both hospitals, the larger daily number of births in hospital 1 increases the likelihood of having days with an unusually high proportion of boys.
