{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 births per day). With a larger sample size, there is a higher probability of observing more extreme values, such as over 60% baby boys, due to random variation. In contrast, hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is less likely to observe such extreme values as frequently. Therefore, hospital 1 is expected to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born compared to hospital 2.
