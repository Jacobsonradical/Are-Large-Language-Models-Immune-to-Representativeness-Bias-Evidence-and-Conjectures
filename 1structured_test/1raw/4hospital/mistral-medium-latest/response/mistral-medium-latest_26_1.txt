{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 would likely have recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, there is a greater chance of observing more extreme percentages of baby boys born on any given day, including days with over 60% baby boys. This concept is related to the law of large numbers and statistical variability.

However, it's important to note that this answer is based on probability and is not a guarantee, as the exact number of days with over 60% baby boys in each hospital would depend on the specific daily birth data. But based on the information provided, it is more likely that hospital 1 recorded more such days.
