{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the higher volume of babies born each day in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2. With a larger sample size (45 babies per day vs. 15 babies per day), there is a greater chance of observing more extreme proportions of baby boys born on any given day. This includes days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. This likelihood increases over a longer period, such as one year.
