{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 would likely have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies/day compared to 15 babies/day in hospital 2). With more births each day, there is a higher chance of observing an anomalous day with more than 60% baby boys. This is due to the statistical concept of variation and sample size. In smaller samples, extreme values are more likely to occur simply by chance. Therefore, hospital 1, with its larger sample size, would have a lower probability of having over 60% baby boys on any given day, but because they have more births, they would be expected to observe this phenomenon more frequently than hospital 2.
