{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born. This is because it has a larger sample size (45 babies/day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies/day). A larger sample size means that there are more opportunities for an unusually high proportion of baby boys to be born on any given day. This is due to the statistical concept of variance, which is higher for smaller sample sizes. Therefore, hospital 1 would have a higher chance of observing days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.
