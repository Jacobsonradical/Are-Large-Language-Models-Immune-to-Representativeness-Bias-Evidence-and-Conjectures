{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. Here's my reasoning:

1. Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day).
2. With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing extreme values (in this case, more than 60% baby boys) due to natural variation.
3. Even though the overall percentage of baby boys is about 50%, the daily percentage can vary. The larger the sample size, the higher the chance of observing a day with more than 60% baby boys.
4. Therefore, I believe hospital 1, with its larger sample size, would have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
