{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 would have more days with over 60% of the babies born being boys than Hospital 2. This is because Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of births each day (45 compared to 15), meaning that there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions of boys born on any given day. This includes both higher and lower percentages of boys, but since we are only concerned with days where more than 60% of babies born are boys, the larger sample size of Hospital 1 increases the likelihood of observing such days. Therefore, Hospital 1 is likely to record more days with over 60% of the babies born being boys.
