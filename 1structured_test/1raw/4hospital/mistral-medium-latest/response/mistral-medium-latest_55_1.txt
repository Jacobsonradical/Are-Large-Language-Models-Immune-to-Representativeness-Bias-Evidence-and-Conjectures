{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2 (45 vs 15). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions of boys born on any given day, including days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. This concept is related to the law of large numbers and statistical variability. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Hospital 1 would have recorded more such days.
