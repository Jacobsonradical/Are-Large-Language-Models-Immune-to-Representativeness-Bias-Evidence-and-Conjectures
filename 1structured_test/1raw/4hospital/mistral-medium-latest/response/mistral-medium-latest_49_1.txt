{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1, which has a larger number of births per day (45 compared to 15 in hospital 2), is more likely to have a higher number of days with over 60% baby boys born. This is due to the statistical concept of regression to the mean: with a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys will tend to be closer to the overall average of 50%, making days with over 60% baby boys less frequent. Conversely, hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, will have more fluctuation around the average, leading to a higher number of days with over 60% baby boys.

However, without specific data on the daily variation in the percentage of baby boys, this answer is based on statistical reasoning and not on concrete evidence. Please note that this is an educated guess based on probability and statistical concepts.
