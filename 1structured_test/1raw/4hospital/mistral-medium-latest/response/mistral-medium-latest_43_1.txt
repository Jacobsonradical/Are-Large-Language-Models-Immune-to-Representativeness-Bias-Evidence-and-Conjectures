{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 would likely record more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 compared to 15 for hospital 2). With a larger sample size, the percentage of baby boys born on a given day is more likely to deviate significantly from the overall average of 50%, both above and below that average. In this case, we're interested in days where the percentage of baby boys is significantly above the average, so a larger sample size makes that more likely to happen.

However, it's worth noting that this is not guaranteed to be the case, and it's possible that hospital 2 could still have more such days if there are other factors at play that affect the gender distribution of babies born in that hospital. But based solely on the information provided, it seems more likely that hospital 1 would have more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
