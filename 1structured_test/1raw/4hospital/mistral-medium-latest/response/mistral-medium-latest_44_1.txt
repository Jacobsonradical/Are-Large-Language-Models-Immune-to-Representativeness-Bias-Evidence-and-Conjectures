{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in hospital 1 (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size means that there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions, such as over 60% baby boys, even though the overall percentage of baby boys is the same for both hospitals.
