{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in hospital 1 compared to hospital 2. With approximately 45 babies born daily, hospital 1 has a higher chance of observing more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys due to statistical variation. In contrast, hospital 2, with only about 15 babies born each day, will have a lower chance of observing such days. This difference in sample size increases the likelihood that hospital 1 will have more days with over 60% baby boys.
