{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because it has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 compared to 15 in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, it is more likely that there will be days where the percentage of baby boys is higher than 60%, due to the effects of random variation. While it is still possible that hospital 2 could have had more such days, it is less likely based on the available information.
