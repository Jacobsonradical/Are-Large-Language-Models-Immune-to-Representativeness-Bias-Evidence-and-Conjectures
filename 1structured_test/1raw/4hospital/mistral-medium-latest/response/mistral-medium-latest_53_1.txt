{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day compared to 15 babies per day in hospital 2), which makes it more likely that there will be more days where the percentage of baby boys is above 60%. This is due to the laws of probability: with a larger sample size, there is a greater chance of observing extreme values, both high and low. In this case, we are interested in the high end of the percentage of baby boys. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that hospital 1 would have recorded more such days.
