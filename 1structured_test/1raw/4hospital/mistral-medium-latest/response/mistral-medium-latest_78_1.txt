{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days. Because hospital 1 has a larger number of births each day (45 compared to hospital 2's 15), it will have a higher statistical variability in the percentage of baby boys born. This means that it is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. In contrast, hospital 2 has fewer births each day, so its percentage of baby boys born will be more stable and less likely to exceed 60%.
