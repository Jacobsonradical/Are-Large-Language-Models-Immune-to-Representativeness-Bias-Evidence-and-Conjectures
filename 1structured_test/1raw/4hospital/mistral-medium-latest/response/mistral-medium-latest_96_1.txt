{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in hospital 1. With approximately 45 babies born daily, there is a higher chance of having a day with more than 60% baby boys than in hospital 2, which has around 15 babies born daily. The larger sample size increases the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day, making it more likely to occasionally exceed the 60% threshold.
