{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. Here's why:

1. Hospital 1 has a larger sample size: With around 45 births per day compared to around 15 births per day in hospital 2, hospital 1 will have more opportunities for days with more than 60% baby boys.
2. Larger sample size leads to more variability: With more births each day, there is a higher chance of having days where the percentage of baby boys is above 60%. Conversely, hospital 2, with fewer births per day, will have less variability in the percentage of baby boys born daily.

Overall, due to the larger sample size and higher variability in the percentage of baby boys born daily, hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys.
