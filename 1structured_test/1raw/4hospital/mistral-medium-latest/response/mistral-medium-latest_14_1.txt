{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days. Since there are more babies born in hospital 1 each day (45 compared to 15 in hospital 2), there is a higher chance of having a day where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to the larger sample size. This is because the variability in the percentage of baby boys born is higher in a smaller sample size (hospital 2), making it less likely to have a day where more than 60% of the babies are boys.
