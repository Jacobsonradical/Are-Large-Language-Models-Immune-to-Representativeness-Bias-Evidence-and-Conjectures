{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days. This is because it has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions of baby boys, such as over 60%, due to random variation. This effect is known as statistical volatility. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that hospital 1 would have had more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
