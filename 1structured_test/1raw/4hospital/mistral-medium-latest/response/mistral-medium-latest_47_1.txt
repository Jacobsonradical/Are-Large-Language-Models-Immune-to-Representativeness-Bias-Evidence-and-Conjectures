{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). With a larger sample size, there is a greater chance of having more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to statistical variability. This is because the percentage of baby boys born on any given day is not fixed and can vary from day to day. Therefore, having a larger sample size increases the likelihood of observing days with an unusually high percentage of baby boys. Additionally, since the overall percentage of baby boys is around 50%, having a larger sample size also increases the chance of observing days with a higher percentage of baby boys due to random fluctuations. Overall, these factors suggest that hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys than hospital 2.
