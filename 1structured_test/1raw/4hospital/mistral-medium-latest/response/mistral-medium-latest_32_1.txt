{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the larger number of babies born each day in hospital 1 (45 compared to 15 in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, there is a higher likelihood of observing more extreme variations in the percentage of baby boys born, including days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. This concept is related to statistical variability and the law of large numbers.
