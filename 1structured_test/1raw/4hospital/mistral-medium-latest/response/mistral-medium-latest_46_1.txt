{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). With a larger sample size, hospital 1 is more likely to observe days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to statistical variability. This is because as the sample size increases, the sample proportion of boys born is more likely to be closer to the true population proportion (50%). However, with a smaller sample size, hospital 2 is more likely to observe larger deviations from the true population proportion, including days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. Therefore, hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days than hospital 2.
