{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, it is statistically more likely to see more extreme variations in the percentage of baby boys born on any given day. Therefore, hospital 1 would have a higher probability of having days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
