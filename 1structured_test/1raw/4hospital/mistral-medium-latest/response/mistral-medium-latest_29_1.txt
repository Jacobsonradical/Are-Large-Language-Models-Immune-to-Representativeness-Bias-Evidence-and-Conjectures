{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys being born. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in hospital 1 (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). With a larger sample size, there is a higher probability of observing more extreme percentages of baby boys born on a given day, such as over 60%. This concept is related to statistical variability and the law of large numbers.

It's important to note that this answer is based on probability and the nature of statistical variance, and it does not guarantee that hospital 1 will have recorded more such days in reality. However, based on the information provided, it is the most likely outcome.
