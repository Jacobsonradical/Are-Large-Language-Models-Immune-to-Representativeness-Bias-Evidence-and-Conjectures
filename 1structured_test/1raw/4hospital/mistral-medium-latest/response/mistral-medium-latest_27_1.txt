{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 compared to 15 in hospital 2), which means that there is a greater chance of having an unusually high percentage of baby boys on any given day. This is due to the statistical concept of sampling variability, which states that larger samples are more likely to be representative of the population and less likely to deviate from the expected percentage (in this case, 50% baby boys). Therefore, hospital 1 is likely to have had more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys, simply because of the larger sample size.

Note: This answer assumes that the daily percentage of baby boys is independent and identically distributed across days and hospitals, and that there is no systematic difference between the hospitals in terms of the percentage of baby boys born. If these assumptions are not met, then the answer may be different.
