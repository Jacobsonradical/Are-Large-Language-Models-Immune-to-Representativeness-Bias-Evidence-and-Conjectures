{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size (45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 births per day). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions, such as more than 60% baby boys being born on a given day. This is due to the inherent variability in the proportion of baby boys born each day, which can sometimes be higher or lower than the overall average of 50%. Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys than hospital 2.
