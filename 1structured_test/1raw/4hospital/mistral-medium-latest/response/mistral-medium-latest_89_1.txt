{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of babies born were boys. Since hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2, the probability of observing extreme proportions (in this case, over 60% baby boys) is higher in hospital 1 due to statistical variation. This concept is related to the law of large numbers, which states that as the sample size increases, the sample proportions tend to become more stable and converge to the true population proportion. In this case, the smaller sample size of hospital 2 makes it less likely to observe extreme proportions of baby boys.
