{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day compared to 15 in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, it is more likely that there will be days where the percentage of baby boys is significantly higher than the overall average of 50%. In contrast, hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, which makes it less likely that there will be days where the percentage of baby boys is significantly higher than the overall average.

However, it's worth noting that this is just a statistical likelihood, and it's possible that hospital 2 could still have had more such days due to random variation. But based on the information given, it's more likely that hospital 1 recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
