{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born in Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2. With about 45 births per day in Hospital 1, there is a higher chance of observing days with more than 60% baby boys, as it is easier for the percentage to fluctuate above the threshold with a larger sample size. In contrast, Hospital 2, with only about 15 births per day, has a smaller sample size, making it less likely to observe days with more than 60% baby boys.
