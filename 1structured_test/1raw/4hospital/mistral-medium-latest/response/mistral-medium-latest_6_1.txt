{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in hospital 1 (45 versus 15 in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions of baby boys on any given day. This is a statistical phenomenon known as sampling variability. Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to have more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
