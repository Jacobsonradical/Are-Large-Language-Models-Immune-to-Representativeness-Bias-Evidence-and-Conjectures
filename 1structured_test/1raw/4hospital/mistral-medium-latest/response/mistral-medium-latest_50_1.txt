{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2. With approximately 45 babies born each day in hospital 1, there is a higher chance that a random fluctuation in the percentage of baby boys will result in more than 60% of babies born being boys on a given day. In contrast, hospital 2 has only about 15 babies born each day, which means that the percentage of baby boys is less likely to fluctuate as much as in hospital 1. Therefore, it is less likely that hospital 2 will have as many days on which more than 60% of the babies born are boys.
