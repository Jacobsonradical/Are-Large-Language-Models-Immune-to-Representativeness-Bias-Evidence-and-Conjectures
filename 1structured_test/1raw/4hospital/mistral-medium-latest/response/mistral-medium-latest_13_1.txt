{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in Hospital 1 (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme values, such as over 60% of baby boys being born on a particular day. This concept is rooted in statistical variation and the law of large numbers.
