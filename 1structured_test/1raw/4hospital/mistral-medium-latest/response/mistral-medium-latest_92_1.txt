{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 births per day). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions, such as more than 60% of the babies being boys on a given day. This concept is related to the law of large numbers and the concept of statistical variability.
