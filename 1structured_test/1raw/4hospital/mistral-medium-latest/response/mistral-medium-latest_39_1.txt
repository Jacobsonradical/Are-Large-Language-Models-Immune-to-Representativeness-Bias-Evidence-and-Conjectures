{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 births per day). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions of boys on any given day, such as over 60%, due to random variation. This concept is related to the law of large numbers and the concept of statistical variance. Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 1 recorded more days with over 60% baby boys than hospital 2 did.
