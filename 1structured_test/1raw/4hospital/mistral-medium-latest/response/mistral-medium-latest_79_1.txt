{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% of the babies born being boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day instead of 15 at hospital 2), so it's more likely to see extreme values due to random chance. In other words, hospital 1 has a higher probability of observing days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.
