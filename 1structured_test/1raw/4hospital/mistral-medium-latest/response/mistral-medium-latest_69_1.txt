{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 would likely record more such days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in hospital 1 (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies). With a larger sample size, there is a higher probability of observing more extreme proportions of baby boys, including days where over 60% of the babies born are boys. This concept is related to the law of large numbers and the concept of statistical variance. In general, larger samples are more likely to have proportions closer to the expected value (in this case, 50%), but they are also more likely to occasionally have more extreme proportions compared to smaller samples. Therefore, hospital 1 would likely have more days where over 60% of the babies born are boys.
