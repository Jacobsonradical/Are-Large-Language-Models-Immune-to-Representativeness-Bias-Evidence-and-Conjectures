{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 would likely have recorded more days with over 60% of babies born being boys. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in hospital 1 (45 compared to 15 in hospital 2). A larger sample size means that there is a higher probability of observing more extreme percentages of baby boys born on any given day, including days with over 60% baby boys. This is a result of statistical variation. Therefore, hospital 1 would have a higher chance of recording more such days than hospital 2.
