{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day at hospital 1 (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to vary more widely from the overall average of 50%. This means that there are more opportunities for hospital 1 to have days where over 60% of the babies born are boys. In contrast, hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, so the daily percentage of baby boys is likely to be more consistent and less likely to exceed 60%.
