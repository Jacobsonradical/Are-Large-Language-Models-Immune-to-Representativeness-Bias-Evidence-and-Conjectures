{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size of babies born each day. With 45 babies being born daily, there is a higher chance that on any given day, more than 60% of them will be boys due to natural variation. In contrast, Hospital 2, with only 15 babies born daily, has a smaller sample size and therefore a lower probability of having more than 60% of babies born as boys on any given day.

While the exact number of days cannot be determined without specific data, the difference in sample sizes makes it more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
