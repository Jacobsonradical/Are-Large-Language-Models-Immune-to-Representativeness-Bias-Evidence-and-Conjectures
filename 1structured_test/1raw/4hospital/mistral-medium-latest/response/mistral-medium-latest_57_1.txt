{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days. This is because hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born each day (45 compared to 15 in hospital 2). Therefore, there is a higher chance of having more than 60% of the babies born on a particular day being boys due to statistical variation. This is known as the law of large numbers, which states that as the number of trials increases, the average of the results obtained from all the trials should get closer to the expected value. In this case, the expected value is 50% boys. However, with a smaller sample size (as in hospital 2), the actual percentage of boys born each day is more likely to deviate from the expected value, making it less likely to have more than 60% boys born on a particular day.
