{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to hospital 2's 15 births per day). With a larger sample size, it is less likely that the percentage of boys born on any given day will deviate significantly from the overall average of 50%. However, with a smaller sample size, it is more likely that the percentage of boys born on any given day will deviate significantly from the overall average. Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have days on which more than 60% of the babies born are boys, simply due to the larger variability in the smaller sample size.

However, it's important to note that this is not a certainty, and the actual number of days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys will depend on the specific distribution of births at each hospital. Without more information, it is impossible to say for sure which hospital recorded more such days. But based on the information given, it is more likely that hospital 1 recorded more such days.
