{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size of births each day (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies). A larger sample size means that there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions, such as more than 60% of baby boys being born on a particular day. This is due to the nature of statistical variation, where larger samples are more likely to produce outcomes that are further from the expected value (in this case, 50% baby boys). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that hospital 1 would have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys compared to hospital 2.
