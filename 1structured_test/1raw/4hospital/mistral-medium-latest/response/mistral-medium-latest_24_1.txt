{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size (45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 births per day). With a larger sample size, there is a higher probability of observing days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to random variation. Even though the overall percentage of baby boys is 50%, having more births per day increases the chances of seeing extreme values on certain days. Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys.
