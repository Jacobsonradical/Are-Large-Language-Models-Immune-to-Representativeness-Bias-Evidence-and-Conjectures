{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day), making it statistically more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys due to random variation. This assumes that the percentage of baby boys being born at each hospital is roughly the same, which is suggested by the statement that 50% of all babies are boys, with variation from day to day.
