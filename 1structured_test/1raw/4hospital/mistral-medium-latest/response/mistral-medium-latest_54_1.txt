{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in Hospital 2). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions, such as over 60% boys in a given day. This concept is related to the law of large numbers and statistical variation.

However, it's important to note that this answer is based on probability and the actual outcome may vary. Nonetheless, given the information provided, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more such days.
