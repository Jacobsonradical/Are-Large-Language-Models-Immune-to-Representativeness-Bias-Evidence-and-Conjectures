{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys compared to hospital 2. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 vs. 15), so there is a greater chance of having more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%. This is due to the statistical concept of variability, where larger sample sizes tend to have more stable and predictable results, while smaller sample sizes are more prone to fluctuations and outliers. In this case, hospital 2's smaller sample size makes it more likely to have a higher percentage of baby boys on any given day, simply due to random chance. However, since these occurrences are relatively rare (fewer than 50% of days), hospital 1's larger sample size means it will have more of these days overall.
