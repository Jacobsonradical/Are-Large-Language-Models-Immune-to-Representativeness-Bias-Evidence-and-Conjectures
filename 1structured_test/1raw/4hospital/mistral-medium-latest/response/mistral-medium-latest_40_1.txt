{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2. With approximately 45 babies being born each day in hospital 1, there is a higher probability of having days with more than 60% baby boys than in hospital 2, which has around 15 babies born each day. This is due to the statistical concept of variance, where larger samples are less likely to deviate significantly from the expected value (in this case, 50% baby boys) than smaller samples. Therefore, hospital 1 would have more days with over 60% baby boys, as it has more opportunities for this rare event to occur.
