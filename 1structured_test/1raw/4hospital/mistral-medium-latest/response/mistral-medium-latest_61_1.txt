{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in hospital 2). A larger sample size means that there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions of boys, such as over 60%. This is due to the statistical property known as the law of large numbers, which states that the average of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables will tend towards the expected value as the number of observations increases. In this case, the expected proportion of boys is 50%, but hospital 1 is more likely to observe days where the proportion of boys is significantly higher than 50% due to its larger sample size.
