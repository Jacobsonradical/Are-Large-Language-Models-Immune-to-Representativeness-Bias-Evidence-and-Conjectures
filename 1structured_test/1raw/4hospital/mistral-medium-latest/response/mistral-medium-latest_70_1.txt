{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born because it has a larger sample size (45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 births per day). A larger sample size means that there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions of baby boys, such as over 60%. This is due to the statistical property of variance being inversely proportional to sample size. Therefore, hospital 1 would have more days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the mean of 50%. This answer assumes that the daily percentage of baby boys is independent and identically distributed for both hospitals.
