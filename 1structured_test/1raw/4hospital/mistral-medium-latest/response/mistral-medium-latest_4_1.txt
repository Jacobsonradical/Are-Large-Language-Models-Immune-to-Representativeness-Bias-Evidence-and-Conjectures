{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies/day compared to 15 babies/day in hospital 2). With a larger sample, it is more likely that there will be days where the percentage of baby boys is significantly higher than the overall average of 50%. In contrast, hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, so it is less likely that they will have as many days where over 60% of the babies born are boys.

This reasoning assumes that the daily percentage of baby boys is randomly distributed around the overall average of 50%. If this assumption holds true, then hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys due to its larger sample size. However, it's important to note that this is just a probabilistic argument and not a definitive conclusion, as the actual number of such days will depend on the specific daily distributions of baby boys in each hospital.
