{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 would likely have recorded more such days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in hospital 1 compared to hospital 2. With approximately 45 babies being born each day in hospital 1, there is a greater chance of having a higher proportion of baby boys on any given day due to statistical variation. On the other hand, hospital 2 has only about 15 babies born each day, which means that the proportion of baby boys is less likely to vary as much from the overall average of 50%. Therefore, it is less likely that hospital 2 would have as many days where over 60% of the babies born were boys.
