{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born at Hospital 1 each day compared to Hospital 2 (45 vs 15). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more days with an unusually high percentage of baby boys. This concept is rooted in statistical variation and the law of large numbers.

However, please note that this is a probabilistic reasoning and not a guaranteed outcome. In reality, the exact number of days would depend on the actual distribution of baby boys born each day at both hospitals. But based on the given information, it is more likely that Hospital 1 had more such days.
