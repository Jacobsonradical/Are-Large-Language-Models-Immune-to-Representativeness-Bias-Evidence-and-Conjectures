{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days, as it has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2. With a higher number of births, there is a greater chance of observing days where more than 60% of the babies are boys due to random variation. While it is possible that both hospitals have a similar number of these days, it is more probable that hospital 1 has more.
