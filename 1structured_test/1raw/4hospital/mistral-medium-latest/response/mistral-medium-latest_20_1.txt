{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). With a larger sample size, there is a greater chance of observing more extreme proportions of baby boys born on any given day, including days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. This concept is related to the law of large numbers, which states that the average of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables will approach their expected value as the number of variables increases. In this case, the expected proportion of baby boys is 50%, but the actual proportion will vary from day to day due to random chance. With a larger sample size, the actual proportion is more likely to deviate further from the expected value, increasing the chances of observing days with more than 60% baby boys.
