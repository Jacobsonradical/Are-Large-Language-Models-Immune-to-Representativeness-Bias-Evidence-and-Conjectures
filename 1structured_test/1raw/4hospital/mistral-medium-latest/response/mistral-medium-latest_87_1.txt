{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 would likely have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, it is more likely that there will be days where the percentage of baby boys is significantly higher than 50%. In contrast, hospital 2 has a smaller sample size, so the percentage of baby boys would need to be much higher in order to exceed 60%. Additionally, the larger sample size in hospital 1 means that the percentage of baby boys is likely to be more stable from day to day, making it less likely that there will be days where the percentage is significantly higher than 50%. However, it is still possible that hospital 2 could have recorded more such days if the percentage of baby boys was consistently higher than in hospital 1. Without more information, it is difficult to say for certain which hospital recorded more such days.

In conclusion, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to assume that hospital 1 recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys due to its larger sample size. However, it is still possible that hospital 2 could have recorded more such days if the percentage of baby boys was consistently higher than in hospital 1.
