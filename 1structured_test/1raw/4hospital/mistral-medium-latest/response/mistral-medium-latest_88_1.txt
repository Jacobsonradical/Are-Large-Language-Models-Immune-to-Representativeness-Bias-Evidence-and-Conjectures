{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions of baby boys born on any given day, such as over 60%. This is due to the statistical property known as "sampling variability," which states that larger samples are more likely to be representative of the overall population and thus have less variability in their statistics. Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to have had more days with over 60% baby boys than hospital 2.
