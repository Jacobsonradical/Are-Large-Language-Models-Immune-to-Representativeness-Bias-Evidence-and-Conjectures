{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. With a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in hospital 2), there is a higher probability of observing more extreme variations in the percentage of baby boys born on a given day. This includes days with a higher-than-average percentage of baby boys, such as over 60%.
