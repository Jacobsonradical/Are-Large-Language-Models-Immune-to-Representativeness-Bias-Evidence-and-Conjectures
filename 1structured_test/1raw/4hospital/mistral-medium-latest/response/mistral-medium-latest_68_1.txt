{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in Hospital 2). With a larger sample size, there is more variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day, increasing the likelihood of having days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.
