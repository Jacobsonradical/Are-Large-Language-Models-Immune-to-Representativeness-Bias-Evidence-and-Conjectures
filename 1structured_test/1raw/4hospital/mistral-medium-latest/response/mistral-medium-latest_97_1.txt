{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the higher number of daily births, which would result in a larger sample size and a greater chance of observing days with an unusually high percentage of boy births. This is a statistical phenomenon known as regression to the mean, which suggests that extreme values are more likely to occur in larger samples. Therefore, even though the overall percentage of boy births is the same for both hospitals, hospital 1 would be expected to have more days with over 60% boy births due to the larger number of daily births.
