{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days.

Since hospital 1 has a larger number of births per day (45 versus 15), it will have more variation in the percentage of baby boys born each day. This means that it is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

This is due to the statistical concept of sampling error, which states that larger samples (in this case, more births) will have results that are closer to the true population parameter (in this case, 50% baby boys), while smaller samples will have more variation.

Therefore, even though the percentage of baby boys is the same for both hospitals, the larger sample size of hospital 1 means that it is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.
