{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 would likely record more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. With a larger sample size of 45 babies per day, as opposed to Hospital 2's 15, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions of boys, such as over 60%. This concept is related to statistical variation and the law of large numbers. While the exact number of days cannot be determined without more specific data, it is reasonable to expect that Hospital 1 would have more days meeting this criteria than Hospital 2.
