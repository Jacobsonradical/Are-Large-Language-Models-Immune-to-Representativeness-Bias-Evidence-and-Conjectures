{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born because it has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day). A larger sample size means more opportunities for an unusually high percentage of baby boys to be born on a given day. This is due to the statistical concept of variance, which states that larger samples tend to have more stable proportions, while smaller samples are more prone to fluctuations and extremes.
