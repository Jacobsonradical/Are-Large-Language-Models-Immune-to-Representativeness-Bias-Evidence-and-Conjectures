{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys, compared to Hospital 2. This is due to the larger sample size of births in Hospital 1 (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions of baby boys born on a given day, such as over 60%. This concept is rooted in statistical variability and the law of large numbers. In other words, the proportion of baby boys in a larger sample will be closer to the expected value (50%) on average, but there will also be a higher probability of observing larger deviations from that expected value. Conversely, in a smaller sample, the proportion of baby boys is more likely to be closer to 50%, but there is a lower chance of observing larger deviations from that expected value.
