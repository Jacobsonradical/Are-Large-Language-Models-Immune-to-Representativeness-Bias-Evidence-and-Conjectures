{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size (45 babies per day compared to 15 babies per day in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, there is a higher probability of observing more extreme proportions of baby boys born on any given day, such as over 60%. This is due to the properties of statistical sampling and the law of large numbers. Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys than hospital 2.
