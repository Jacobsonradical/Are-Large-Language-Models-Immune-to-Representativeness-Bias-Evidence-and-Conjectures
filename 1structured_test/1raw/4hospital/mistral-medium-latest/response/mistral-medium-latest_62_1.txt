{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys compared to hospital 2. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in hospital 1 (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). With a larger sample size, there is a greater likelihood of observing more extreme deviations from the expected percentage of baby boys (50%). Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to have more days with over 60% baby boys than hospital 2.
