{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because it has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day at hospital 2). With a larger sample size, there is more variability in the percentage of boys born on any given day, making it more likely that some days will exceed the 60% threshold. This concept is related to the law of large numbers in statistics, which states that as the size of a sample increases, its mean will tend to become closer to the true population mean. In this case, the larger sample size at hospital 1 increases the likelihood of observing more extreme values (either higher or lower percentages of boys), including values over 60%.
