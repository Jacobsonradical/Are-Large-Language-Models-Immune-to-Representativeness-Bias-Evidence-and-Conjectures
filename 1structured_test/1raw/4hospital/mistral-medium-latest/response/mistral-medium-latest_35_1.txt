{hospital: 1}

I think hospital 1 recorded more such days because they have a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 compared to 15). With a larger sample size, it is more likely that there will be days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to random variation. This is known as the law of large numbers, which states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean will become closer to the true population mean. In this case, the true population mean is 50% boys. Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 1 will have days where the percentage of boys born is greater than 60%, simply due to the larger sample size.

Additionally, the fact that the exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day suggests that there is some randomness in the distribution of boys and girls born each day. With a larger sample size, this randomness is more likely to result in days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

Therefore, I believe that hospital 1 recorded more such days than hospital 2. However, it is important to note that this is a statistical prediction based on the information provided, and it is possible that the actual number of days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys could be different for each hospital.
