{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in hospital 1 compared to hospital 2. With approximately 45 babies born each day in hospital 1, there is a higher chance of having more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, as the larger sample size increases the likelihood of observing more extreme proportions of baby boys. In contrast, hospital 2, with only around 15 babies born each day, has a smaller sample size, and therefore a lower chance of observing days with over 60% baby boys.
