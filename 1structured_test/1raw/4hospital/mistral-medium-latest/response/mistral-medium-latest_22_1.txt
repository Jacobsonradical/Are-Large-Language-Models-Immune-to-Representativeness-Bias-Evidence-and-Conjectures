{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 would have more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the statistical concept of the law of large numbers. With more births occurring at Hospital 1 (about 45 per day compared to about 15 per day at Hospital 2), the percentage of boys born each day will be more stable and closer to the overall average of 50%. Conversely, with fewer births at Hospital 2, the percentage of boys born each day will have more variability and be more likely to exceed 60% on any given day.
