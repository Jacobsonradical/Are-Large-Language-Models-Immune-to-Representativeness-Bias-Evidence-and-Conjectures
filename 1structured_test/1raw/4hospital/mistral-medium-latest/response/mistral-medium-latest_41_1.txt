{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days. This is because hospital 1 has a larger number of births each day (45 versus 15 for hospital 2), so it will have more days where a relatively small number of girls being born can push the percentage of boys born above 60%, even if the overall percentage of baby boys is close to 50%. In contrast, hospital 2 would need a larger deviation from the 50% baseline in order to have over 60% boys born on a given day, due to the lower number of births.

This is a statistical phenomenon known as "sampling variability" or "variance," where larger sample sizes tend to have more stable proportions and smaller sample sizes tend to have more variable proportions.

Note that this is a probabilistic argument, and there is no guarantee that hospital 1 actually recorded more such days. But based on the information given, it is more likely that hospital 1 recorded more days with over 60% boys than hospital 2 did.
