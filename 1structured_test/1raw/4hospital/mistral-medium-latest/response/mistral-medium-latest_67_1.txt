{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 births per day). With a larger sample size, there is a higher probability of observing more extreme outcomes, such as more than 60% of babies being boys on a given day. The larger sample size increases the variability in the percentage of boys born each day, making it more likely that the percentage will exceed 60% on some days.
