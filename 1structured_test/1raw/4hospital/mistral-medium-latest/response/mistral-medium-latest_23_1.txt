{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day compared to 15 babies per day in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, there is a higher probability of observing more extreme values, such as over 60% of babies being boys in a given day.

However, please note that this answer is based on statistical probability and not on any specific data or trends observed in the two hospitals. It is possible that the actual number of days with over 60% baby boys could be different from what we would expect based on probability alone.
