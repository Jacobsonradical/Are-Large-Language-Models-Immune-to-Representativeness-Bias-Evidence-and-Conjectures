{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is due to the larger sample size of babies born each day in hospital 1 (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions of boys born on a given day. This is a statistical property known as the law of large numbers, which states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean will tend to approach the true population mean. In this case, the larger sample size in hospital 1 will result in a greater likelihood of observing extreme proportions of boys born on a given day, compared to hospital 2 with its smaller sample size.
