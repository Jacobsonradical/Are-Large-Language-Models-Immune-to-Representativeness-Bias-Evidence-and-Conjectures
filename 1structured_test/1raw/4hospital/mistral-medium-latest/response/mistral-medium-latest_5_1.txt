{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days. This is because the more babies born in a day, the less likely it is for over 60% of them to be boys due to the inherent variability in the gender distribution. Since Hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born each day compared to Hospital 2, it is statistically more likely that Hospital 1 would have more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. However, this is still just a probability and not a certainty. Please note that this is a statistical inference and not based on specific data or trends.
