{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% baby boys born. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (about 45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (about 15 births per day). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions, such as over 60% baby boys, even if the overall percentage of baby boys is the same for both hospitals.
