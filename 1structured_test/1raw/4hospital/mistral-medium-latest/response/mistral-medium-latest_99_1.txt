{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. With an average of 45 babies born per day, the hospital has a larger sample size compared to hospital 2, which averages 15 babies born per day. A larger sample size means that there is a higher likelihood of observing more extreme proportions (such as more than 60% baby boys), simply due to random variation. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that hospital 1 recorded more days with over 60% baby boys than hospital 2.
