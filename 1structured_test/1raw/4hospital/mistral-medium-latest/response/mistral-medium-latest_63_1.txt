{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days because it has a larger sample size (45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 births per day). With a larger sample size, there is a higher chance of observing more extreme proportions, such as more than 60% of baby boys born on a given day. This is due to the statistical concept of variability, which tends to decrease as sample size increases. Therefore, hospital 1 would have more opportunities for having days with an above-average percentage of baby boys.
