{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days where over 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 births per day). With a larger sample size, there is a higher likelihood of observing more extreme proportions of baby boys born, both above and below the average of 50%. Therefore, hospital 1 would have a higher chance of recording days with over 60% baby boys born.
