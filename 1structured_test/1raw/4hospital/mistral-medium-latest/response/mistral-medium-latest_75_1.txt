{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with over 60% of the babies born being boys. This is because hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 births per day in hospital 2). With a larger sample size, there is more variability in the percentage of boys born each day, making it more likely that some days will have over 60% boys. In other words, hospital 1 has a higher chance of observing extreme values due to the law of large numbers. This reasoning assumes that the percentage of boys born each day is a random variable with a mean of 50% and a standard deviation that is the same for both hospitals.

Note: This answer assumes that the variability in the percentage of boys born each day is due to random chance and not due to any systematic differences between the hospitals. If there are systematic differences (e.g., one hospital serves a population with a higher percentage of male births), then the answer may be different.
