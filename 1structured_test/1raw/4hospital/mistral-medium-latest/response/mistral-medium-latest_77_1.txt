{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days. Since Hospital 1 has a larger number of births each day (45 compared to 15 in Hospital 2), there is a higher chance of having a greater variation in the percentage of baby boys born on any given day. This means that Hospital 1 would have a higher probability of observing days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. This is due to the statistical property known as the law of large numbers, which states that as the size of a sample increases, the average of the sample will more closely approximate the true population mean. In this case, the smaller sample size of births in Hospital 2 will result in less variability and a lower chance of observing days with more than 60% baby boys.
