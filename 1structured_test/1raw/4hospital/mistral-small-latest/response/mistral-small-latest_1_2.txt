{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size generally leads to a more stable and predictable percentage of boys born each day, due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 1 will have days where the percentage of boys born is closer to the average (50%), and thus, it is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. Conversely, hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, will have more variability in the percentage of boys born each day, making it more likely to record days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. Thus, I predict that hospital 2 will record more such days.
