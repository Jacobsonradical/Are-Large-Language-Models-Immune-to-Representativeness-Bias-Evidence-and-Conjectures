Based on the information provided, both hospitals have different daily volumes of births, with hospital 1 having about 45 babies per day and hospital 2 having about 15 babies per day. The percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it's about 50%.

The key to this question lies in the variability of the percentage of baby boys. With a larger sample size (hospital 1 with 45 births per day), the law of large numbers suggests that the daily percentage of baby boys will be more consistent and closer to the average (50%). In contrast, with a smaller sample size (hospital 2 with 15 births per day), the daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to fluctuate and deviate from the average.

Given this, hospital 2 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys due to the increased variability in a smaller sample size. Therefore, I would predict that hospital 2 recorded more such days.

So, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
