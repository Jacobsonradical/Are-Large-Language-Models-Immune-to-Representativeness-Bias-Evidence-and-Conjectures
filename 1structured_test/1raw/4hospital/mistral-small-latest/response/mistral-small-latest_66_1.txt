{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). A higher number of births generally leads to a more consistent and predictable distribution of outcomes due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys is closer to the expected 50%, and thus, it is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. Consequently, Hospital 1 is expected to record fewer such days compared to Hospital 2.
