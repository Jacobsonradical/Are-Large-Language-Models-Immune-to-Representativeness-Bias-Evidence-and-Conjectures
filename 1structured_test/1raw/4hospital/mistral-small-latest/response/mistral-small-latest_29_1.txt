Based on the given information, both hospitals have a daily average number of births, but the sample size in hospital 1 is much larger than in hospital 2. Here's a breakdown:

- Hospital 1: 45 births/day
- Hospital 2: 15 births/day

The variation in the percentage of baby boys born each day is likely to be more significant in hospital 2 due to its smaller sample size. This is because with fewer births, the proportion of boys can swing more widely above or below the 50% average.

Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys, simply due to the smaller sample size leading to higher volatility in the percentage of boys born.

So, the answer is:

{hospital: 2}
