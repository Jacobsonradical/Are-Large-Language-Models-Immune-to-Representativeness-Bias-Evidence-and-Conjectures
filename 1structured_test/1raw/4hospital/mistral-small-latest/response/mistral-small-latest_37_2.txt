{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). With a larger sample size, the percentage of baby boys is more likely to remain close to the expected 50% due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, hospital 1 is less likely to have days with more than 60% baby boys, while hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, is more likely to have fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys, including days with more than 60% baby boys. Thus, hospital 1 is expected to record fewer such days.
