Based on the given information, both hospitals have different sample sizes for babies born each day. Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). A larger sample size generally leads to a more stable percentage when dealing with proportions, making it less likely to have extreme fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys from day to day.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is likely to have a more consistent daily percentage of baby boys around the 50% average, making it less likely to exceed 60% on any given day. Conversely, Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, is more likely to experience larger day-to-day variations in the percentage of baby boys, which could lead to more days where the percentage exceeds 60%.

Thus, I would predict that Hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys.

Answer: {hospital: 2}
