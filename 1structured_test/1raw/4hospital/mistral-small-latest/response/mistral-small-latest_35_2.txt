Based on the information provided, I would expect both hospitals to record a similar number of days with more than 60% of babies being boys. The probability of having more than 60% boys should be roughly the same regardless of the total number of births, assuming the 50% baseline probability of a baby being a boy. Therefore, I would answer:

{hospital: 3}
