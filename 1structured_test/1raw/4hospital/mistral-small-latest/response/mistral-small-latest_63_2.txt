Based on the information provided, let's analyze the situation:

- Hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15).
- The percentage of baby boys fluctuates daily, but on average, it is about 50%.

Given the larger sample size at Hospital 1, the Law of Large Numbers suggests that the daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to be closer to the average (50%) due to the larger number of births. This means that there will be fewer days where the percentage deviates significantly from the average, such as exceeding 60%.

In contrast, Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, will have more variation in the daily percentage of baby boys due to the smaller number of births. This increased variation means there will likely be more days where the percentage exceeds 60%.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Answer: {hospital: 2}
