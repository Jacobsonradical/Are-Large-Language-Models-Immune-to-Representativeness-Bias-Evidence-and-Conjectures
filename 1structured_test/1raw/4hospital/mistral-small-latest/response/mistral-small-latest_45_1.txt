{hospital 1: 3}

Explanation: The number of babies born each day does not affect the percentage of boys born. Both hospitals have the same underlying probability distribution for the percentage of baby boys, so they should record approximately the same number of days with more than 60% boys, within a reasonable margin of error. Therefore, I expect they are about the same (within 5% of each other).
