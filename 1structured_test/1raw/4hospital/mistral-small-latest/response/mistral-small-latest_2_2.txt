Based on the information provided, we can expect that both hospitals will have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to natural variation. However, Hospital 1 has a larger sample size each day (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). A larger sample size generally results in a more stable and predictable percentage of births being boys, as the law of large numbers comes into play. This means that Hospital 1 is likely to have fewer days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from the 50% average, including days where it exceeds 60%.

On the other hand, Hospital 2 with a smaller sample size is more likely to experience larger fluctuations in the percentage of boys born on a daily basis. This means that Hospital 2 might record more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys, but also more days where the percentage is significantly less than 50%.

Given this, it is likely that Hospital 2 will record more days with more than 60% boys due to the higher variability with a smaller sample size.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
