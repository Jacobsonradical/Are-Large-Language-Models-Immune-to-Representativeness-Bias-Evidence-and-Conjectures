Based on the information provided, the number of babies born each day is much higher in Hospital 1 (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). This means that Hospital 1 will have a larger sample size each day, which leads to a more stable percentage of baby boys from day to day due to the law of large numbers. In contrast, Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, will experience more day-to-day variability in the percentage of baby boys.

Given this variability, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the 50% average, including days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. Therefore, Hospital 2 is likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys.

Answer: {hospital: 2}
