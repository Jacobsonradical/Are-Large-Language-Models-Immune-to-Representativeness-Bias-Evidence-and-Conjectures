{hospital 1: 3}

Explanation: The number of births in each hospital is not a factor in determining the percentage of baby boys born each day. Both hospitals have the same 50% baseline probability for each baby being a boy or a girl. Therefore, the variation in the percentage of baby boys from day to day should be similar in both hospitals. Hence, they should record about the same number of days with more than 60% baby boys, within a 5% margin of error.
