Based on the information provided, both hospitals have a 50% chance of having more than 60% boys on any given day. However, hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day). A larger sample size reduces the variability and makes the actual percentage of baby boys closer to the expected 50% on a daily basis. Therefore, hospital 1 is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

So, I would answer:
{hospital1: 2, hospital2: 1} (hospital 2 recorded more such days)
