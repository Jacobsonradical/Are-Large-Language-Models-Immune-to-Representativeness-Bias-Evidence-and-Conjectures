Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Hospital 1**: 45 babies are born each day, which means that 60% of them being boys translates to \( 0.60 \times 45 = 27 \) boys.
2. **Hospital 2**: 15 babies are born each day, which means that 60% of them being boys translates to \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \) boys.

The variance in the proportion of boys born in a day is likely influenced by the law of large numbers, which states that as the number of trials increases, the observed frequency converges to the expected frequency.

- **Hospital 1** has a larger sample size (45 babies) compared to **Hospital 2** (15 babies). With a larger sample size, the actual percentage of boys born on any given day is more likely to be closer to the expected 50% due to the law of large numbers.
- **Hospital 2**, with a smaller sample size, is more susceptible to fluctuations in the percentage of boys born due to the smaller sample size.

Given these points, **Hospital 2** is more likely to record days where more than 60% of the babies are boys simply because the smaller sample size can result in a higher variance in the proportion of boys born.

Therefore, I think **Hospital 2** recorded more such days.
