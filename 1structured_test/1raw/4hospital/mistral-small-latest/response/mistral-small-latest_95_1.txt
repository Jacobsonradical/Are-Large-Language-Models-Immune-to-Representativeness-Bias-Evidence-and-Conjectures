To determine which hospital recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys, we need to consider the variability and the laws of large numbers.

Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day. The larger the sample size, the more likely the percentage of boys will be close to the expected 50%. This is due to the law of large numbers, which states that as the number of trials increases, the actual ratio of outcomes will converge to the expected ratio.

Therefore, Hospital 1, with a larger sample size, will have the percentage of boys born each day closer to 50% than Hospital 2. This means that Hospital 1 is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys, because the daily fluctuations will be smaller compared to Hospital 2.

Thus, Hospital 2, with the smaller sample size, will have more variability in the percentage of boys born each day. This increased variability means that Hospital 2 is more likely to record days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

So, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
