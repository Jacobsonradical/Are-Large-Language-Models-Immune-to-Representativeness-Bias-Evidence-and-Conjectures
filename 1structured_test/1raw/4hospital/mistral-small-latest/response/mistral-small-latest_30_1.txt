Based on the information provided, I would answer:

{hospital: 1}

Here's my reasoning:

- Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15).
- A larger sample size reduces the impact of random variations, making the percentage of baby boys more stable around the expected 50%.
- Therefore, Hospital 1 is less likely to have days where more than 60% of babies are boys due to random chance alone.
- Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to experience days where more than 60% of babies are boys simply due to random variations in the births.
- Thus, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more such days.
