{hospital_1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). A larger sample size generally results in a more stable and reliable percentage of baby boys each day. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 will have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys, simply due to the law of large numbers. Consequently, Hospital 1 is expected to record more such days compared to Hospital 2.
