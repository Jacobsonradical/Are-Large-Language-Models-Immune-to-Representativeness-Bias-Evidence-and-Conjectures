{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size typically results in a more stable and predictable percentage of baby boys due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, it is less likely that Hospital 1 will have days with more than 60% boys because the variation will be less pronounced. In contrast, Hospital 2 with a smaller sample size will experience more fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys from day to day, making it more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. Hence, Hospital 1 is expected to record fewer such days.
