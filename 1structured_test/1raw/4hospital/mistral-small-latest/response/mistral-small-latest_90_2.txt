Based on the information provided, the variance in the number of births per day is not taken into account. Hospital 1 has a much higher daily birth rate (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). This higher volume could lead to more variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day, potentially resulting in more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. Therefore, I would answer:

{hospital: 1}
