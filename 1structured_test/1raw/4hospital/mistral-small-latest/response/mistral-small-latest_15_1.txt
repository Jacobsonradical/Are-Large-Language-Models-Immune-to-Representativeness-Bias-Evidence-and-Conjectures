Based on the information provided, both hospitals have the same percentage of baby boys being born each day, which is around 50%. The variation in the percentage of baby boys born each day is likely to be similar for both hospitals since no information suggests otherwise. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that both hospitals would record a similar number of days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

Given that the question asks for an answer within a 5% difference, I would say they are about the same.

Answer:
{hospital: 3}
