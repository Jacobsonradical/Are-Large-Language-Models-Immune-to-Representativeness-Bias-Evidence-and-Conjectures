To determine which hospital recorded more days with more than 60% of babies being boys, we need to consider the variability and sample size of each hospital.

Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). A higher sample size generally leads to more stable percentages due to the law of large numbers. In other words, the daily percentage of boys born in Hospital 1 is likely to be closer to the expected 50% than in Hospital 2.

For Hospital 1:
- The expected number of boys per day is around 22.5 (45 babies * 50%).
- To have more than 60% boys, Hospital 1 would need more than 27 boys born in a day.

For Hospital 2:
- The expected number of boys per day is around 7.5 (15 babies * 50%).
- To have more than 60% boys, Hospital 2 would need more than 9 boys born in a day.

Given the smaller sample size in Hospital 2, the daily percentage of boys is likely to be more variable. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from 50%, either above or below.

Considering this variability, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

So the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
