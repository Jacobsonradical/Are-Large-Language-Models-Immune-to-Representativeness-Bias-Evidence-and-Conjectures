Based on the information provided, I would expect Hospital 1 to record more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys. This is because Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 compared to 15 in Hospital 2). A larger sample size generally leads to results that are closer to the expected average (in this case, 50% boys), and thus, the proportion of boys is less likely to fluctuate greatly from day to day. Therefore, I expect that Hospital 1 will have a more stable percentage of boys born each day, resulting in more days where the percentage exceeds 60%.

So, my answer is: {hospital: 1}
