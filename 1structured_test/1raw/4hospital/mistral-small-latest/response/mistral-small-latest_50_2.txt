Based on the given information, I would predict that Hospital 1 would record more days with more than 60% boys. This is because Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 compared to 15 in Hospital 2), which would lead to a more stable and predictable percentage of boys from day to day. Smaller sample sizes can lead to wider fluctuations in percentages due to random chance. Therefore, I would answer:

{hospital1: 1}
