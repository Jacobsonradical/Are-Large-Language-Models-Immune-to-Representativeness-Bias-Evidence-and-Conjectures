Based on the information provided, both hospitals have a daily average number of births, but Hospital 1 has a significantly higher average (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). The percentage of baby boys varies daily, but the average is 50%.

The key factor here is the sample size. With a larger sample size (Hospital 1 with 45 births per day), the percentage of boys is more likely to stabilize around the mean (50%). In contrast, with a smaller sample size (Hospital 2 with 15 births per day), the percentage of boys can fluctuate more significantly from day to day due to the smaller number of births.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys simply because of the higher variability in a smaller sample size.

So, my answer in the specified format is:
{hospital: 2}
