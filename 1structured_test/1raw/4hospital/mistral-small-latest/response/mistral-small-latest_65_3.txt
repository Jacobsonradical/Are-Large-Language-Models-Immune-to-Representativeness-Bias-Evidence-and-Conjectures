{hospital: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size generally leads to more stable and predictable percentages due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, Hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more days with exactly 60% boys because the daily variation in the percentage of baby boys is likely to be smaller due to the larger sample size.
