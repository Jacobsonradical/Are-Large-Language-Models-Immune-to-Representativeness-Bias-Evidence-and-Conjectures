Based on the information provided, both hospitals have a 50% chance of having more than 60% boys on any given day. However, hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies). A larger sample size is less likely to be influenced by random fluctuations, leading to a more stable proportion of boys. Therefore, hospital 1 is likely to have more days with exactly 60% boys, but it's also less likely to have days with significantly more than 60% boys.

Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have days with a very high percentage of boys (due to random chance), but also days with a very low percentage of boys. Overall, I would expect both hospitals to have a similar number of days with more than 60% boys, but the exact number could vary more for hospital 2 due to its smaller sample size.

So, I would say they are about the same (within 5% of each other).

Answer: {hospital: 3}
