{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 records more births daily (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to experience days where more than 60% of babies are boys due to the law of large numbers. This principle states that as the number of trials increases, the actual ratio of outcomes will tend to approach the expected ratio. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have more days with more than 60% boys.
