Based on the given information, both hospitals have different daily birth rates, with hospital 1 having about 45 births per day and hospital 2 having about 15 births per day. The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it's about 50%.

When considering the variability in the percentage of baby boys, a hospital with a higher number of births per day would have a larger sample size and thus, the law of large numbers would make the percentage of baby boys born on any given day more likely to be close to the average (50%).

Given this, hospital 1, with a higher daily birth rate, would likely have fewer days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys because the larger sample size makes it less likely to deviate significantly from the average.

Therefore, I predict that hospital 2, with the smaller daily birth rate, would likely record more days with more than 60% baby boys due to the smaller sample size allowing for more variability.

Answer:
{hospital: 2}
