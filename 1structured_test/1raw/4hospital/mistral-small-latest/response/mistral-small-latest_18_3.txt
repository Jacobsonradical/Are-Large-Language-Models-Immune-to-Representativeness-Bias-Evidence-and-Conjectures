Let's think through this problem step-by-step:

1. **Daily Births**:
   - Hospital 1: 45 babies/day
   - Hospital 2: 15 babies/day

2. **Expected Daily Births of Boys**:
   - With a 50% chance of being a boy, we expect:
     - Hospital 1: \(45 \times 0.50 = 22.5\) boys/day
     - Hospital 2: \(15 \times 0.50 = 7.5\) boys/day

3. **Variation in Percentage of Boys**:
   - The actual number of boys born in a day will vary due to random chance.
   - For a hospital to record more than 60% boys, the number of boys born must be greater than 60% of the total births that day.

4. **Impact of Sample Size**:
   - A larger sample size (Hospital 1 with 45 births vs Hospital 2 with 15 births) tends to result in proportions that are closer to the expected value (50% boys) due to the law of large numbers.
   - Conversely, a smaller sample size (Hospital 2) can show more variability, leading to a higher likelihood of days where the percentage of boys exceeds 60%.

Considering the above points, Hospital 2 is more likely to record days where more than 60% of the babies are boys due to the smaller sample size and the higher variability it introduces.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
{hospital: 2}
```
