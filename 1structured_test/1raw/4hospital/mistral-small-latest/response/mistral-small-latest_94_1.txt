{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size tends to result in a more stable percentage of baby boys from day to day due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys is exactly or very close to 50%, making it less likely to have days with more than 60% boys. In contrast, Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have days with a higher percentage of baby boys due to greater variability in the smaller sample. Thus, Hospital 1 is expected to record fewer days with more than 60% boys, and Hospital 2 is expected to record more such days.
