Based on the information provided, both hospitals have different daily volumes of births, with Hospital 1 having about 45 babies per day and Hospital 2 having about 15 babies per day. The percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it's about 50%.

When considering days with more than 60% boys, the variance is likely to be more pronounced in the hospital with fewer births (Hospital 2) because the smaller sample size can lead to more significant fluctuations in the percentage of boys born on a given day.

Therefore, I would expect Hospital 2 to record more days with more than 60% boys.

So, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
