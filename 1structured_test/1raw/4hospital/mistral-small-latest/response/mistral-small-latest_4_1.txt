{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a higher average daily number of births (45 vs 15). With a larger sample size, the law of large numbers suggests that the percentage of boys born each day is more likely to closely reflect the overall 50% average. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record days where more than 60% of the babies are boys due to the higher number of births, which increases the likelihood of deviating from the mean.
