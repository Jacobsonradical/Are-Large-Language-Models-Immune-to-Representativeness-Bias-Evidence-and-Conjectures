{hospital1: 3, hospital2: 3}

Explanation:
Since the percentage of baby boys born each day varies randomly, the likelihood of recording a day with more than 60% boys is the same for both hospitals regardless of the number of babies born there. Therefore, both hospitals should record about the same number of such days, making them within 5% of each other.
