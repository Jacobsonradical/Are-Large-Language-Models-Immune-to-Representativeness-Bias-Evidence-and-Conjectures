Based on the information provided, both hospitals have different daily birth rates, but the probability of a baby being a boy is the same for both hospitals (50%). The variation in the percentage of baby boys from day to day is random and should not be systematically different between the two hospitals. Therefore, regardless of the number of births per day, the likelihood of having more than 60% of babies being boys on any given day should be similar for both hospitals. Thus, I predict that both hospitals should record approximately the same number of such days, within 5% of each other.

Answer: {hospital: 3}
