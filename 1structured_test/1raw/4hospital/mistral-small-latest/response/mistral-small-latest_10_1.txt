Based on the information provided, both hospitals have a similar probability of recording days where more than 60% of babies born are boys, as the percentage of baby boys varies randomly. However, Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). A larger sample size generally results in a more stable and consistent percentage of boys, making it less likely for Hospital 1 to have days with more than 60% boys. Therefore, I would expect Hospital 2 to record more such days.

Answer:
{hospital: 2}
