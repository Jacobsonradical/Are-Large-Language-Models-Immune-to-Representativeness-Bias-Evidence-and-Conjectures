{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size generally leads to a more stable and reliable percentage when dealing with probabilistic events like the birth of boys and girls. Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys due to the law of large numbers, which states that as the number of trials increases, the actual ratio of outcomes will tend to converge with the expected ratio. Hence, hospital 1 is more likely to record more such days.
