Based on the information provided, the number of births in hospital 1 is three times that of hospital 2, which means there are more individual data points in hospital 1. However, the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, and the question asks about the days when more than 60% of the babies are boys. Since we don't have information on the distribution of these percentages, it's difficult to predict which hospital would record more such days. It could depend on the specific variations in the percentage of baby boys born each day in each hospital. Without additional data on these variations, it's not possible to give a definitive answer. Therefore, I would choose 3:

{hospital: 3}
