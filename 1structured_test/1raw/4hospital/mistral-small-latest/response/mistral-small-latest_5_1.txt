Based on the information provided, the variation in the percentage of baby boys from day to day is likely due to random chance. Since both hospitals have a similar process for giving birth to babies, it's reasonable to expect that the days with more than 60% boys would be similar in both hospitals. Additionally, the larger sample size in hospital 1 (45 births per day) should lead to a more consistent percentage of boys, making it less likely to have extreme variations. Therefore, I expect that they are about the same (within 5% of each other).

Answer: {hospital: 3}
