Based on the information provided, it's likely that Hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys. Here's why:

- Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of babies born per day (15) compared to Hospital 1 (45).
- A smaller sample size increases the chance of seeing more extreme fluctuations in percentages due to the law of small numbers.
- Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys simply by chance.

So, my answer is {hospital: 2}.
