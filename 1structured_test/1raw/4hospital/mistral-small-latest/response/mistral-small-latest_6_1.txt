{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size tends to result in proportions that are closer to the expected value (in this case, 50% boys) and are less variable. Therefore, hospital 1 is less likely to have days with more than 60% boys due to the law of large numbers, while hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, is more likely to have days where the proportion of boys deviates significantly from 50%. Thus, hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys.
