{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size reduces the impact of random variation, making it less likely that the percentage of baby boys will deviate significantly from the expected 50%. Therefore, Hospital 1 is less likely to have days where more than 60% of babies are boys, so Hospital 2 is more likely to record more such days.
