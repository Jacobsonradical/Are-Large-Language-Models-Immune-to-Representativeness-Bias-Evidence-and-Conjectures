Based on the information provided, it's likely that both hospitals will have similar variations in the percentage of baby boys born each day. However, hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day). A larger sample size generally leads to results that are closer to the expected average (in this case, 50% boys). Therefore, hospital 1 is less likely to deviate significantly from the 50% average, making it less likely to record days with more than 60% boys.

So, I would say that hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% boys.
