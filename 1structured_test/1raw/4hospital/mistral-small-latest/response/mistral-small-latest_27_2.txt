{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size generally leads to a more stable percentage and is less affected by daily fluctuations. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys is closer to the expected 50%, and thus, it is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, is more likely to experience days with a higher percentage of baby boys due to random chance.
