{hospital: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). A higher number of births per day leads to a larger sample size, which can result in more days where the percentage of baby boys falls exactly within or crosses the 60% threshold due to random variation. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys.
