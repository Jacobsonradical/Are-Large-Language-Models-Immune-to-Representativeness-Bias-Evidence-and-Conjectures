Based on the information provided, it's important to note that the number of births in Hospital 1 is three times that of Hospital 2. This means that Hospital 1 has a larger sample size each day, which can lead to more fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys born.

Given that the exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day and sometimes may be higher than 50%, it's reasonable to expect that Hospital 1, with its larger sample size, would experience days where more than 60% of the babies are boys more frequently than Hospital 2.

Therefore, I would predict that Hospital 1 recorded more such days.

Answer:
{hospital1: 1}
