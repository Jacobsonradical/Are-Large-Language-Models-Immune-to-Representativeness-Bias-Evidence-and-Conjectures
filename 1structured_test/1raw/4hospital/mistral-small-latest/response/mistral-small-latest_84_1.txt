Based on the given information, we can't definitively say which hospital recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys because the variation in the percentage of baby boys is random and not influenced by the hospital size. Therefore, both hospitals should have about the same proportion of days with more than 60% baby boys, within a margin of error.

So, the answer is:
{hospital: 3}
