Based on the information provided, both hospitals have different daily birth rates (45 in hospital 1 and 15 in hospital 2). The variance in the number of births each day is likely to affect the percentage of boys born on any given day.

Hospital 1, with a higher number of births per day, is more likely to have a more stable percentage of boys due to the law of large numbers. This means that the percentage of boys born is more likely to be close to the expected 50% most of the time. Conversely, Hospital 2, with fewer births, will have more variability in the percentage of boys born on any given day.

Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 2 will record more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys simply because of the higher variability in a smaller sample size.

So, my answer is:
{hospital: 2}
