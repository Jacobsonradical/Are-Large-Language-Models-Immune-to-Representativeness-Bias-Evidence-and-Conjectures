Given the information:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies born each day
- Hospital 2: 15 babies born each day
- Overall, 50% of babies are boys

A higher number of births per day can result in a more stable percentage of boy births due to a larger sample size. Therefore, Hospital 1, with 45 births per day, is likely to have a more consistent 50% boy birth rate compared to Hospital 2, which has only 15 births per day.

Thus, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys because the smaller sample size can lead to more variability.

So, the answer is: {hospital: 2}
