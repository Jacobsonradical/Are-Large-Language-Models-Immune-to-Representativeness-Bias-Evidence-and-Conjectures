Based on the information provided, the percentage of baby boys born varies from day to day. Both hospitals have different daily birth rates, but the variability in the percentage of baby boys is not dependent on the number of births but rather on random chance. Therefore, the probability of recording a day with more than 60% baby boys should be similar for both hospitals.

Given that both hospitals are subject to the same random variation in the percentage of baby boys, they should record approximately the same number of days with more than 60% baby boys.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
{hospital: 3}
```
