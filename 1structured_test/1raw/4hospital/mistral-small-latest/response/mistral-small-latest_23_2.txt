Based on the information provided, both hospitals have similar probabilities of recording days with more than 60% boys. However, Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). A larger sample size generally results in a more stable percentage, making it less likely to have extreme fluctuations in the percentage of boys born. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 2 will record more days with more than 60% boys due to its smaller sample size leading to more variability.

So, my answer is:
{hospital: 2}
