{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a higher daily average of births (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). With higher numbers of births, there is more variability in the percentage of boys born each day. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 will have more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.
