Based on the information provided, we can't definitively say which hospital recorded more such days without more specific data on the variation of the percentage of baby boys born each day. However, since both hospitals have the same probability of having more than 60% boys on any given day, we would expect them to record a similar number of such days over the course of a year. Therefore, the most likely answer is:

{hospital: 3}
