Based on the information provided, both hospitals have different daily birth rates, but the percentage of baby boys born each day is subject to the same random variation. Since the variance and distribution of the percentage of baby boys born are likely to be similar in both hospitals, it's reasonable to expect that the number of days with more than 60% baby boys would be proportional to the number of births recorded.

Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys due to the larger sample size, which reduces the impact of daily random variation.

So, I would answer:
{hospital: 1}
