{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). This means that Hospital 1 is more likely to have a larger sample size of babies born each day. A larger sample size reduces the variability caused by random chance, making it more likely for the percentage of baby boys to be closer to the expected 50%. Therefore, it is less likely for Hospital 1 to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. In contrast, Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, is more likely to experience days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the expected 50%, including days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. Hence, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more such days.
