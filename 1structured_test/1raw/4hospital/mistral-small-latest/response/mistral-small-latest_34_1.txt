To determine which hospital recorded more days with more than 60% of babies being boys, we need to consider the variability and the sample size in each hospital.

Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day. The larger sample size in Hospital 1 means that the percentage of boys is likely to be more stable and closer to the average of 50% due to the law of large numbers. In contrast, Hospital 2 with a smaller sample size will experience more variability in the percentage of boys from day to day.

Given this variability, Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from 50%, either above or below. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

So, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
