{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size is less likely to be significantly affected by random daily variations in the percentage of baby boys. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have a stable percentage of baby boys close to the expected 50% and thus is less likely to record days with more than 60% boys. Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to experience days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the expected 50%, potentially recording more days with more than 60% boys.
