{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size generally leads to a more consistent percentage of baby boys from day to day due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys, as the percentage is less likely to fluctuate significantly from the expected 50%.
