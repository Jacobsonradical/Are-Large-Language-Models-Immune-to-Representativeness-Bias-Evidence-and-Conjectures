Explanation:

The proportion of baby boys born each day is subject to random variation, but on average, it's 50% at both hospitals. The number of babies born per day is much higher in hospital 1 (45) compared to hospital 2 (15), which means that even if the percentage of baby boys fluctuates, the absolute number of baby boys born will vary more in hospital 1. Consequently, it is more likely that hospital 1 will record days with more than 60% baby boys due to the larger sample size. However, both hospitals will experience similar proportions of days with more than 60% baby boys relative to their daily birth rates. Therefore, they are likely to be within 5% of each other in terms of the number of days recorded.
