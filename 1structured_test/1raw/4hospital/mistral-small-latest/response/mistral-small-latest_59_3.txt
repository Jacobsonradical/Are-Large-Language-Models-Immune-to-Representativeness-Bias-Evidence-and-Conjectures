Based on the information given, the number of births per day is much higher in hospital 1 (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies). This larger sample size in hospital 1 suggests that the percentage of baby boys born each day is likely to be more consistent with the overall average (50%) due to the law of large numbers. In contrast, hospital 2 with a smaller sample size is more likely to experience larger day-to-day fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys.

Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 2 will record more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys, simply because of the higher variability in the smaller sample size.

So, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
