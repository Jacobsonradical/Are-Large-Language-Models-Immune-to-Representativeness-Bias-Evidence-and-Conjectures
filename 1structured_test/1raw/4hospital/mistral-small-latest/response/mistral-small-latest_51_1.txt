Based on the information provided, both hospitals have the same overall probability of a baby being a boy (50%). However, hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 births per day).

A larger sample size reduces the variability in the percentage of boys born each day due to the Law of Large Numbers. Therefore, hospital 1 is less likely to have days where more than 60% of babies are boys because the daily percentage is more likely to stay close to the average (50%).

In contrast, hospital 2 with a smaller sample size will have more variability in the daily percentage of boys born. This means it is more likely to have days where more than 60% of babies are boys.

Thus, hospital 2 is more likely to record more such days.

Answer:
{hospital: 2}
