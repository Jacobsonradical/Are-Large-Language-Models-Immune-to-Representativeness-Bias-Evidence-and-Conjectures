Based on the information provided, it's likely that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys. This is because Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 births per day compared to 15 in Hospital 2), which reduces the impact of random variation. Therefore, the percentage of boys is likely to be closer to the overall average of 50% in Hospital 1, potentially crossing the 60% threshold more often.

So, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
