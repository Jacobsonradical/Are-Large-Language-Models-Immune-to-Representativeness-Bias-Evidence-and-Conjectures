Based on the information provided, both hospitals have different daily birth rates, but the probability of a baby being a boy is the same (50%). The variation in the percentage of baby boys from day to day is likely to be similar for both hospitals due to the laws of large numbers. Therefore, I would expect the number of days with more than 60% boys to be proportional to the number of births. Since Hospital 1 has a higher birth rate, it is more likely to record more such days.
