Based on the information provided, both hospitals have different daily birth rates, with hospital 1 having a significantly higher number of daily births compared to hospital 2.

Given that the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day around a 50% average, the larger sample size at hospital 1 is more likely to yield a more stable and consistent distribution of births by gender due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, the chances of hospital 1 recording days with more than 60% boys are likely to be more consistent and frequent compared to hospital 2, which has a smaller sample size.

Thus, I would predict that hospital 1 recorded more such days.

Answer: {hospital: 1}
