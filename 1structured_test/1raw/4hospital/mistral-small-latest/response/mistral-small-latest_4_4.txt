Based on the information provided, both hospitals have different daily birth rates: Hospital 1 has about 45 births per day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 births per day. The variation in the percentage of baby boys from day to day is likely to have a more significant impact on the smaller sample size (Hospital 2) than on the larger sample size (Hospital 1).

With a larger number of births per day, Hospital 1 is likely to have a more stable percentage of baby boys due to the law of large numbers, which states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean gets closer to the expected mean. Therefore, Hospital 1 is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys because the daily variation is averaged out over a larger number of births.

In contrast, Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, is more susceptible to day-to-day fluctuations. This means that Hospital 2 is more likely to record days where more than 60% of the babies are boys due to the higher variability in a smaller sample size.

Therefore, I would predict that Hospital 2 recorded more such days.

Answer:
{hospital: 2}
