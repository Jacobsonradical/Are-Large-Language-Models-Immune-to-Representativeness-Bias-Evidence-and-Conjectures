Based on the information given, the variance in the percentage of baby boys born each day is likely to be similar for both hospitals, as the overall percentage is the same (50%). However, hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day). A larger sample size tends to result in a more stable and consistent percentage, meaning that hospital 1 is less likely to have days with more than 60% boys due to random variation. Therefore, I predict that hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys.

Answer: {hospital: 2}
