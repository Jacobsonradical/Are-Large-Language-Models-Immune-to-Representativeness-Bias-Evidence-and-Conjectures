Based on the information provided, both hospitals have a daily average number of births, but Hospital 1 has a significantly higher average (45 births per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 births per day).

When considering the variation in the percentage of baby boys born each day, a higher number of births per day in Hospital 1 would likely result in a more stable percentage of baby boys due to the law of large numbers. This means that Hospital 1 is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys because the percentages are more likely to cluster around the average.

In contrast, Hospital 2, with a smaller number of births per day, is more likely to experience days where the percentage of baby boys deviates more from the average due to the smaller sample size. This could lead to more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

So, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
