Let's analyze the situation:

1. Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
2. Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.

The variation in the percentage of baby boys is random, but we're looking for days when more than 60% of the babies are boys.

- For Hospital 1, to have more than 60% boys out of 45 births, you would need at least 27 boys.
- For Hospital 2, to have more than 60% boys out of 15 births, you would need at least 9 boys.

Since the percentage of boys varies randomly, the probability of having more than 60% boys in a day is essentially the same for both hospitals. However, the sample size (number of births) is larger in Hospital 1, which should lead to more consistent results around the 50% average. This means Hospital 1 is likely to have fewer days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from 50%, including days with more than 60% boys.

Considering this, I would say that Hospital 2 is likely to record more days with more than 60% boys because the smaller sample size will result in more fluctuation around the 50% average.

So, my answer is:
{hospital: 2}
