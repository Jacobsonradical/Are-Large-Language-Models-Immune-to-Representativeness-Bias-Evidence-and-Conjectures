{hospital1: 3}

Explanation: The number of babies born each day in both hospitals is sufficiently large to ensure that the percentage of boys born on any given day will likely be close to the expected 50%. Both hospitals will have days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%, but the variability is expected to be similar due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that both hospitals will record a similar number of such days, making them about the same within 5%.
