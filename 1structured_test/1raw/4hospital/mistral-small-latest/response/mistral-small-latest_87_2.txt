Let's break down the problem to determine which hospital is likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys.

### Hospital 1:
- Daily births: 45 babies
- Probability of exactly 60% being boys: 45 * 0.60 = 27 boys

### Hospital 2:
- Daily births: 15 babies
- Probability of exactly 60% being boys: 15 * 0.60 = 9 boys

### Variability:
- Smaller sample sizes (like in Hospital 2) tend to have higher variability in percentages due to the law of small numbers.
- Larger sample sizes (like in Hospital 1) tend to have percentages that are closer to the expected mean.

Given that Hospital 2 has a smaller daily sample size, it is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys is significantly higher or lower than 50%. Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

### Conclusion:
Hospital 2 is more likely to record more such days.

So, the answer is:
```
{hospital: 2}
```
