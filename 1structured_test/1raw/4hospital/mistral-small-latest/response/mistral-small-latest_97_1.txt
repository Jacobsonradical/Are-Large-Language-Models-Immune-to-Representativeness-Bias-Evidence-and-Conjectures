{hospital 1: 3}

Explanation: Since the percentage of baby boys born each day fluctuates, the number of days on which more than 60% of the babies born are boys should be relatively similar in both hospitals. The difference in the total number of babies born daily (45 in hospital 1 vs. 15 in hospital 2) does not significantly affect the probability of having more than 60% boys on any given day. Therefore, both hospitals should record approximately the same number of such days.
