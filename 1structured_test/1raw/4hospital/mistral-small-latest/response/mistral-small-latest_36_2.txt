{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a higher daily volume of births (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60% due to the law of large numbers, which states that as the sample size increases, the actual percentage will be closer to the expected percentage (50% in this case). Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 will record more days with more than 60% baby boys.
