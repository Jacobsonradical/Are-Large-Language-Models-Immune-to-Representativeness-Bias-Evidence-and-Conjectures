Based on the information provided, I would expect both hospitals to have a similar number of days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys. The variability in the percentage of baby boys is random and not dependent on the hospital. Therefore, I predict that they will have about the same number of such days.

So, my answer is:
{hospital: 3}
