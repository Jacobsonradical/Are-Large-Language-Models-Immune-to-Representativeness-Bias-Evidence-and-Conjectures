Based on the information provided, both hospitals have varying numbers of births each day, with Hospital 1 having approximately 45 births and Hospital 2 having approximately 15 births. The percentage of baby boys varies daily, but on average, it is about 50%.

When considering the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys, the variability due to the law of large numbers comes into play. Hospital 1, with a higher number of births per day, should experience fewer days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from the average 50%. This is because the larger sample size reduces the impact of random fluctuations.

Conversely, Hospital 2, with fewer births per day, will experience more variability in the percentage of boys born each day. This means that there will be more days where the percentage of boys born exceeds 60%.

Therefore, I would expect Hospital 2 to record more such days.

Answer:
{hospital: 2}
