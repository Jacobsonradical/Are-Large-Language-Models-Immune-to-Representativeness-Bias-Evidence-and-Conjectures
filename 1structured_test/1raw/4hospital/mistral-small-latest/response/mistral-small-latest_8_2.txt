To determine which hospital recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys, we need to consider the variability and the sample size of each hospital.

Hospital 1:
- Approximately 45 babies are born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies, but on average, it is around 50%.

Hospital 2:
- Approximately 15 babies are born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys also varies, but on average, it is around 50%.

Given that the births at each hospital are independent events, the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day will be greater in the hospital with a smaller number of births per day. This is due to the law of large numbers, which states that as the number of trials increases, the actual ratio of outcomes will tend to get closer to the expected ratio.

Therefore, Hospital 2, with fewer births per day (15), will experience more variability in the percentage of baby boys from day to day compared to Hospital 1 (45 births per day). This increased variability means that there is a higher chance for Hospital 2 to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys, simply due to the smaller sample size causing more fluctuation around the 50% average.

Thus, I would expect Hospital 2 to record more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

Answer:
{hospital: 2}
