{hospital1: 1}

Hospital 1, with a higher number of births per day (45), is likely to have more days with more than 60% boys due to the law of large numbers. The higher volume of births makes it more likely that the percentage of boys will be closer to the expected 50% on any given day, and thus more likely to exceed 60% on some days. Hospital 2, with only 15 births per day, will have a smaller sample size, leading to more variability in the percentage of boys from day to day, and potentially fewer days exceeding 60% boys.
