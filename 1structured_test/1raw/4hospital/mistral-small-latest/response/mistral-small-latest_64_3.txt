{hospital: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a higher average number of births per day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). A higher number of births per day results in more variability in the percentage of baby boys from day to day due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.
