Given the information, we need to consider the variability and sample sizes of each hospital.

- Hospital 1: 45 babies born per day.
- Hospital 2: 15 babies born per day.

The variance in the percentage of baby boys is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of births due to the Law of Large Numbers. This means that Hospital 1, with a larger sample size, will have a more stable percentage of baby boys from day to day, making it less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, will experience more variability in the percentage of baby boys from day to day, making it more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

Answer: {hospital: 2}
