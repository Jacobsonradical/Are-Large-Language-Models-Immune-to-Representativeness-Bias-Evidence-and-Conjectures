{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). Larger sample sizes generally lead to proportions that are more stable and closer to the expected value (in this case, 50% boys). Therefore, Hospital 1 is likely to have fewer days with an extreme proportion (like more than 60% boys) due to the law of large numbers. Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to experience fluctuations and thus record more days with more than 60% boys.
