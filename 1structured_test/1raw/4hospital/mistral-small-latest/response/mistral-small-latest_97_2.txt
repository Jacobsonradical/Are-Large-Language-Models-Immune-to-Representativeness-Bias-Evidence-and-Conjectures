Based on the information provided, both hospitals have the same probability of having more than 60% baby boys on any given day. The variation in the percentage of baby boys is random and independent of the hospital. Therefore, I would expect both hospitals to record roughly the same number of days with more than 60% baby boys.

So, my answer is:
{hospital: 3}
