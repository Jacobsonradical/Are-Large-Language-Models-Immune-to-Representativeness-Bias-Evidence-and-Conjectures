Based on the information provided, I would predict that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys being born. This is because Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 compared to 15 in Hospital 2), which would lead to less variability in the percentage of boys born each day due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, I would expect Hospital 1 to have a narrower range of daily percentages of boys, and thus more days where the percentage exceeds 60%.

So my answer is:
{hospital1: 1}
