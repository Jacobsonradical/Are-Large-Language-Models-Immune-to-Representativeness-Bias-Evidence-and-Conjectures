Given the information provided, let's analyze the situation:

1. **Hospital 1** has about 45 babies born each day.
2. **Hospital 2** has about 15 babies born each day.
3. The percentage of baby boys varies, but on average, it's 50%.

For a day to be recorded as having more than 60% boys, the number of boys born must be significantly above the average.

### Variability and Sample Size
- **Hospital 1**: With 45 births per day, the expected number of boys is \( 45 \times 0.50 = 22.5 \) boys. To exceed 60%, you would need \( 45 \times 0.60 = 27 \) boys.
- **Hospital 2**: With 15 births per day, the expected number of boys is \( 15 \times 0.50 = 7.5 \) boys. To exceed 60%, you would need \( 15 \times 0.60 = 9 \) boys.

### Probability Considerations
- **Hospital 1**: The probability of getting 27 boys out of 45 is significantly lower than getting 9 boys out of 15 because the sample size is larger, and thus, the variability is lower.
- **Hospital 2**: The probability of getting 9 boys out of 15 is higher than for Hospital 1 because the sample size is smaller, and thus, the variability is higher.

### Conclusion
Given the higher variability in a smaller sample size, **Hospital 2** is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. Therefore, it is probable that Hospital 2 recorded more such days.
