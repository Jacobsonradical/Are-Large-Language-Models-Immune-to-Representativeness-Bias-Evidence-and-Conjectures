Based on the information provided, both hospitals have the same overall percentage of baby boys (50%), but the exact percentage varies from day to day. Since the number of babies born each day is significantly higher in hospital 1 (45 babies) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies), the variation in the percentage of baby boys from day to day is likely to be smaller in hospital 1 due to the law of large numbers. This means that hospital 1 is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. Therefore, I would expect hospital 2 to record more such days.

So, my answer is:
{hospital: 2}
