Given the information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but this percentage varies daily.

The question is about which hospital recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Since the percentage of boys born each day varies, we can expect that both hospitals will have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. However, the sample size in Hospital 1 is significantly larger than in Hospital 2. A larger sample size generally leads to results that are closer to the expected mean due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, Hospital 1 might see days where the percentage of boys is closer to the average (50%), while Hospital 2 might see more fluctuations due to its smaller sample size.

Therefore, I would expect Hospital 2 to record more days with more than 60% boys because of the smaller sample size and thus more variability.

So, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
