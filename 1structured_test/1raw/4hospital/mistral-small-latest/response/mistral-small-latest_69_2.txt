Based on the information provided, both hospitals have different daily birth counts. Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth count (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). However, the percentage of babies being boys is a random variable that can fluctuate daily.

A higher number of births generally leads to a more stable percentage of boys over time due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, Hospital 1, with a larger sample size, is expected to have a more consistent 50% boys, making it less likely to deviate significantly from this average on any given day.

Conversely, Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, is more likely to experience days with a higher percentage of boys simply because of random variation.

Thus, Hospital 2 is likely to record more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

Answer: {hospital: 2}
