Based on the information provided, both hospitals have different daily birth rates, with hospital 1 having a higher number of births per day. However, the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day and is not directly influenced by the number of births. Therefore, the likelihood of having more than 60% of babies being boys on any given day should be similar for both hospitals, as it depends on the natural variation in birth percentages rather than the number of births.

Thus, I would expect that both hospitals recorded about the same number of such days, within 5% of each other.

So the answer is: {hospital: 3}
