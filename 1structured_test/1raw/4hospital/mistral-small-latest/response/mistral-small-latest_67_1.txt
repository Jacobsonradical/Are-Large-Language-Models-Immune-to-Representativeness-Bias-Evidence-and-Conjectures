Based on the information provided, both hospitals have a 50% chance of boys being born each day. The variation in the percentage of baby boys from day to day is random and would affect both hospitals similarly. Therefore, regardless of the number of births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys on any given day should be the same for both hospitals. Thus, I would expect that both hospitals recorded approximately the same number of such days.

Answer: {hospital: 3}
