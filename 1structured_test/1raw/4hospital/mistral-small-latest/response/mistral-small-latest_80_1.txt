Based on the information provided, both hospitals have different daily birth rates, but the probability of a baby being a boy is the same (50%) and varies similarly day-to-day. Since the percentage of baby boys varies, the likelihood of exceeding 60% on any given day should be similar for both hospitals. Therefore, I would expect them to record a similar number of days with more than 60% boys. Thus, the answer is:

{hospital: 3}
