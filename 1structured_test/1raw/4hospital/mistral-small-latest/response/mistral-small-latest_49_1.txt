In this scenario, we can expect that the larger sample size (hospital 1 with 45 babies per day) will result in the percentage of baby boys being closer to the expected 50% on a daily basis due to the law of large numbers. This means that hospital 1 is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

On the other hand, hospital 2 with only 15 babies per day will have a wider fluctuation in the percentage of baby boys due to the smaller sample size. This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

Therefore, I would expect hospital 2 to record more such days.

Answer: {hospital: 2}
