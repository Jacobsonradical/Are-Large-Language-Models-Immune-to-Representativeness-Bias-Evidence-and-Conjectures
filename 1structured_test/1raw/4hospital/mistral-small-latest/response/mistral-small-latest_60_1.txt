Based on the information provided, it's important to consider the variability in the number of births and the potential for random fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys.

Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). This higher volume of births means that Hospital 1 is likely to have more days where the exact percentage of baby boys is closer to the average (50%) due to the law of large numbers. As a result, Hospital 1 might experience fewer days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly above 60%.

In contrast, Hospital 2, with a lower daily birth rate, will have more variability in the percentage of baby boys from day to day. This higher variability increases the likelihood that on some days, more than 60% of the babies will be boys.

Given these factors, it is reasonable to expect that Hospital 2 might record more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
