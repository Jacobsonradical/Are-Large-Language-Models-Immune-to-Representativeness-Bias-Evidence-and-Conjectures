Based on the information provided, it's likely that Hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% boys. This is because Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 vs 45 in Hospital 1). With a smaller sample size, the percentage of boys can vary more greatly from day to day due to random chance. Therefore, it's more likely for Hospital 2 to have days where the percentage of boys is significantly higher than 50%, possibly exceeding 60%.

So, my answer is:
{hospital: 2}
