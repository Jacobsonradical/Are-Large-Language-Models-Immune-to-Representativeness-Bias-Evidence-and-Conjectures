I would answer:

{
  "hospital_1": 1,
  "hospital_2": 3
}

Here's my reasoning:

- Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size generally results in a more stable percentage of baby boys from day to day due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, it's less likely that hospital 1 will have days where more than 60% of babies are boys.
- Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, will have more variability in the percentage of baby boys from day to day. This increased variability makes it more likely that hospital 2 will have days where more than 60% of babies are boys.
- However, hospital 2 is still likely to have fewer such days than hospital 1 in absolute terms due to its smaller size. Therefore, I believe hospital 1 will record more days with more than 60% boys, but the difference will not be significant (within 5%).
