{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a higher daily birth rate (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). This means that Hospital 1 will have more samples each day to determine if more than 60% of the babies are boys. With a larger sample size, the daily percentage of baby boys born is more likely to be closer to the expected 50%, and thus, more likely to exceed 60% on any given day. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.
