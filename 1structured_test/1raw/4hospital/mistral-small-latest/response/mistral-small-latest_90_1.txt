{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). A larger sample size reduces the impact of random variation, making the percentage of boys born each day more stable and closer to the expected 50%. Therefore, it is less likely that Hospital 1 will have days with more than 60% boys, while Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys deviates more significantly from the expected 50%.
