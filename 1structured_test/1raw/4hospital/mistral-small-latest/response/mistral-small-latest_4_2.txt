{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2. This larger sample size means that the daily percentage of baby boys is more likely to be closer to the average (50%) due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, hospital 1 is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys, so hospital 2 is more likely to record more such days.
