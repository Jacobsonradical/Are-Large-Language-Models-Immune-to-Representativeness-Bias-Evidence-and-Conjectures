{hospital1: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size tends to result in a more stable and representative percentage of boy babies from day to day due to the Law of Large Numbers. Therefore, Hospital 1 is likely to have fewer days with more than 60% boys because the daily percentage is less likely to deviate significantly from the 50% average. Conversely, Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys deviates more from the average, potentially recording more days with more than 60% boys. Thus, Hospital 1 is likely to record fewer such days compared to Hospital 2.
