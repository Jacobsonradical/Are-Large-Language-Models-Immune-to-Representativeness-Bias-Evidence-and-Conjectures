Based on the information given, both hospitals experience day-to-day variations in the percentage of baby boys born. However, Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size generally leads to a more stable percentage and is less likely to be heavily influenced by small fluctuations. Therefore, Hospital 1 is likely to have a more consistent 50% boys ratio and would require a more significant deviation to reach over 60%. In contrast, Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, might experience more fluctuations and thus could record more days with over 60% boys.

Considering this, I would lean towards Hospital 2 recording more such days.

Answer: {hospital 2: 2}
