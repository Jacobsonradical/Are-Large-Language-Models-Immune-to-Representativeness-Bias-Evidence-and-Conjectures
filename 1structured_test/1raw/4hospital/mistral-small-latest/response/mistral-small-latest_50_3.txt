{hospital 1: 3}

Explanation: The number of births in Hospital 1 is approximately three times that of Hospital 2 (45 vs. 15). Despite the larger sample size in Hospital 1, the proportion of boys born each day is expected to fluctuate similarly in both hospitals due to the laws of large numbers. Therefore, the variation in the percentage of boys born is likely to be similar in both hospitals, leading to a comparable number of days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. Thus, I expect the number of such days to be about the same in both hospitals.
