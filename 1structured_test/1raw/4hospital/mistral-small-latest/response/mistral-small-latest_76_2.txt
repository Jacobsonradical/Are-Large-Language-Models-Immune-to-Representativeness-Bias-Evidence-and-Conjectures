To determine which hospital recorded more days with more than 60% of babies being boys, we need to consider the variability and the number of births in each hospital.

### Hospital 1:
- Daily births: 45
- Expected number of boys if 50%: 45 * 0.5 = 22.5
- To exceed 60%: More than 27 boys (45 * 0.6)

### Hospital 2:
- Daily births: 15
- Expected number of boys if 50%: 15 * 0.5 = 7.5
- To exceed 60%: More than 9 boys (15 * 0.6)

Given the smaller sample size in Hospital 2, the proportion of boys can fluctuate more dramatically from day to day compared to Hospital 1. This higher variability means that Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of boys deviates significantly from the 50% average, either above or below.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.
