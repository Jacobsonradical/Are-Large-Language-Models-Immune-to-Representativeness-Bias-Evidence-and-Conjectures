{hospital: 1}

Explanation:
Hospital 1 has a higher number of births per day compared to Hospital 2, which increases the variability and potential for days where more than 60% of babies are boys. This higher volume can lead to more fluctuations in the percentage of boys born each day. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days where over 60% of the babies are boys.
