{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a higher number of daily births (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys due to the law of large numbers. This principle suggests that as the number of trials increases, the actual ratio of outcomes will tend to match the expected ratio more closely. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys.
