Based on the information provided, it is likely that Hospital 2 recorded more days with more than 60% of babies being boys. The reason is that Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size of babies born each day (15 compared to 45 in Hospital 1). Smaller sample sizes are more likely to have a higher percentage of one gender due to random chance. Therefore, I would answer:

{hospital: 2}
