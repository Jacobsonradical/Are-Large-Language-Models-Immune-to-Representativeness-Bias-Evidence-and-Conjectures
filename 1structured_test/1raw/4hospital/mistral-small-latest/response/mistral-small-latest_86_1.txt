Based on the information provided, both hospitals have the same overall percentage of baby boys (50%), but they have different daily volumes of births. Hospital 1 has a higher daily volume than Hospital 2, which could lead to more fluctuations in the percentage of boys born each day. However, the question is about the percentage of days with more than 60% boys, not the total number of days with more than 60% boys.

Given that both hospitals have the same overall percentage of boys, and assuming that the day-to-day variation in the percentage of boys is random, both hospitals should have a similar percentage of days with more than 60% boys. Therefore, I would expect them to be about the same (within 5% of each other).

Answer: {hospital: 3}
