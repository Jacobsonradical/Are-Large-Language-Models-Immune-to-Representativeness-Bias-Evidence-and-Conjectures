Given that the number of births in hospital 1 is significantly higher than in hospital 2, the percentage of boys born on any given day will be more stable and less subject to fluctuation due to the larger sample size. This is because a larger sample size reduces the influence of random variations.

Therefore, hospital 1 is likely to have a more consistent percentage of boys born each day, making it less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. In contrast, hospital 2, with a smaller number of births, will experience more variability in the percentage of boys born, potentially leading to more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

Thus, I would predict that hospital 2 recorded more such days.

Answer: {hospital: 2}
