Based on the information provided, I would answer as follows:

{hospital: 1}

Here's why: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). A larger sample size generally leads to results that are closer to the expected percentage (in this case, 50% boys) due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, it is less likely for Hospital 1 to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys, while Hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, is more likely to have such fluctuations. Thus, Hospital 1 is expected to record fewer such days.
