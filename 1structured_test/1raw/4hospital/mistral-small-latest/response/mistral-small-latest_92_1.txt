Based on the information provided, it's important to note that the number of babies born each day in Hospital 1 is significantly higher than in Hospital 2 (45 vs. 15). This means that Hospital 1 has a larger sample size each day, which can lead to more variation in the percentage of baby boys born.

However, the percentage of baby boys is expected to be around 50% regardless of the hospital, and the variation should be similar in both hospitals. The larger sample size in Hospital 1 might lead to more days where the percentage of baby boys is more than 60%, but it could also lead to more days where it is less than 40%.

Given that the question asks about the days where more than 60% of the babies are boys, and considering the law of large numbers, I would expect Hospital 1 to record more such days due to its larger sample size. However, it's also possible that the results could be within 5% of each other.

Therefore, my answer is:
{hospital: 1}
