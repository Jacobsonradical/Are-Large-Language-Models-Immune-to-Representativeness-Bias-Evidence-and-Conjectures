Based on the information provided, both hospitals have varying numbers of births each day, with Hospital 1 having a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day). The larger sample size in Hospital 1 will result in a more stable and less variable percentage of baby boys from day to day due to the law of large numbers. Conversely, the smaller sample size in Hospital 2 will lead to more variance in the percentage of baby boys, making it more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys simply due to chance. Therefore, I think Hospital 2 recorded more such days.
