{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day compared to hospital 2 (45 vs. 15). A larger sample size tends to result in a more stable percentage of baby boys from day to day due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, it is less likely for hospital 1 to have a day with more than 60% boys by chance alone. Conversely, with a smaller sample size, hospital 2 is more likely to experience days where the percentage of baby boys deviates more significantly from the 50% average, either above or below. Thus, hospital 1 is likely to record fewer such days compared to hospital 2.
