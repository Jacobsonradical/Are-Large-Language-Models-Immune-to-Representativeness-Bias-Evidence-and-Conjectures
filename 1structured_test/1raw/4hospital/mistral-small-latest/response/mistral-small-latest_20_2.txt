Based on the information provided, since the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day and the exact percentage is not specified, it's reasonable to assume that both hospitals would have days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys. However, hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day). A larger sample size tends to stabilize the percentage closer to the expected mean, which is 50% in this case. Therefore, hospital 1 might have fewer days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from 50%, including days where it exceeds 60%.

On the other hand, hospital 2 with a smaller sample size might experience more days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from 50%, including days where it exceeds 60%.

Considering these factors, I would lean towards thinking that hospital 2 recorded more such days.

Answer: {hospital: 2}
