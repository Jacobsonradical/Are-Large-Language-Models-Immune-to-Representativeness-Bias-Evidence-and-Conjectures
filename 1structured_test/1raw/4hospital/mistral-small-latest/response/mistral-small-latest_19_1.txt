Based on the information provided, both hospitals have a 50% chance of having more than 60% boys on any given day. However, hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to hospital 2 (15 babies per day). A larger sample size reduces the variability due to random chance, so hospital 1 is likely to have a more stable percentage of boys each day, making it less likely to have days with more than 60% boys. Therefore, I would expect hospital 2 to record more such days.

Answer: {hospital: 2}
