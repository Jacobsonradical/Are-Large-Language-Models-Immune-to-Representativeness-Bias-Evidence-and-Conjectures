Based on the information provided, both hospitals have different daily birth rates (hospital 1: 45 babies/day, hospital 2: 15 babies/day). The variation in the number of births can affect the percentage of baby boys born each day.

Hospital 1, with a higher daily birth rate, is likely to have more days where the exact number of baby boys is closer to 50% of the total births due to the law of large numbers. This means that the percentage of baby boys is more likely to be stable and around the expected 50%. Therefore, Hospital 1 is less likely to have days with more than 60% baby boys.

Hospital 2, with a lower daily birth rate, is more susceptible to day-to-day fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys. This means that it is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from the expected 50%, including having more days with more than 60% baby boys.

Therefore, I predict that Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys.

Answer: {hospital: 2}
