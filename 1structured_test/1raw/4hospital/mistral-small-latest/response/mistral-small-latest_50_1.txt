{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 has a larger sample size with 45 births per day compared to Hospital 2 with 15 births per day. A larger sample size is less likely to be affected by the variability in the percentage of baby boys, leading to a more stable daily percentage. Therefore, Hospital 1 is less likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys, whereas Hospital 2, with its smaller sample size, is more likely to have such fluctuations. Hence, Hospital 1 is expected to record fewer such days.
