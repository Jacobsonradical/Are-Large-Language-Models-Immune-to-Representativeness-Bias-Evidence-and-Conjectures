Based on the information provided, both hospitals have different daily birth rates, but the probability of a baby being a boy is the same for both. Since the variation in the percentage of baby boys is random and not dependent on the number of births, both hospitals should, on average, have the same percentage of days where more than 60% of the babies are boys. Therefore, they should record about the same number of such days.

Answer: {hospital: 3}
