Given that the number of babies born per day is higher in hospital 1 compared to hospital 2, the variance in the percentage of baby boys born each day is likely to be more pronounced in hospital 1. This is because a smaller sample size in hospital 2 (15 babies per day) will result in the percentage of boys fluctuating less dramatically around the 50% average compared to hospital 1 (45 babies per day).

Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 1 will record more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys due to the larger sample size leading to greater variability.

So, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
