Based on the information provided, the variance in the percentage of baby boys born each day is likely to have a greater impact on the smaller sample size. Since hospital 2 has a smaller daily number of births (15 babies per day compared to 45 at hospital 1), the fluctuation in the percentage of boys born will be more pronounced. This means that hospital 2 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys, as well as days where less than 40% are boys. Therefore, I would expect hospital 2 to record more days with more than 60% baby boys.

So, my answer is {hospital: 2}.
