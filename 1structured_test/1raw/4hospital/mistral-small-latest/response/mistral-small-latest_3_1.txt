{hospital1: 1}

Explanation: Hospital 1 records more babies being born each day compared to Hospital 2. A higher number of births results in more variability in the percentage of boys born on any given day. Therefore, it is more likely that Hospital 1 will have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys due to the increased sample size and potential variability.
