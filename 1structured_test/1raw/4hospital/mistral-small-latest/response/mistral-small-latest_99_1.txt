Based on the given information, the number of babies born each day is significantly higher in Hospital 1 (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). While the overall percentage of baby boys is about 50%, the higher daily volume in Hospital 1 would result in a larger absolute number of boys being born each day. This larger sample size would likely lead to more days where more than 60% of the babies are boys due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, I predict that Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies were boys.

Answer:
{hospital: 1}
