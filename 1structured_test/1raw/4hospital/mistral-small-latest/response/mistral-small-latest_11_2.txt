Based on the information provided, it's likely that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys. The reason is that Hospital 1 has a larger sample size of babies born each day (45 vs 15). A larger sample size leads to less variability in the percentage of baby boys from day to day. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys falls above 60%.

So, the answer is {hospital: 1}.
