Based on the information provided, both hospitals have a daily average number of births, but Hospital 1 has a significantly higher average (45 babies) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies). The percentage of baby boys varies day to day, but on average, it's 50%.

The variance in the percentage of baby boys is likely to be more pronounced in Hospital 2 due to the smaller sample size. This means that Hospital 2 is more likely to have days where more than 60% of the babies are boys, simply due to the law of small numbers.

Therefore, I would predict that Hospital 2 recorded more such days.

So, the answer is: {hospital: 2}
