Given the information that hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day and hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day, and considering that the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day around a 50% average, we need to determine which hospital is more likely to record days with more than 60% baby boys.

The variability in the percentage of baby boys each day is crucial. With a larger sample size (45 babies in hospital 1 vs. 15 babies in hospital 2), the Law of Large Numbers suggests that the percentage of baby boys born in hospital 1 will be more stable and closer to the expected 50% on any given day. In contrast, hospital 2, with a smaller sample size, will experience more variability in the percentage of baby boys from day to day due to the smaller number of births.

Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys deviates significantly from 50%, including exceeding 60%.

Thus, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
