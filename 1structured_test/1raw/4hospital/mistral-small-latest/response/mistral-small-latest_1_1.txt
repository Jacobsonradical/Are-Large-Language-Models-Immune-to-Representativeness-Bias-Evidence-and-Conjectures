{hospital 1: 3}

Explanation:

Since the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day and can sometimes be higher or lower than 50%, it's reasonable to expect that the number of days with more than 60% boys will be due to random chance. The number of births per day in each hospital doesn't affect the probability of having more than 60% boys, as the ratio of boys to girls is independent of the total number of births. Therefore, both hospitals should record a similar number of such days, making them about the same (within 5% of each other).
