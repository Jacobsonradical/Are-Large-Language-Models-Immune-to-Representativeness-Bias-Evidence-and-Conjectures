To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the expected percentage of baby boys born.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

We need to find out which hospital recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Assumption: For a day to be recorded, more than 60% of the babies born must be boys.

Hospital 1:
- The expected number of baby boys born per day is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5.
- For more than 60% of the babies to be boys, the minimum number of baby boys born per day must be 45 × 0.6 = 27.
- This means that on any given day, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is 1 - P(having less than 27 baby boys) = 1 - (22.5 / 45)^45 ≈ 0.0000054.

Hospital 2:
- The expected number of baby boys born per day is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.
- For more than 60% of the babies to be boys, the minimum number of baby boys born per day must be 15 × 0.6 = 9.
- This means that on any given day, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is 1 - P(having less than 9 baby boys) = 1 - (7.5 / 15)^15 ≈ 0.0007.

Since the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is significantly higher for Hospital 2 (0.0007) compared to Hospital 1 (0.0000054), we can conclude that Hospital 2 is more likely to record more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
