To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it is around 50%.

The key observation is that the larger the sample size (number of babies born), the closer the observed percentage of boys will be to the expected 50%. This is due to the law of large numbers.

In Hospital 1, with 45 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day is lower than in Hospital 2, with only 15 babies born per day.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys than Hospital 1.

The answer is:
{hospital: 2}
