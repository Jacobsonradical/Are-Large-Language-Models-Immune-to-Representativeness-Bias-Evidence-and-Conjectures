To solve this problem, we need to consider the variation in the percentage of baby boys born each day. Since the exact percentage varies from day to day, sometimes being higher than 50% and sometimes lower, we can expect that both hospitals will have some days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

The key factor that will determine which hospital records more such days is the number of babies born per day in each hospital.

Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.

With a larger sample size, Hospital 1 is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%. Even small variations in the percentage of baby boys can have a greater impact on the smaller sample size of Hospital 2.

Therefore, I believe that Hospital 1 will have recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
