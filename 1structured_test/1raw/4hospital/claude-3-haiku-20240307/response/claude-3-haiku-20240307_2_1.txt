To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys in a day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For hospital 1:
- Average number of baby boys per day = 45 × 0.5 = 22.5
- Standard deviation = √(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 3.75
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (> 27 boys) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27) = 0.1772

For hospital 2:
- Average number of baby boys per day = 15 × 0.5 = 7.5
- Standard deviation = √(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 1.93
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (> 9 boys) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9) = 0.1466

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys is higher for hospital 1 (17.72%) compared to hospital 2 (14.66%). Therefore, hospital 1 is expected to record more such days.
