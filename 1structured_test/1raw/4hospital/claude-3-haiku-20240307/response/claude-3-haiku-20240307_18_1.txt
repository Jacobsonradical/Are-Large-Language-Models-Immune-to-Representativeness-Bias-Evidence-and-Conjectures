To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, and it is around 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day follows a binomial distribution. The probability of having more than 60% boys can be calculated using the binomial probability formula.

For hospital 1, with 45 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (more than 27 boys) is higher than for hospital 2, with 15 babies born per day.

Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys.
