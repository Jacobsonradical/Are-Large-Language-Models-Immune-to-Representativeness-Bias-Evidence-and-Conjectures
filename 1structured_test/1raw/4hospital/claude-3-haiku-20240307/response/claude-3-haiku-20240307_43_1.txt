To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born on a given day.

Given:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born on a given day follows a binomial distribution, with the following parameters:

- Number of trials (n): 45 for hospital 1 and 15 for hospital 2
- Probability of success (p): 0.5 (50% of babies are boys)
- Desired outcome: more than 60% of babies are boys, which means at least 27 out of 45 babies (for hospital 1) and at least 10 out of 15 babies (for hospital 2) are boys.

To calculate the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born on a given day, we can use the binomial cumulative distribution function (CDF) in Python.

For hospital 1:
Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys = 1 - binomial_cdf(26, 45, 0.5) = 0.1092

For hospital 2:
Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys = 1 - binomial_cdf(9, 15, 0.5) = 0.1405

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys is slightly higher for hospital 2 compared to hospital 1. Therefore, hospital 2 is likely to record more days with more than 60% of baby boys.
