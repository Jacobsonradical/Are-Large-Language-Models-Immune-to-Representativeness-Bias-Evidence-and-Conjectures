Let's think this through step-by-step:

1. Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, and Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
2. The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, 50% of all babies are boys.
3. For a period of 1 year, each hospital recorded the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
4. Since Hospital 1 has more babies born each day, it is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.
5. Assuming the variation in the percentage of baby boys is random and not correlated between the two hospitals, Hospital 1 is more likely to have more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
