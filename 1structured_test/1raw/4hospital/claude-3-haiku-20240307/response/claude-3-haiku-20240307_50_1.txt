To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution and how it applies to the given scenario.

In this case, the number of baby boys born in each hospital follows a binomial distribution with a probability of success (being a boy) of approximately 0.5 (50%).

The question states that the exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but the overall probability of a baby being a boy is around 50%.

To determine which hospital recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys, we need to calculate the probability of this event occurring for each hospital and compare them.

The probability of more than 60% of the babies being boys in a day can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula. For hospital 1, with an average of 45 babies born per day, the probability of more than 60% of them being boys is approximately 0.1789. For hospital 2, with an average of 15 babies born per day, the probability is approximately 0.2772.

Since the probability is higher for hospital 2, it is more likely that hospital 2 recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 2}
