To solve this problem, we need to determine which hospital is more likely to have more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% of babies born as boys on a given day is higher for the hospital with a smaller number of births per day.

This is because with a smaller sample size (i.e., fewer babies born per day), the percentage of boys can fluctuate more significantly from the 50% average.

In the case of Hospital 1 with 45 babies born per day, the percentage of boys is more likely to be closer to the 50% average, making it less likely to exceed 60% on a given day.

On the other hand, Hospital 2 with 15 babies born per day has a smaller sample size, and the percentage of boys can more easily exceed 60% on a given day.

Therefore, I believe that Hospital 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
