To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it is around 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys in a given day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For Hospital 1:
- With 45 babies born each day, the expected number of baby boys is 22.5 (50% of 45).
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 27 baby boys) is approximately 0.233 or 23.3%.

For Hospital 2:
- With 15 babies born each day, the expected number of baby boys is 7.5 (50% of 15).
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 9 baby boys) is approximately 0.265 or 26.5%.

Since the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys is higher in Hospital 2 (26.5%) compared to Hospital 1 (23.3%), Hospital 2 is expected to record more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
