To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it is about 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day follows a binomial distribution.

For Hospital 1:
- The expected number of baby boys per day is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys per day is √(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 3.375.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (27 or more) is approximately 0.1985 (using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution).

For Hospital 2:
- The expected number of baby boys per day is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys per day is √(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 1.875.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (9 or more) is approximately 0.2389 (using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution).

Since the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys is higher for Hospital 2 (0.2389) compared to Hospital 1 (0.1985), we can conclude that Hospital 2 is expected to record more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
