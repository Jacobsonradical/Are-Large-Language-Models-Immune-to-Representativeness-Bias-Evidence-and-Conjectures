To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day.

Given:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day follows a binomial distribution.

For hospital 1:
- The expected number of baby boys born each day is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys is √(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 3.75.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 27 boys) in a day is approximately 0.0668 (using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution).

For hospital 2:
- The expected number of baby boys born each day is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys is √(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 1.93.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 9 boys) in a day is approximately 0.1056.

Since the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys in a day is higher for hospital 2 (0.1056) compared to hospital 1 (0.0668), hospital 2 is expected to record more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 2}
