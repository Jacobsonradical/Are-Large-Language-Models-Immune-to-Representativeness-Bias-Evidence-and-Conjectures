To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a single day.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, and it is sometimes higher than 50% and sometimes lower.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a single day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For hospital 1:
- The expected number of baby boys born per day is 0.5 × 45 = 22.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys born per day is sqrt(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 3.75.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a single day is approximately 0.23 (using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution).

For hospital 2:
- The expected number of baby boys born per day is 0.5 × 15 = 7.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys born per day is sqrt(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 1.93.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a single day is approximately 0.14 (using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution).

Since the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a single day is higher for hospital 1 than for hospital 2, hospital 1 is likely to have recorded more such days over the course of a year.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 1}
