To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probability of having more than 60% baby boys born in each hospital.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it is about 50%.

The binomial distribution can be used to model the number of baby boys born in each hospital on a given day.

For Hospital 1:
- The number of trials (babies born) is 45.
- The probability of success (having a baby boy) is 0.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% baby boys is the sum of the probabilities of having 28 or more baby boys out of 45.

For Hospital 2:
- The number of trials (babies born) is 15.
- The probability of success (having a baby boy) is 0.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% baby boys is the sum of the probabilities of having 10 or more baby boys out of 15.

Comparing the probabilities:
- The probability of having more than 60% baby boys is higher in Hospital 2 than in Hospital 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
