To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, and it is around 50% on average.

Let's calculate the expected number of boys born in each hospital on a given day:
- Hospital 1: 45 × 50% = 22.5 boys
- Hospital 2: 15 × 50% = 7.5 boys

Now, to have more than 60% of the babies born as boys, the following conditions must be met:
- Hospital 1: More than 27 boys (60% of 45 babies)
- Hospital 2: More than 9 boys (60% of 15 babies)

The probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day is the same for both hospitals, as the percentage of baby boys is around 50% on average.

However, the number of days when this condition is met will be different for the two hospitals due to the difference in the number of babies born per day.

Hospital 1 has a higher number of babies born per day, so it is more likely to have more days where more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 1}
