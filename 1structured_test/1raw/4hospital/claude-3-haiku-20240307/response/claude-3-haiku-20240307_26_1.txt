To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% of babies born as boys in each hospital.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% of babies born as boys follows a binomial distribution with parameters n (number of babies born) and p (probability of a baby being a boy).

For Hospital 1:
- Number of babies born per day (n) = 45
- Probability of a baby being a boy (p) = 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of babies born as boys = P(X > 0.6 * 45) = 0.2212

For Hospital 2:
- Number of babies born per day (n) = 15
- Probability of a baby being a boy (p) = 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of babies born as boys = P(X > 0.6 * 15) = 0.2946

The probability of having more than 60% of babies born as boys is higher for Hospital 2 (0.2946) compared to Hospital 1 (0.2212), meaning that Hospital 2 is more likely to record more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
