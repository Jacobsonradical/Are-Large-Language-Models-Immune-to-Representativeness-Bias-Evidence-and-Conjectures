To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probability of having more than 60% boys born in each hospital.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% boys born in a day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For hospital 1:
- Total number of babies born per day: 45
- Expected number of boys: 45 × 0.5 = 22.5
- Standard deviation: √(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 3.375
- Probability of having more than 60% boys (> 27 boys) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27) = 0.1056

For hospital 2:
- Total number of babies born per day: 15
- Expected number of boys: 15 × 0.5 = 7.5
- Standard deviation: √(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 1.9365
- Probability of having more than 60% boys (> 9 boys) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9) = 0.1572

The probability of having more than 60% boys is higher in hospital 2 (0.1572) compared to hospital 1 (0.1056). Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys born.
