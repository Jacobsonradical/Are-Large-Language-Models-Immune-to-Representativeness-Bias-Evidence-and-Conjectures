To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day.

Given information:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies born each day
- Hospital 2: 15 babies born each day
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

To have more than 60% boys on a given day, we need to have at least 60% of the babies born on that day to be boys.

For Hospital 1:
- 60% of 45 babies = 27 boys
- The probability of having more than 27 boys out of 45 babies is higher than the probability of having more than 9 boys out of 15 babies (Hospital 2).

For Hospital 2:
- 60% of 15 babies = 9 boys
- The probability of having more than 9 boys out of 15 babies is lower than the probability of having more than 27 boys out of 45 babies (Hospital 1).

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of the babies being boys.

The answer in the requested format is:
{hospital: 1}
