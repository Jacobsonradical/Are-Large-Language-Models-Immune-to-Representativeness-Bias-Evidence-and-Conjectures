To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the percentage of boys born.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.
- Each hospital recorded the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Assumption:
- We will assume that the percentage of baby boys follows a normal distribution with a mean of 50% and a standard deviation that is small enough to ensure that the percentage of baby boys is above 60% for some days.

Analysis:
- Hospital 1 has a larger number of births per day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15).
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys in a single day is the same for both hospitals, as the percentage of baby boys follows the same distribution.
- However, with a larger sample size (45 births per day) in Hospital 1, the chance of observing more than 60% of baby boys on a given day is higher than in Hospital 2 (15 births per day).

Therefore, we can conclude that:
{hospital: 1}

Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% of baby boys compared to Hospital 2.
