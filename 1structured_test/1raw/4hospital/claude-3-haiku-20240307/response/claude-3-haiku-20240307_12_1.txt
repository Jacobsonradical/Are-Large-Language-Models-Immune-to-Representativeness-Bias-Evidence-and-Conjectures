To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day in each hospital.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but the average is about 50%.

Let's calculate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day for each hospital.

For Hospital 1:
- The expected number of baby boys per day is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5.
- The threshold for more than 60% baby boys is 45 × 0.6 = 27 baby boys.
- The probability of having more than 27 baby boys out of 45 follows a binomial distribution.
- Using the binomial distribution calculator, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in Hospital 1 is around 0.25 or 25%.

For Hospital 2:
- The expected number of baby boys per day is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.
- The threshold for more than 60% baby boys is 15 × 0.6 = 9 baby boys.
- The probability of having more than 9 baby boys out of 15 follows a binomial distribution.
- Using the binomial distribution calculator, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in Hospital 2 is around 0.16 or 16%.

Since the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is higher in Hospital 1 (25%) compared to Hospital 2 (16%), we can expect Hospital 1 to record more such days over the course of a year.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
