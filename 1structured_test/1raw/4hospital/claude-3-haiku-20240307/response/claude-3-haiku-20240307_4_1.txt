To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of boys born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys in a given day.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it is around 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% boys in a given day is the same for both hospitals, as the percentage of boys is independent of the hospital.

However, the number of babies born in each hospital is different, and this affects the number of days where more than 60% of the babies are boys.

Hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born each day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). This means that Hospital 1 has a higher chance of recording more days with more than 60% boys.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 1}
