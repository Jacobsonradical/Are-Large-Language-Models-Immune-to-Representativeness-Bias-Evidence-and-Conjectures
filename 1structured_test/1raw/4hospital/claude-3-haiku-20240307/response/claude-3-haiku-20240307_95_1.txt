To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution and the central limit theorem.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage may vary from day to day.

We are interested in the number of days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Using the central limit theorem, we can approximate the number of boys born in each hospital as a normal distribution with mean 0.5 × total babies and standard deviation sqrt(0.5 × 0.5 × total babies).

For hospital 1, the mean number of boys born per day is 0.5 × 45 = 22.5, and the standard deviation is sqrt(0.5 × 0.5 × 45) = 3.35.
For hospital 2, the mean number of boys born per day is 0.5 × 15 = 7.5, and the standard deviation is sqrt(0.5 × 0.5 × 15) = 1.94.

The probability of having more than 60% boys in a day is the same for both hospitals, as it is based on the standard normal distribution.

However, since hospital 1 has a larger number of births per day, it is more likely to have more days with more than 60% boys.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
