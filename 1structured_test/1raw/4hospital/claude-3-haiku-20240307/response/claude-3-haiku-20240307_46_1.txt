To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it is about 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day is higher for the hospital with fewer babies. This is because the smaller the sample size, the more likely it is to have extreme outcomes (either more than 60% boys or less than 40% boys).

In Hospital 1, with 45 babies born each day, the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day is lower compared to Hospital 2, with 15 babies born each day.

Therefore, we can expect Hospital 2 to have recorded more days with more than 60% boys than Hospital 1.

The answer in the requested format is:

{hospital: 2}
