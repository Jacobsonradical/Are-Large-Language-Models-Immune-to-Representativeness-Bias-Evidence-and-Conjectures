To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it is about 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For Hospital 1:
- Number of babies born per day: 45
- Probability of a baby being a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys:
  - Probability of having 27 or more baby boys out of 45 (60% or more)
  - This probability is approximately 0.1985 or 19.85%

For Hospital 2:
- Number of babies born per day: 15
- Probability of a baby being a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys:
  - Probability of having 10 or more baby boys out of 15 (60% or more)
  - This probability is approximately 0.3008 or 30.08%

Comparing the probabilities, Hospital 2 has a higher probability of recording more days with more than 60% of baby boys.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
