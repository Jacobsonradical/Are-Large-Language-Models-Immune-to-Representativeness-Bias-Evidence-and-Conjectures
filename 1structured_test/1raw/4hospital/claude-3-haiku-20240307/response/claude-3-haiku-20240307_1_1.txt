To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys is around 50%, but it varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys follows a binomial distribution, where the probability of success (having a baby boy) is 0.5 and the number of trials is the number of babies born each day.

For Hospital 1:
- With 45 babies born each day, the number of baby boys follows a binomial distribution with n = 45 and p = 0.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (> 27 baby boys) is approximately 0.2054.
- Over a period of 1 year (365 days), Hospital 1 is expected to record more than 60% of baby boys on approximately 75 days.

For Hospital 2:
- With 15 babies born each day, the number of baby boys follows a binomial distribution with n = 15 and p = 0.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (> 9 baby boys) is approximately 0.2259.
- Over a period of 1 year (365 days), Hospital 2 is expected to record more than 60% of baby boys on approximately 82 days.

Comparison:
Hospital 2 is expected to record more days with more than 60% of baby boys compared to Hospital 1, but the difference is less than 5%.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 3}
