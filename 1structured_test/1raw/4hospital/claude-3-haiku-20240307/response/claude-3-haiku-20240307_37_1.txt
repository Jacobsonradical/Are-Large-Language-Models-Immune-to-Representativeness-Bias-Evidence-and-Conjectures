To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of probability and the variation in the percentage of baby boys.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

We can assume that the number of baby boys and girls follows a binomial distribution, where the probability of a baby being a boy is 0.5.

For a period of 1 year, each hospital recorded the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

The probability of having more than 60% of babies as boys in a given day is:
P(X > 0.6N) = 1 - P(X ≤ 0.6N), where N is the number of babies born in a day.

For hospital 1, N = 45, and for hospital 2, N = 15.

Using the binomial distribution, we can calculate the probability of having more than 60% of babies as boys for each hospital.

Hospital 1:
P(X > 0.6 × 45) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27) = 0.1068

Hospital 2:
P(X > 0.6 × 15) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9) = 0.2220

The probability of having more than 60% of babies as boys is higher for Hospital 2 (0.2220) compared to Hospital 1 (0.1068).

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
