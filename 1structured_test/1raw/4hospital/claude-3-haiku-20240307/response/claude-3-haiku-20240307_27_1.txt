To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of the binomial distribution and its properties.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys is approximately 50%, but it varies from day to day.

The number of baby boys born in a day can be modeled using a binomial distribution with parameters n (number of births) and p (probability of a baby being a boy).

For hospital 1, the number of baby boys born each day follows a binomial distribution with n = 45 and p = 0.5.
For hospital 2, the number of baby boys born each day follows a binomial distribution with n = 15 and p = 0.5.

The probability of having more than 60% of the babies being boys in a day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

Let's calculate the probability of having more than 60% of the babies being boys for each hospital:

Hospital 1:
Probability of having more than 60% of the babies being boys = P(more than 27 boys out of 45 births)
This probability is approximately 0.1026 or 10.26%.

Hospital 2:
Probability of having more than 60% of the babies being boys = P(more than 9 boys out of 15 births)
This probability is approximately 0.2128 or 21.28%.

Since the probability of having more than 60% of the babies being boys is higher for Hospital 2 (21.28%) compared to Hospital 1 (10.26%), Hospital 2 is more likely to record more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 2}
