To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the variation in the percentage of baby boys.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The hospital that is more likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys is the one with a smaller number of babies born each day. This is because with a smaller number of babies, the percentage of baby boys can fluctuate more easily above and below 50%.

Therefore, we can expect that Hospital 2, with about 15 babies born each day, is more likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 1, which has about 45 babies born each day.

The answer in the requested format is:
{hospital: 2}
