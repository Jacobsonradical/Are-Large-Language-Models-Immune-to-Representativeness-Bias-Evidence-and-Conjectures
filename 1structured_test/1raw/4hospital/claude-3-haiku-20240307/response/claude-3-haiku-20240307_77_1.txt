To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution and the probability of having more than 60% boys in a given day.

Given:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys is around 50%, but it varies from day to day.

The number of baby boys born in a day can be modeled as a binomial distribution with parameters n (total number of births) and p (probability of a baby being a boy).

For hospital 1, the probability of having more than 60% boys in a day is:
P(more than 60% boys) = 1 - P(less than or equal to 60% boys)
P(more than 60% boys) = 1 - sum(Binomial(k; 45, 0.5) for k <= 27)

For hospital 2, the probability of having more than 60% boys in a day is:
P(more than 60% boys) = 1 - P(less than or equal to 60% boys)
P(more than 60% boys) = 1 - sum(Binomial(k; 15, 0.5) for k <= 9)

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys is higher for hospital 1 compared to hospital 2, hospital 1 is expected to record more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
