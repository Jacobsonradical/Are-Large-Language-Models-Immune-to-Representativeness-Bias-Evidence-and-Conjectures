To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it is about 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day is the same for both hospitals, as the percentage of baby boys is independent of the hospital.

The binomial distribution can be used to calculate the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day. The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day is approximately 0.2313 (about 23.13%).

Since the probability is the same for both hospitals, the number of days with more than 60% of baby boys born will depend on the number of babies born in each hospital.

Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, so the number of days with more than 60% of baby boys born will be higher than Hospital 2, which has about 15 babies born each day.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 1}
