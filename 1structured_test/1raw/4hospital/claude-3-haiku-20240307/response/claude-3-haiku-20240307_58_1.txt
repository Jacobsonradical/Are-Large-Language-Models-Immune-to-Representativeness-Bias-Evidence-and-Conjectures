To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% of babies born as boys in each hospital.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

Since the exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, we can assume that the number of boys born in a day follows a binomial distribution, with a probability of success (being a boy) of 0.5.

For hospital 1, the number of babies born per day is 45. To have more than 60% of babies as boys, we need at least 27 boys out of 45 babies (60% of 45 is 27).

The probability of having 27 or more boys out of 45 babies can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - P(X < 27)
P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - ∑(26 choose k) * (0.5)^k * (0.5)^(45-k), for k = 0 to 26

For hospital 2, the number of babies born per day is 15. To have more than 60% of babies as boys, we need at least 9 boys out of 15 babies (60% of 15 is 9).

The probability of having 9 or more boys out of 15 babies can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - P(X < 9)
P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - ∑(8 choose k) * (0.5)^k * (0.5)^(15-k), for k = 0 to 8

Since the probability of having more than 60% of babies as boys is higher for hospital 1 (P(X ≥ 27) = 0.0774) compared to hospital 2 (P(X ≥ 9) = 0.0679), hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of babies as boys.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
