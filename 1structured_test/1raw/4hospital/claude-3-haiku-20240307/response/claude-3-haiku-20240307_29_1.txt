To solve this problem, we need to analyze the number of baby boys born in each hospital and the percentage of baby boys.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

To determine which hospital recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the expected number of baby boys born in each hospital per day:
   - Hospital 1: 45 babies × 50% = 22.5 baby boys
   - Hospital 2: 15 babies × 50% = 7.5 baby boys

2. Calculate the minimum number of baby boys needed in each hospital to have more than 60% of the babies born be boys:
   - Hospital 1: 45 babies × 60% = 27 baby boys
   - Hospital 2: 15 babies × 60% = 9 baby boys

3. Compare the expected number of baby boys to the minimum required to have more than 60% of the babies born be boys:
   - Hospital 1: 22.5 baby boys < 27 baby boys required
   - Hospital 2: 7.5 baby boys < 9 baby boys required

Based on the analysis, it is more likely that neither hospital would record more than 60% of the babies born as boys on a given day, as the expected number of baby boys in both hospitals is less than the minimum required.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 3}
