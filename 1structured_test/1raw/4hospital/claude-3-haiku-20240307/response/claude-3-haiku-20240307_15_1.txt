To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of days when more than 60% of the babies born were boys in each hospital.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of baby boys born in each hospital per day.
Hospital 1: 45 babies × 50% = 22.5 baby boys per day
Hospital 2: 15 babies × 50% = 7.5 baby boys per day

Step 2: Calculate the number of days when more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
For hospital 1:
More than 60% of 45 babies = 0.6 × 45 = 27 baby boys
The number of days when more than 27 baby boys were born = Number of days when more than 60% of the babies were boys

For hospital 2:
More than 60% of 15 babies = 0.6 × 15 = 9 baby boys
The number of days when more than 9 baby boys were born = Number of days when more than 60% of the babies were boys

Step 3: Compare the number of days when more than 60% of the babies were boys in each hospital.
If the difference between the two hospitals is within 5%, then they are about the same.

The answer format is: {hospital: your answer}

If hospital 1 recorded more such days: {hospital: 1}
If hospital 2 recorded more such days: {hospital: 2}
If they are about the same (within 5% of each other): {hospital: 3}
