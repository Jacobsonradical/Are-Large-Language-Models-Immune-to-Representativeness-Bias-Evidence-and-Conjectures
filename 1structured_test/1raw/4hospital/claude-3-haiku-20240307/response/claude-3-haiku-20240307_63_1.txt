To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% of the babies born being boys. 

Since the overall percentage of baby boys is around 50%, the probability of having more than 60% of the babies born being boys is relatively low. This probability is the same for both hospitals, as the gender distribution is independent of the hospital.

However, the number of babies born per day is different for the two hospitals, with hospital 1 having about 45 babies born each day and hospital 2 having about 15 babies born each day.

The hospital with the larger number of births per day (hospital 1) is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60% simply due to the larger sample size. The hospital with the smaller number of births per day (hospital 2) is less likely to have such days, as the smaller sample size makes the percentage of baby boys more volatile.

Therefore, I believe that hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
