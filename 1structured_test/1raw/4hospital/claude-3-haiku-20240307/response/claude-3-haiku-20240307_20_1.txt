To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in each hospital.

Given:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it is around 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For hospital 1:
- The average number of baby boys born per day is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys is sqrt(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 3.35.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 27 baby boys) is approximately 0.1587.

For hospital 2:
- The average number of baby boys born per day is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys is sqrt(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 1.93.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 9 baby boys) is approximately 0.1587.

Since the probabilities of having more than 60% of baby boys are the same for both hospitals, we can conclude that they are about the same (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 3}
