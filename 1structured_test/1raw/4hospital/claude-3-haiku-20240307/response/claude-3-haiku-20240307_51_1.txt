To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys on a given day.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

For a period of 1 year, each hospital recorded the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys on a given day follows a binomial distribution. The probability of success (having more than 60% of baby boys) depends on the number of babies born in each hospital.

For Hospital 1, with 45 babies born each day, the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys is higher than for Hospital 2, with 15 babies born each day. This is because the binomial distribution has a higher variance for a larger number of trials (babies born).

Therefore, I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% of baby boys compared to Hospital 2.
