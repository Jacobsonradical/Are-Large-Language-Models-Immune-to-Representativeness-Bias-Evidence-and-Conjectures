To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day.

Given:
- Babies born per day in hospital 1: 45
- Babies born per day in hospital 2: 15
- Percentage of baby boys is around 50%, but can vary.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys in a day can be modeled using the binomial distribution.

For hospital 1:
- Total number of babies per day: 45
- Probability of having a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys = P(X > 27), where X follows a binomial distribution with n = 45 and p = 0.5.

For hospital 2:
- Total number of babies per day: 15
- Probability of having a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys = P(X > 9), where X follows a binomial distribution with n = 15 and p = 0.5.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys is higher for hospital 1 than hospital 2, as the number of babies born per day is higher in hospital 1.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 1}
