To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of more than 60% of the babies born being boys in each hospital.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

For a day to be recorded, more than 60% of the babies born must be boys. This means that the probability of a day being recorded is the probability of getting more than 60% boys in the births for that day.

Let's consider the two hospitals separately:

Hospital 1:
- The expected number of boys born each day is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of boys born each day is √(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 3.36.
- The probability of getting more than 60% boys in the births for a day is approximately 0.159 (using the normal distribution approximation).

Hospital 2:
- The expected number of boys born each day is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of boys born each day is √(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 1.93.
- The probability of getting more than 60% boys in the births for a day is approximately 0.089 (using the normal distribution approximation).

The probability of getting more than 60% boys in the births is higher for Hospital 1 than for Hospital 2. Therefore, Hospital 1 is expected to record more such days than Hospital 2.
