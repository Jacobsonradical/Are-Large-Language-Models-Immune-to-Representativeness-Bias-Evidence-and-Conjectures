To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys for each hospital, and then compare them.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys.

Step 1: Calculate the expected number of baby boys born per day for each hospital.
Expected number of baby boys per day in Hospital 1 = 45 × 0.5 = 22.5
Expected number of baby boys per day in Hospital 2 = 15 × 0.5 = 7.5

Step 2: Calculate the threshold for more than 60% of the babies to be boys.
Threshold for more than 60% boys in Hospital 1 = 45 × 0.6 = 27 baby boys
Threshold for more than 60% boys in Hospital 2 = 15 × 0.6 = 9 baby boys

Step 3: Calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day for each hospital.
Probability of having more than 60% boys in Hospital 1 = 1 - P(X ≤ 26) = 1 - 0.6915 = 0.3085
Probability of having more than 60% boys in Hospital 2 = 1 - P(X ≤ 8) = 1 - 0.4975 = 0.5025

Step 4: Calculate the expected number of days with more than 60% boys for each hospital.
Expected number of days with more than 60% boys in Hospital 1 = 365 × 0.3085 = 112.6
Expected number of days with more than 60% boys in Hospital 2 = 365 × 0.5025 = 183.4

Based on the calculations, Hospital 2 is expected to record more days with more than 60% of the babies being boys.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
{hospital: 2}
