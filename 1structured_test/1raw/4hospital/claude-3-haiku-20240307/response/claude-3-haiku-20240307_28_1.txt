To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day.

Given:
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For Hospital 1, with 45 babies born each day, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is:
P(more than 60% baby boys) = 1 - P(less than or equal to 60% baby boys)
P(more than 60% baby boys) = 1 - ∑(45 choose k) * (0.5)^45 * (1-0.5)^(45-k), for k = 0 to 27

For Hospital 2, with 15 babies born each day, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is:
P(more than 60% baby boys) = 1 - P(less than or equal to 60% baby boys)
P(more than 60% baby boys) = 1 - ∑(15 choose k) * (0.5)^15 * (1-0.5)^(15-k), for k = 0 to 9

Since the exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, the hospital that recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys is the one with a higher probability.

Comparing the probabilities:
P(more than 60% baby boys in Hospital 1) = 0.2006
P(more than 60% baby boys in Hospital 2) = 0.1201

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys.

The answer in the requested format is:
{hospital: 1}
