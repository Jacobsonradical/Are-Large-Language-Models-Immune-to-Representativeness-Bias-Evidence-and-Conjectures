To solve this problem, we need to consider the variation in the percentage of baby boys born each day and the number of babies born in each hospital.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

Since the percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, it is possible that there will be days when more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

To determine which hospital is likely to record more such days, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital.

Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day. This means that Hospital 1 has a larger sample size, and therefore, it is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of babies born being boys.

Therefore, my answer is:
{hospital: 1}
