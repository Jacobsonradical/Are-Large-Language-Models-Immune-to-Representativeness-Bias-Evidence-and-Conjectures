To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of having more than 60% baby boys born in a day at each hospital and compare the number of days when this occurs.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys born in a day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For hospital 1:
- Number of babies born per day: 45
- Probability of a baby being a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% baby boys (>27 baby boys) = 1 - P(≤27 baby boys)

Similarly, for hospital 2:
- Number of babies born per day: 15
- Probability of a baby being a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% baby boys (>9 baby boys) = 1 - P(≤9 baby boys)

Comparing the probabilities for each hospital:
- Hospital 1 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys born in a day.
- This means that hospital 1 is likely to record more days with more than 60% baby boys born.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
