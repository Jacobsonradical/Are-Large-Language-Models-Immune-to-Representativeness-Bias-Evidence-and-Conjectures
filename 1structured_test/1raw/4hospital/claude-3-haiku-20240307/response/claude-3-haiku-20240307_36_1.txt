To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% boys born in a day at each hospital.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but the overall percentage of baby boys is about 50%.

For a baby to be considered a "more than 60% boys" day, the number of boys born must be greater than 60% of the total number of babies born.

Let's calculate the expected number of boys born on a given day at each hospital:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies × 50% = 22.5 boys
- Hospital 2: 15 babies × 50% = 7.5 boys

To have more than 60% boys, the number of boys born must be greater than 60% of the total number of babies born.

For Hospital 1:
- 60% of 45 babies = 27 boys
- Since the expected number of boys is 22.5, which is less than 27, the probability of having more than 60% boys is lower.

For Hospital 2:
- 60% of 15 babies = 9 boys
- Since the expected number of boys is 7.5, which is less than 9, the probability of having more than 60% boys is higher.

Therefore, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys born.
