To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% of the babies being boys.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, with an average of 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% of the babies being boys follows a binomial distribution, with a success probability of 0.5 (50% chance of a boy) and the number of trials equal to the number of babies born each day.

For Hospital 1:
The number of babies born each day is 45. The probability of having more than 60% of the babies being boys can be calculated as:
P(X > 0.6 × 45) = 1 - P(X ≤ 0.6 × 45)
This probability can be calculated using a binomial distribution calculator or a normal approximation.

For Hospital 2:
The number of babies born each day is 15. The probability of having more than 60% of the babies being boys can be calculated similarly:
P(X > 0.6 × 15) = 1 - P(X ≤ 0.6 × 15)

Since the probability of having more than 60% of the babies being boys is higher for a larger number of babies (Hospital 1), it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
