To solve this problem, we need to analyze the likelihood of having more than 60% of babies born as boys in each hospital.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it is around 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% of babies born as boys follows a binomial distribution, with the probability of success (being a boy) being around 0.5.

For Hospital 1, with an average of 45 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% of babies born as boys is higher compared to Hospital 2, which has an average of 15 babies born per day.

The reason for this is that with a larger sample size (45 babies), the distribution of the percentage of baby boys is more likely to deviate from the mean (50%) and have a higher or lower percentage, whereas with a smaller sample size (15 babies), the distribution is more likely to be closer to the mean.

Therefore, I believe that Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of babies born as boys compared to Hospital 2.
