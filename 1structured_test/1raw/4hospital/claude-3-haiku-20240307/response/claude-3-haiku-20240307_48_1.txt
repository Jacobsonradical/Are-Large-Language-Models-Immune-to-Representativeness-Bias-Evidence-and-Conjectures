To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% boys in a single day is the same for both hospitals, as the gender distribution is the same. However, the number of babies born in each hospital is different, which can affect the number of days when more than 60% of the babies are boys.

Hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born each day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15). This means that Hospital 1 has a higher chance of recording more days when more than 60% of the babies are boys.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 1}
