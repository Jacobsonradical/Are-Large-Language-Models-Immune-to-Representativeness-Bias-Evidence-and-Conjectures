To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the variation in the percentage of baby boys.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- On average, 50% of all babies are boys.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, and can be higher or lower than 50%.

The question asks which hospital recorded more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Since the percentage of baby boys can vary from day to day, the hospital with a larger number of babies born each day is more likely to have more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.

Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day, while Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day. Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to have more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.

Thus, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
