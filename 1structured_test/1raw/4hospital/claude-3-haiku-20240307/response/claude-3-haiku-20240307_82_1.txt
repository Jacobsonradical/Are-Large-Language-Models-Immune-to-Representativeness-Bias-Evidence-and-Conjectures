To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% of boys born on a given day.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but the average is around 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% of boys born on a given day is higher for Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2 because of the larger number of births.

In Hospital 1, the expected number of boys born per day is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5. For more than 60% of the babies to be boys, the number of boys should be greater than 0.6 × 45 = 27. This means that on days when the number of boys is between 27 and 45, Hospital 1 will record a day with more than 60% of babies being boys.

In Hospital 2, the expected number of boys born per day is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5. For more than 60% of the babies to be boys, the number of boys should be greater than 0.6 × 15 = 9. This means that on days when the number of boys is between 9 and 15, Hospital 2 will record a day with more than 60% of babies being boys.

Based on the above analysis, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of babies being boys compared to Hospital 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
