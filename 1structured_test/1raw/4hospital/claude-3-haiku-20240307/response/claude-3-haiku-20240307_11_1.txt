To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of baby boys born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys on a given day.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The number of baby boys born in each hospital on a given day can be modeled using a binomial distribution with parameters n (total number of births) and p (probability of a baby being a boy).

For hospital 1:
- Total number of births (n) = 45
- Probability of a baby being a boy (p) = 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys = 1 - P(X ≤ 27) = 0.2632

For hospital 2:
- Total number of births (n) = 15
- Probability of a baby being a boy (p) = 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys = 1 - P(X ≤ 9) = 0.2881

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys is slightly higher for hospital 2 (28.81%) compared to hospital 1 (26.32%). This means that hospital 2 is likely to record more days with more than 60% of baby boys.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
