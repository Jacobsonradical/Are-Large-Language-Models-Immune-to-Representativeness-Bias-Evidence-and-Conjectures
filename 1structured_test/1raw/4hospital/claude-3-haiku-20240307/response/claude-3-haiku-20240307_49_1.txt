To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- On average, 50% of all babies are boys.

The probability of having more than 60% boys in a given day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For hospital 1, the probability of having more than 60% boys can be calculated as:
P(more than 60% boys) = 1 - P(less than or equal to 60% boys)
P(more than 60% boys) = 1 - [P(27 or fewer boys) + P(28 boys) + P(29 boys)]

For hospital 2, the probability of having more than 60% boys can be calculated as:
P(more than 60% boys) = 1 - P(less than or equal to 60% boys)
P(more than 60% boys) = 1 - [P(9 or fewer boys) + P(10 boys) + P(11 boys)]

Assuming the probability of having more than 60% boys is the same for both hospitals, hospital 1 has a higher chance of recording more such days due to the larger number of babies born each day.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 1}
