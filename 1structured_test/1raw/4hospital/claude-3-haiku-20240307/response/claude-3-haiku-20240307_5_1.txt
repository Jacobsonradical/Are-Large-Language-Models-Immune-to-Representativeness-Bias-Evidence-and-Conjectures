To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys.

The probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day follows a binomial distribution. We can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys for each hospital.

For hospital 1:
- Number of babies born per day: 45
- Probability of a baby being a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% boys (> 27 boys) = 0.2615

For hospital 2:
- Number of babies born per day: 15
- Probability of a baby being a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% boys (> 9 boys) = 0.2209

The probability of having more than 60% boys is slightly higher for hospital 1 (0.2615) compared to hospital 2 (0.2209). However, the difference is not significant (within 5%).

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 3}
