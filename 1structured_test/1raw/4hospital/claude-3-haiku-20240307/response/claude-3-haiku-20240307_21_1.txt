To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it is about 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day follows a binomial distribution. The probability of having more than 60% boys can be calculated using the binomial probability formula.

For hospital 1:
- Number of babies born per day: 45
- Probability of a baby being a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% boys (>27 boys) = 0.1436

For hospital 2:
- Number of babies born per day: 15
- Probability of a baby being a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% boys (>9 boys) = 0.1026

The probability of having more than 60% boys is higher for hospital 1 than for hospital 2. Therefore, hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys.
