To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys follows a binomial distribution, where the number of trials (births) and the probability of success (having a boy) can be used to determine the likelihood of observing more than 60% baby boys.

The binomial distribution has the following formula:
P(X > 0.6n) = 1 - âˆ‘(i=0 to 0.6n-1) (n choose i) * (0.5)^n

Where:
- P(X > 0.6n) is the probability of having more than 60% baby boys
- n is the number of births
- i is the number of baby boys

Considering the number of births in each hospital, we have:
- For hospital 1, n = 45 births per day
- For hospital 2, n = 15 births per day

Calculating the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in each hospital:
- Hospital 1: P(X > 0.6 * 45) = 0.4739
- Hospital 2: P(X > 0.6 * 15) = 0.3264

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys is higher in hospital 1 than in hospital 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
