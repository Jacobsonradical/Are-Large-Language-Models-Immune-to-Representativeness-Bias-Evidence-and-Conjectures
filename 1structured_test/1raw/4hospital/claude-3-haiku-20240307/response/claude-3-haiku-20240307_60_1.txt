To solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

1. The total number of babies born per day in both hospitals:
   - Hospital 1: 45 babies
   - Hospital 2: 15 babies
   - Total: 45 + 15 = 60 babies

2. The expected number of baby boys born per day:
   - Since about 50% of all babies are boys, the expected number of baby boys born per day is 50% of the total, which is 0.5 Ã— 60 = 30 baby boys.

3. The condition for recording a day: more than 60% of the babies born were boys.
   - This means that on a given day, the number of baby boys born must be greater than 60% of the total number of babies born.
   - The minimum number of baby boys required to meet this condition is 60% of 60, which is 36 baby boys.

Now, let's consider each hospital separately:

Hospital 1:
- On average, 45 babies are born per day.
- To have more than 60% of these babies be boys, the minimum number of baby boys required is 36.
- The probability of having 36 or more baby boys out of 45 total babies is higher than the probability of having 36 or more baby boys out of 15 total babies (in Hospital 2).

Hospital 2:
- On average, 15 babies are born per day.
- To have more than 60% of these babies be boys, the minimum number of baby boys required is also 36.
- The probability of having 36 or more baby boys out of 15 total babies is lower than the probability of having 36 or more baby boys out of 45 total babies (in Hospital 1).

Therefore, we can conclude that Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

The answer in the requested format is:

{hospital: 1}
