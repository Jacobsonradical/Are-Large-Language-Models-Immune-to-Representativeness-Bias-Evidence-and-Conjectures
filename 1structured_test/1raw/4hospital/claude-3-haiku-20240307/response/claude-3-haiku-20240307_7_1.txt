To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of having more than 60% boys born in a day.

Since the overall probability of having a boy is 50%, the probability of having more than 60% boys in a day follows a binomial distribution.

For hospital 1, which has 45 births per day, the expected number of boys per day is 22.5. The probability of having more than 60% boys, which is 27 boys or more, can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For hospital 2, which has 15 births per day, the expected number of boys per day is 7.5. The probability of having more than 60% boys, which is 9 boys or more, can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

By comparing the probabilities for each hospital, we can determine which hospital is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys.
