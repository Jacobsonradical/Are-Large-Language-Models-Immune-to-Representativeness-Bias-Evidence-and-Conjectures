To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born at each hospital and the variation in the percentage of baby boys.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The key factor is the number of babies born at each hospital. Since Hospital 1 has a larger number of births, it is more likely to have days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.

Assuming the variation in the percentage of baby boys is similar at both hospitals, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days where the percentage of baby boys is above 60%.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
