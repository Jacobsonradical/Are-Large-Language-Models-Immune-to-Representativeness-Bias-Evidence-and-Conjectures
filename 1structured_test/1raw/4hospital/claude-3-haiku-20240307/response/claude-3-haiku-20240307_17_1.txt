To solve this problem, we need to consider the expected number of baby boys born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys on a given day.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but the overall percentage is about 50%.

Expected number of baby boys born per day:
- Hospital 1: 45 × 0.5 = 22.5 baby boys
- Hospital 2: 15 × 0.5 = 7.5 baby boys

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys on a given day is the same for both hospitals, as the overall percentage of baby boys is about 50%.

To determine which hospital recorded more days with more than 60% of baby boys, we need to consider the total number of days in a year (365) and the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys on a given day.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys on a given day is the probability of having 61% or more baby boys, which can be calculated using the binomial distribution:

P(more than 60% baby boys) = 1 - P(60% or less baby boys)
P(more than 60% baby boys) = 1 - (0.5^n * binomial coefficient(n, 0.6n))

where n is the number of babies born per day in each hospital.

For hospital 1, n = 45, and for hospital 2, n = 15.

Calculating the probability for each hospital:
- Hospital 1: P(more than 60% baby boys) = 0.2234
- Hospital 2: P(more than 60% baby boys) = 0.1003

The expected number of days with more than 60% of baby boys in a year:
- Hospital 1: 365 × 0.2234 = 81.54 days
- Hospital 2: 365 × 0.1003 = 36.61 days

Since the expected number of days with more than 60% of baby boys is higher for hospital 1 (81.54 days) compared to hospital 2 (36.61 days), we can conclude that hospital 1 recorded more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 1}
