To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of having more than 60% of babies born as boys in each hospital.

Given:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% of babies born as boys follows a binomial distribution. The probability of success (having more than 60% of babies as boys) is calculated as follows:

Probability of success = 1 - Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the binomial distribution with 50% probability of success and the number of babies born in each hospital.

For hospital 1 (45 babies per day):
Probability of having more than 60% of babies as boys = 1 - CDF(0.6, 45, 0.5) = 0.1469

For hospital 2 (15 babies per day):
Probability of having more than 60% of babies as boys = 1 - CDF(0.6, 15, 0.5) = 0.2529

Since the probability is higher for hospital 2, it is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of babies born as boys.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
