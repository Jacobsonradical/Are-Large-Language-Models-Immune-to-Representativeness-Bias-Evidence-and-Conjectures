To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probability of having more than 60% baby boys born in each hospital.

Given:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, with an average of 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a given day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For hospital 1:
- With an average of 45 babies per day, the expected number of baby boys is 0.5 × 45 = 22.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys is √(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 3.75.
- The probability of having more than 60% baby boys (more than 27 baby boys) is approximately 0.13 or 13%.

For hospital 2:
- With an average of 15 babies per day, the expected number of baby boys is 0.5 × 15 = 7.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys is √(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 1.93.
- The probability of having more than 60% baby boys (more than 9 baby boys) is approximately 0.12 or 12%.

Since the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is slightly higher for hospital 1 (13%) compared to hospital 2 (12%), hospital 1 is more likely to record more such days during the year.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
