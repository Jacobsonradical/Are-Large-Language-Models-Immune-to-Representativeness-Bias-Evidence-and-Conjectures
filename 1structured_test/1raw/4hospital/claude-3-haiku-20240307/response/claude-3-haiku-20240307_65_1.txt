To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the fluctuations in the percentage of baby boys.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- On average, 50% of all babies are boys.

The key factor in this problem is the threshold of more than 60% of babies being boys. Since the exact percentage varies from day to day, both hospitals have an equal chance of recording more days with more than 60% baby boys.

However, since Hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born each day, it has a higher probability of recording more days with more than 60% baby boys. This is because the larger the sample size (number of babies), the more likely it is to observe a significant deviation from the average of 50%.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 1}
