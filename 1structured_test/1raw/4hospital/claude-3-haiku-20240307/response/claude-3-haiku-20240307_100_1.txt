To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day at each hospital.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage can vary from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For Hospital 1:
- The expected number of baby boys born per day is 0.5 × 45 = 22.5.
- The standard deviation is sqrt(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 3.75.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 27 boys) in a day is approximately 0.1587 or 15.87%.

For Hospital 2:
- The expected number of baby boys born per day is 0.5 × 15 = 7.5.
- The standard deviation is sqrt(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 1.93.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 9 boys) in a day is approximately 0.2389 or 23.89%.

Comparing the probabilities, Hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of baby boys born.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
