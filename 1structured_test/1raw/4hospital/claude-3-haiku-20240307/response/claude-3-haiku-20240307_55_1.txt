To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expected number of days when more than 60% of the babies born are boys in each hospital.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- On average, 50% of all babies are boys.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, and can be higher or lower than 50%.

Assumption:
- We assume that the daily variation in the percentage of baby boys follows a normal distribution with a mean of 50% and a standard deviation that is small enough to ensure that the percentage of baby boys is within the range of 40% to 60% for the majority of the days.

Analysis:
1. Hospital 1:
   - With 45 babies born each day, the expected number of baby boys is 22.5 (45 × 0.5).
   - The standard deviation of the number of baby boys is √(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 3.34.
   - The probability of having more than 60% of the babies as boys (27 or more) is approximately 0.1587 (using the normal distribution).
   - Over a period of 1 year (365 days), the expected number of days when more than 60% of the babies are boys is 0.1587 × 365 = 57.93 days.

2. Hospital 2:
   - With 15 babies born each day, the expected number of baby boys is 7.5 (15 × 0.5).
   - The standard deviation of the number of baby boys is √(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 1.93.
   - The probability of having more than 60% of the babies as boys (9 or more) is approximately 0.2123 (using the normal distribution).
   - Over a period of 1 year (365 days), the expected number of days when more than 60% of the babies are boys is 0.2123 × 365 = 77.49 days.

Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, hospital 2 is expected to record more days when more than 60% of the babies born are boys compared to hospital 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
