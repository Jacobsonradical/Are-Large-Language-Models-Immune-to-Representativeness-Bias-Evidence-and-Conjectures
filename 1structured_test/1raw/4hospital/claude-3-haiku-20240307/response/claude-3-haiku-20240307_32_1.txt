To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution and the probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% boys born on a given day can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula.

Let's assume that the probability of having a boy is 0.5 (50%).

For Hospital 1:
- Number of babies born per day: 45
- Probability of having more than 60% boys (> 27 boys): 0.1611

For Hospital 1, the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day is 0.1611, which is higher than Hospital 2.

For Hospital 2:
- Number of babies born per day: 15
- Probability of having more than 60% boys (> 9 boys): 0.1172

For Hospital 2, the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day is 0.1172, which is lower than Hospital 1.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is expected to record more days with more than 60% boys than Hospital 2.

Answer:
{hospital: 1}
