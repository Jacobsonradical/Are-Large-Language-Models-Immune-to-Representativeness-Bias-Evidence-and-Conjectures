To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born on a given day.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but the overall average is about 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born on a given day follows a binomial distribution.

For Hospital 1:
- With an average of 45 babies born per day, the expected number of baby boys is 22.5 (45 × 0.5).
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys is √(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 3.35.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 27 boys) on a given day is approximately 0.11 or 11%.

For Hospital 2:
- With an average of 15 babies born per day, the expected number of baby boys is 7.5 (15 × 0.5).
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys is √(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 1.93.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 9 boys) on a given day is approximately 0.16 or 16%.

Based on the calculations, Hospital 2 has a higher probability of recording more days with more than 60% of baby boys born.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
