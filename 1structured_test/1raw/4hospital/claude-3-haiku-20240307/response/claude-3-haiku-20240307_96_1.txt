To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution and its properties.

Since the probability of a baby being a boy is approximately 50%, we can model the number of baby boys born in each hospital as a binomial random variable.

The number of baby boys born in hospital 1 each day follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 45 (total babies) and p = 0.5 (probability of a baby being a boy).

The number of baby boys born in hospital 2 each day follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 15 (total babies) and p = 0.5 (probability of a baby being a boy).

Now, we need to find the number of days when more than 60% of the babies born were boys in each hospital.

For hospital 1:
The number of baby boys required to be more than 60% of 45 babies is 27 or more.
The probability of having 27 or more baby boys out of 45 births is:
P(X ≥ 27) = 1 - P(X ≤ 26) = 1 - 0.6412 = 0.3588

This means that hospital 1 is expected to record more than 60% baby boys on about 36% of the days.

For hospital 2:
The number of baby boys required to be more than 60% of 15 babies is 10 or more.
The probability of having 10 or more baby boys out of 15 births is:
P(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9) = 1 - 0.7031 = 0.2969

This means that hospital 2 is expected to record more than 60% baby boys on about 30% of the days.

Since 36% is greater than 30%, we can conclude that:

{hospital: 1}
