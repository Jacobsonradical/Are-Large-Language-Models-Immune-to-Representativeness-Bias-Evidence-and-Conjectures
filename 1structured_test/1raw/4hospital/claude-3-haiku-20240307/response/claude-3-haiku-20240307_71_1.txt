To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, and it is sometimes higher than 50%, sometimes lower.

The probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day follows a binomial distribution with a probability of success (having a boy) of 0.5.

For hospital 1, the expected number of boys born per day is 0.5 × 45 = 22.5 boys.
The probability of having more than 60% boys (more than 27 boys) in a sample of 45 babies is approximately 0.1859.

For hospital 2, the expected number of boys born per day is 0.5 × 15 = 7.5 boys.
The probability of having more than 60% boys (more than 9 boys) in a sample of 15 babies is approximately 0.2090.

The probability of having more than 60% boys is slightly higher for hospital 2 than for hospital 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
