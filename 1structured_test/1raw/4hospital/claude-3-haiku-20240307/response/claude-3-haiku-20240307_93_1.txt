To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of a baby being a boy and the number of babies born in each hospital.

Given:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of a baby being a boy is approximately 0.5 (50%), but the exact percentage can be higher or lower on any given day.

To have more than 60% of the babies born as boys, the number of boy babies should be more than 60% of the total number of babies born on that day.

For hospital 1:
- Total number of babies born per day: 45
- Number of boy babies required to be more than 60%: 0.6 × 45 = 27

For hospital 2:
- Total number of babies born per day: 15
- Number of boy babies required to be more than 60%: 0.6 × 15 = 9

Since hospital 1 has a higher number of babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% of the babies as boys is higher compared to hospital 2.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 1}
