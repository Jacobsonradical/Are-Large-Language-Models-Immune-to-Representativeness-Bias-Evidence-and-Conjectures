To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has around 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has around 15 babies born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys is around 50%, but it can vary from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a given day follows a binomial distribution with a probability of success (having a baby boy) of 0.5.

For Hospital 1, with 45 babies born each day, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is higher than for Hospital 2, with only 15 babies born each day. This is because with a larger sample size (45 babies), the probability of deviating from the expected 50% is lower.

Therefore, I think Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 2.
