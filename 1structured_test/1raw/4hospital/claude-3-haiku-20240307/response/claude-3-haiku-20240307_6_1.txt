To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distribution of the number of baby boys born in each hospital.

Given:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The number of baby boys born in each hospital follows a binomial distribution with parameter p = 0.5 (50% probability of a baby being a boy).

The probability of more than 60% of the babies being boys in a given day is:
P(X > 0.6n) = 1 - P(X ≤ 0.6n), where n is the total number of babies born in the hospital and X is the number of baby boys.

For hospital 1, with an average of 45 babies born per day, the probability of more than 60% of the babies being boys is:
P(X > 0.6 × 45) = 1 - P(X ≤ 27) = 0.2634

For hospital 2, with an average of 15 babies born per day, the probability of more than 60% of the babies being boys is:
P(X > 0.6 × 15) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9) = 0.1874

Since the probability of more than 60% of the babies being boys is higher for hospital 1 (26.34%) than for hospital 2 (18.74%), we can conclude that hospital 1 is more likely to record more such days over a period of 1 year.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
