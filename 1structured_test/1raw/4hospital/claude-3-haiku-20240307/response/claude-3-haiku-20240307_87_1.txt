To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of baby boys born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys on a given day.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys.

For hospital 1:
- With 45 babies born each day, the expected number of baby boys is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (i.e., more than 27 baby boys) is higher than for hospital 2 due to the larger sample size.

For hospital 2:
- With 15 babies born each day, the expected number of baby boys is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (i.e., more than 9 baby boys) is lower than for hospital 1 due to the smaller sample size.

Considering the above, hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of baby boys.
