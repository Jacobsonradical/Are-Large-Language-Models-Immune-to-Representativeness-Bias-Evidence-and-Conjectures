To solve this problem, we need to consider the expected number of days when more than 60% of the babies born are boys in each hospital.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys.

The expected number of baby boys born in a day can be calculated as follows:
- Hospital 1: 45 × 0.5 = 22.5 baby boys
- Hospital 2: 15 × 0.5 = 7.5 baby boys

The number of days when more than 60% of the babies born are boys can be calculated as follows:
- Hospital 1: On a given day, if more than 60% of the 45 babies are boys, that means more than 27 babies are boys.
- Hospital 2: On a given day, if more than 60% of the 15 babies are boys, that means more than 9 babies are boys.

The probability of the number of baby boys exceeding the above thresholds can be calculated using the binomial distribution. However, without performing a detailed statistical analysis, we can make a reasonable estimate.

Given that the expected percentage of baby boys is 50%, and the threshold is 60%, it is more likely that Hospital 1 will record more days with more than 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 2. This is because Hospital 1 has a larger sample size (45 babies per day) compared to Hospital 2 (15 babies per day), and the variation in the percentage of baby boys is expected to be smaller in the larger sample.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
