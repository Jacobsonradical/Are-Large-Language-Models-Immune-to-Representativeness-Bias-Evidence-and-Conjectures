To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the possibility of the percentage of baby boys being higher or lower than 50%.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, and can be higher or lower than 50%.

For a period of 1 year, each hospital recorded the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Since the number of babies born in Hospital 1 is significantly higher than Hospital 2, it is more likely that Hospital 1 will have more days where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

The probability of having more than 60% boys in a day is lower for Hospital 2 due to the smaller number of babies born.

Therefore, my answer is:

{hospital: 1}
