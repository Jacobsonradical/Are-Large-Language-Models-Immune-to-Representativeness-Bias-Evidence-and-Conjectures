To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in each hospital.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys is 50% on average, but it varies from day to day.

For a 60% or higher percentage of baby boys, the number of baby boys should be more than 60% of the total number of babies born.

Hospital 1:
- With 45 babies born per day, the number of baby boys needed to be more than 60% is 27 or more.
- The probability of having 27 or more baby boys out of 45 babies is higher than the probability of having 8 or more baby boys out of 15 babies in Hospital 2.

Hospital 2:
- With 15 babies born per day, the number of baby boys needed to be more than 60% is 9 or more.
- The probability of having 9 or more baby boys out of 15 babies is lower than the probability of having 27 or more baby boys out of 45 babies in Hospital 1.

Therefore, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of baby boys.
