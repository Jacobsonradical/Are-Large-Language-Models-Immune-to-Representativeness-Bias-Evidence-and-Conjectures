To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution and use it to estimate the number of days when more than 60% of the babies born were boys in each hospital.

Assumptions:
1. The gender of each baby is independent and follows a binomial distribution with a probability of 0.5 for being a boy.
2. The number of babies born each day in each hospital follows a Poisson distribution.

Step 1: Calculate the expected number of baby boys born each day in each hospital.
Hospital 1: 45 babies × 0.5 = 22.5 baby boys
Hospital 2: 15 babies × 0.5 = 7.5 baby boys

Step 2: Calculate the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys in a single day for each hospital.
For Hospital 1:
Number of baby boys required to be more than 60% of 45 babies = 0.6 × 45 = 27 baby boys
Using the binomial distribution, the probability of having 27 or more baby boys out of 45 births is approximately 0.2573.

For Hospital 2:
Number of baby boys required to be more than 60% of 15 babies = 0.6 × 15 = 9 baby boys
Using the binomial distribution, the probability of having 9 or more baby boys out of 15 births is approximately 0.3554.

Step 3: Estimate the number of days in a year when more than 60% of the babies born were boys in each hospital.
Hospital 1: 365 days × 0.2573 = 93.92 days
Hospital 2: 365 days × 0.3554 = 129.72 days

Based on the calculations, hospital 2 is likely to record more days when more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
