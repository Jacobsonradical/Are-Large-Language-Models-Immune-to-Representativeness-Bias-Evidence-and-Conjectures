To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probability of having more than 60% baby boys being born in each hospital.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys born in a day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For Hospital 1:
- Number of births per day: 45
- Probability of a baby being a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% baby boys (>27 boys out of 45 births) = 0.1413

For Hospital 2:
- Number of births per day: 15
- Probability of a baby being a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% baby boys (>9 boys out of 15 births) = 0.2266

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys is higher for Hospital 2 than for Hospital 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
