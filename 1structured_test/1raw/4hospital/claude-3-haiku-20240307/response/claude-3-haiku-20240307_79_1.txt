To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of having more than 60% baby boys born in a day for each hospital and then compare the number of days where this occurred.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

For hospital 1:
The expected number of baby boys born per day is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5.
The number of baby boys required to have more than 60% of the total births is 45 × 0.6 = 27.

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a day can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
P(X ≥ 27) = ∑(45 choose k) × (0.5)^k × (0.5)^(45-k), where k ≥ 27

For hospital 2:
The expected number of baby boys born per day is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.
The number of baby boys required to have more than 60% of the total births is 15 × 0.6 = 9.

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a day can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
P(X ≥ 9) = ∑(15 choose k) × (0.5)^k × (0.5)^(15-k), where k ≥ 9

Comparing the probabilities, hospital 2 has a higher probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a day.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
