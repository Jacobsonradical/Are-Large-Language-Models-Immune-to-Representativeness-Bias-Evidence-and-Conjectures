To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of days when more than 60% of the babies born were boys in each hospital.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

Since the exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, we can assume that the number of days when more than 60% of the babies born were boys would be similar for both hospitals, as long as the number of births per day is significantly large.

However, the key difference is the number of babies born per day in each hospital. Hospital 1 has a larger number of births per day (45) compared to hospital 2 (15). This means that hospital 1 is more likely to have a larger number of days when more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
