To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of having more than 60% of the babies born as boys in each hospital.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% of the babies born as boys follows a binomial distribution.

For hospital 1, the expected number of boys born per day is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5. The probability of having more than 60% of the 45 babies born as boys is:
P(more than 27 boys) = 1 - P(0 boys) - P(1 boy) - P(2 boys) - ... - P(27 boys) = 0.2967

For hospital 2, the expected number of boys born per day is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5. The probability of having more than 60% of the 15 babies born as boys is:
P(more than 9 boys) = 1 - P(0 boys) - P(1 boy) - P(2 boys) - ... - P(9 boys) = 0.2946

The probability of having more than 60% of the babies born as boys is slightly higher in hospital 1 (29.67%) compared to hospital 2 (29.46%), which is a difference of less than 5%.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 3}
