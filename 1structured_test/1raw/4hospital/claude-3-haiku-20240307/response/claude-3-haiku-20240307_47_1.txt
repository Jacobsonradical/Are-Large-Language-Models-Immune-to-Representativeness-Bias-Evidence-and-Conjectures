To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the variation in the percentage of baby boys.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- On average, about 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

Let's calculate the number of baby boys born in each hospital on a day when more than 60% of the babies are boys:

Hospital 1:
- Total babies born: 45
- Percentage of baby boys: More than 60%
- Number of baby boys: 45 × 0.60 = 27 or more

Hospital 2:
- Total babies born: 15
- Percentage of baby boys: More than 60%
- Number of baby boys: 15 × 0.60 = 9 or more

Since hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born each day, it is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of the babies being boys.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
