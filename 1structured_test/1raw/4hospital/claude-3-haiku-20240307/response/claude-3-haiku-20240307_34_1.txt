To solve this problem, we need to consider the daily variation in the percentage of baby boys born in each hospital.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, sometimes higher than 50% and sometimes lower.

Assuming that the percentage of baby boys follows a normal distribution with a mean of 50%, we can calculate the probability of having more than 60% of babies being boys in each hospital.

For Hospital 1:
- The standard deviation of the percentage of baby boys is approximately √(0.5 × 0.5 / 45) ≈ 0.0745.
- The probability of having more than 60% of babies being boys is 1 - Φ((60% - 50%) / 0.0745) ≈ 0.1056, where Φ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.
- This means that Hospital 1 would record such days approximately 10.56% of the time, or about 38.5 days in a year.

For Hospital 2:
- The standard deviation of the percentage of baby boys is approximately √(0.5 × 0.5 / 15) ≈ 0.1291.
- The probability of having more than 60% of babies being boys is 1 - Φ((60% - 50%) / 0.1291) ≈ 0.1056, which is the same as Hospital 1.
- This means that Hospital 2 would record such days approximately 10.56% of the time, or about 38.5 days in a year.

Since the probabilities are the same for both hospitals, they are likely to record about the same number of days (within 5% of each other) where more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 3}
