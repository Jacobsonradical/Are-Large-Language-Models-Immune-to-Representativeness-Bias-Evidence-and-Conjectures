To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of days when more than 60% of the babies born are boys for each hospital.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

Since the exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, we can assume that the number of baby boys follows a binomial distribution with a probability of success (being a boy) of 0.5.

For hospital 1:
- The expected number of baby boys born per day is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys is √(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 3.35.
- The probability of having more than 60% of the babies born as boys is approximately 0.2313 (calculated using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution).
- Assuming 365 days in a year, the expected number of days with more than 60% baby boys is 365 × 0.2313 = 84.4 days.

For hospital 2:
- The expected number of baby boys born per day is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys is √(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 1.94.
- The probability of having more than 60% of the babies born as boys is approximately 0.2313 (same as for hospital 1).
- Assuming 365 days in a year, the expected number of days with more than 60% baby boys is 365 × 0.2313 = 84.4 days.

Since the expected number of days with more than 60% baby boys is the same for both hospitals (84.4 days), they are about the same (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 3}
