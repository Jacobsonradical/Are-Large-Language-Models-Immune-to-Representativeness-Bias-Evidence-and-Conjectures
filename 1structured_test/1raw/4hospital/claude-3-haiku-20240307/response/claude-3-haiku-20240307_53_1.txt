To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born per day in each hospital.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys is around 50%, but it can vary from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born per day in each hospital is as follows:

Hospital 1:
- With 45 babies born per day, the expected number of baby boys is 22.5 (45 × 0.5).
- To have more than 60% of baby boys, the minimum number of baby boys would be 27 (45 × 0.6).
- The probability of having 27 or more baby boys out of 45 total babies follows the binomial distribution.
- Using the binomial probability formula, the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys in Hospital 1 is approximately 0.25 or 25%.

Hospital 2:
- With 15 babies born per day, the expected number of baby boys is 7.5 (15 × 0.5).
- To have more than 60% of baby boys, the minimum number of baby boys would be 9 (15 × 0.6).
- The probability of having 9 or more baby boys out of 15 total babies follows the binomial distribution.
- Using the binomial probability formula, the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys in Hospital 2 is approximately 0.21 or 21%.

Comparison:
- Hospital 1 has a higher probability (25%) of recording more than 60% of baby boys per day compared to Hospital 2 (21%).

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
