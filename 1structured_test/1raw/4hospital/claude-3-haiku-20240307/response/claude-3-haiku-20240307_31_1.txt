To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the percentage of baby boys born.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.
- Each hospital recorded the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

To determine which hospital recorded more such days, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% baby boys in each hospital.

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a hospital can be calculated using the binomial distribution. The probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a sample of n babies is given by:

P(X > 0.6n) = 1 - P(X <= 0.6n)

Where X is the number of baby boys in the sample.

For hospital 1, with 45 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is:
P(X > 0.6 × 45) = 1 - P(X <= 27) = 0.2266

For hospital 2, with 15 babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is:
P(X > 0.6 × 15) = 1 - P(X <= 9) = 0.2266

Since the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is the same for both hospitals, they are likely to record about the same number of such days (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 3}
