To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born per day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born per day.
- The percentage of baby boys is around 50%, but it varies from day to day.

For a given day, the probability of having more than 60% boys can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For Hospital 1:
- With 45 babies, the expected number of boys is 22.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% boys (> 27 boys) is approximately 0.153 or 15.3%.

For Hospital 2:
- With 15 babies, the expected number of boys is 7.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% boys (> 9 boys) is approximately 0.177 or 17.7%.

Since the probability of having more than 60% boys is higher for Hospital 2, it is more likely that Hospital 2 recorded more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
