To solve this problem, we need to consider the average number of babies born per day in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- On average, 50% of all babies are boys.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys follows a binomial distribution, where the probability of success (having a boy) is 0.5, and the number of trials is the number of babies born per day.

For hospital 1, the average number of babies born per day is 45. The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 27 boys out of 45 babies) is higher than the probability for hospital 2, where the average number of babies born per day is 15. The probability of having more than 9 boys out of 15 babies is lower than the probability for hospital 1.

Therefore, I think hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% of baby boys.
