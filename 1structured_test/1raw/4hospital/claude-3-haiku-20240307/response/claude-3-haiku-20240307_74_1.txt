To solve this problem, we need to consider the expected number of baby boys born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- Around 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

Let's calculate the expected number of baby boys born in each hospital per day:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies × 50% = 22.5 baby boys
- Hospital 2: 15 babies × 50% = 7.5 baby boys

Now, let's calculate the probability of having more than 60% baby boys on a given day for each hospital.

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys can be calculated using the binomial distribution. For hospital 1, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is:
P(more than 27 baby boys out of 45) = 1 - P(27 or fewer baby boys out of 45)

For hospital 2, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys is:
P(more than 9 baby boys out of 15) = 1 - P(9 or fewer baby boys out of 15)

Since the exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, the hospital with a larger number of babies born per day (hospital 1) is more likely to have more days with more than 60% baby boys.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
