To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of babies born per day in each hospital and the expected number of boys born per day. Then, we can determine the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day and compare the number of such days between the two hospitals.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

Step 1: Calculate the expected number of boys born per day in each hospital.
Expected number of boys born per day in Hospital 1 = 45 × 0.5 = 22.5 boys
Expected number of boys born per day in Hospital 2 = 15 × 0.5 = 7.5 boys

Step 2: Calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day in each hospital.
Probability of having more than 60% boys in Hospital 1 = P(X > 0.6 × 45) = P(X > 27)
Probability of having more than 60% boys in Hospital 2 = P(X > 0.6 × 15) = P(X > 9)

The exact probability calculations depend on the underlying probability distribution of the number of boys born per day, which is not specified in the problem. However, we can make a reasonable assumption that the number of boys born per day follows a binomial distribution with parameters n (the number of babies born per day) and p = 0.5 (the probability of a baby being a boy).

Given the daily birth rates and the 50% probability of a baby being a boy, we can conclude that the probability of having more than 60% boys on a given day is higher in Hospital 2 than in Hospital 1. This is because the number of babies born per day is smaller in Hospital 2, which makes the probability of deviating from the expected 50% boys more likely.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 2}
