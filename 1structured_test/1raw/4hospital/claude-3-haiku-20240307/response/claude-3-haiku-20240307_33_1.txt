To solve this problem, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of baby boys born each day and the difference in the number of babies born in each hospital.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, sometimes higher than 50% and sometimes lower.

The hospital with more babies born each day (Hospital 1) is likely to have a greater number of days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%. This is because a larger sample size (45 babies) provides more opportunities for the percentage to deviate from the expected 50%.

In contrast, Hospital 2 has a smaller sample size (15 babies), and the percentage of baby boys is more likely to be closer to 50% on any given day.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Hospital 1 would record more days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.

Answer:
{hospital: 1}
