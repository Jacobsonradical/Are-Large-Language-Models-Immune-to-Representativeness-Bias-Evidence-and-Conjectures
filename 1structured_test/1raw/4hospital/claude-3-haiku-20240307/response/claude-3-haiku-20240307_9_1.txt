To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of a baby being a boy or a girl.

Given:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- On average, 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.
- Each hospital recorded the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys.

To determine which hospital recorded more such days, we can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of having more than 60% boys in a given day.

The probability of a baby being a boy is 0.5 (50%). The probability of having more than 60% boys in a day can be calculated as:

P(more than 60% boys) = 1 - P(less than or equal to 60% boys)

For hospital 1, with 45 babies born per day:
P(more than 60% boys) = 1 - P(less than or equal to 27 boys out of 45)

For hospital 2, with 15 babies born per day:
P(more than 60% boys) = 1 - P(less than or equal to 9 boys out of 15)

Since hospital 1 has a larger number of births per day, the probability of having more than 60% boys is higher compared to hospital 2. Therefore, hospital 1 is likely to record more days with more than 60% boys.

Based on the information provided, the answer is:

{hospital: 1}
