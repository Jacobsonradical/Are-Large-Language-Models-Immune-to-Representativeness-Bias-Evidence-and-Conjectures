To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of binomial distribution and the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born on a given day.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys is about 50%, but it varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born on a given day can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula.

For Hospital 1:
- The total number of babies born per day is 45.
- The expected number of baby boys is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 27 boys) can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula.

For Hospital 2:
- The total number of babies born per day is 15.
- The expected number of baby boys is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 9 boys) can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula.

Since the number of babies born per day is different for the two hospitals, the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys will also be different. Therefore, the hospital that recorded more days with more than 60% of baby boys is likely to be different.

Based on the information provided, my answer is:

{hospital: 1}
