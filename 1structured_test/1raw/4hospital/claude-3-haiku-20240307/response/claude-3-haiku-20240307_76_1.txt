To solve this problem, we need to consider the expected number of boys born in each hospital and the probability of observing more than 60% boys on a given day.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but the overall percentage of baby boys is about 50%.

Expected number of boys born per day:
- Hospital 1: 45 × 0.5 = 22.5 boys
- Hospital 2: 15 × 0.5 = 7.5 boys

The probability of observing more than 60% boys on a given day is the same for both hospitals, as the underlying percentage of baby boys is the same.

To determine which hospital recorded more days with more than 60% boys, we need to consider the number of days required to observe a statistically significant difference.

Given that the expected number of boys is different for the two hospitals, Hospital 1 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% boys, as the larger sample size (45 babies per day) allows for more fluctuations around the 50% benchmark.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
