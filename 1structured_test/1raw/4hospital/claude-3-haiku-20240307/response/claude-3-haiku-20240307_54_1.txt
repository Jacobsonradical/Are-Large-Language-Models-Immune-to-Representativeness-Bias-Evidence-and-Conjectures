To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys being born in each hospital.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

Assuming the number of baby boys follows a binomial distribution, we can calculate the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys in each hospital.

For hospital 1:
- Total number of babies per day: 45
- Probability of a baby being a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 27 boys out of 45 babies) = 0.2266

For hospital 2:
- Total number of babies per day: 15
- Probability of a baby being a boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 9 boys out of 15 babies) = 0.2778

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys is slightly higher for hospital 2 (27.78%) compared to hospital 1 (22.66%). Therefore, hospital 2 is more likely to record more days with more than 60% of baby boys.

So, the answer in the requested format is:

{hospital: 2}
