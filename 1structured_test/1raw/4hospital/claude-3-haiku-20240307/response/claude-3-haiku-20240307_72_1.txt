To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the expected percentage of baby boys.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- The percentage of baby boys is around 50%, but it varies from day to day.

The hospital that records more days with more than 60% baby boys is the one that has a higher probability of reaching that threshold.

The probability of having more than 60% baby boys in a single day can be calculated using the binomial distribution. For a given number of births, the probability of having more than 60% baby boys can be calculated.

Given the difference in the number of births per day between the two hospitals, hospital 1 has a higher probability of recording more days with more than 60% baby boys.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
