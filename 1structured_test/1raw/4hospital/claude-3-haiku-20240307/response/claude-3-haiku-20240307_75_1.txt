To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% boys.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- The exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, but on average, it is around 50%.

The probability of having more than 60% boys in a group of babies can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For hospital 1, with 45 babies born each day, the probability of having more than 60% boys (more than 27 boys) is higher than for hospital 2, with 15 babies born each day.

This is because the binomial distribution has a larger standard deviation for a larger number of trials (babies born), making it more likely to observe extreme values (more than 60% boys) in hospital 1 compared to hospital 2.

Therefore, it is more likely that hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% boys.

Answer:
{hospital: 1}
