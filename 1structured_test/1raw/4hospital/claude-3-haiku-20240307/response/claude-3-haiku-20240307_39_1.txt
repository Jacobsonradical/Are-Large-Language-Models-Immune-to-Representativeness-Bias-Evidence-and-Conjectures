To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of getting more than 60% boys for each hospital.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of getting more than 60% boys in a day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For Hospital 1:
- Number of babies born per day = 45
- Probability of a baby being a boy = 0.5
- Probability of more than 60% boys = 1 - P(≤ 60% boys) = 1 - P(≤ 27 boys)

For Hospital 2:
- Number of babies born per day = 15
- Probability of a baby being a boy = 0.5
- Probability of more than 60% boys = 1 - P(≤ 60% boys) = 1 - P(≤ 9 boys)

Since Hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born per day, the probability of getting more than 60% boys is higher for Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
