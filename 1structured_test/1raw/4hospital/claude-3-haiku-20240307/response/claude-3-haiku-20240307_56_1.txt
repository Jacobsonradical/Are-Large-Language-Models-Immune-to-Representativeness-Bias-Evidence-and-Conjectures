To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in each hospital.

Given:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys born in a day can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

For Hospital 1:
- With 45 babies born each day, the expected number of baby boys is 22.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 27 baby boys) is approximately 0.1025 or 10.25%.

For Hospital 2:
- With 15 babies born each day, the expected number of baby boys is 7.5.
- The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys (more than 9 baby boys) is approximately 0.0556 or 5.56%.

Since the probability is higher for Hospital 1, it is more likely that Hospital 1 recorded more days with more than 60% of baby boys.

Therefore, the answer is:

{hospital: 1}
