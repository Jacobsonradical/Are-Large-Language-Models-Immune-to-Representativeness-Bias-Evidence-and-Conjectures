To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of days when more than 60% of the babies born are boys for each hospital.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys on a given day is the same for both hospitals, as the overall probability of having a baby boy is 50%.

The binomial distribution can be used to calculate the expected number of days when more than 60% of the babies born are boys.

For hospital 1:
- Number of babies born per day: 45
- Probability of having a baby boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys: 0.2266 (calculated using the binomial distribution)
- Expected number of days with more than 60% of baby boys in a year: 365 × 0.2266 = 82.6 days

For hospital 2:
- Number of babies born per day: 15
- Probability of having a baby boy: 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys: 0.2266 (same as for hospital 1)
- Expected number of days with more than 60% of baby boys in a year: 365 × 0.2266 = 82.6 days

Since the expected number of days with more than 60% of baby boys is the same for both hospitals, we can conclude that they are about the same (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 3}
