To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys.

Given information:
- Hospital 1: 45 babies born each day
- Hospital 2: 15 babies born each day
- Approximately 50% of all babies are boys

The probability of having more than 60% of baby boys follows a binomial distribution with parameters n (number of babies born) and p (probability of a baby being a boy).

For Hospital 1:
- Number of babies born per day (n) = 45
- Probability of a baby being a boy (p) = 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys = P(X > 0.6n) = P(X > 27)

For Hospital 2:
- Number of babies born per day (n) = 15
- Probability of a baby being a boy (p) = 0.5
- Probability of having more than 60% of baby boys = P(X > 0.6n) = P(X > 9)

Since Hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born per day, the probability of having more than 60% of baby boys is higher for Hospital 1 compared to Hospital 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{hospital: 1}
