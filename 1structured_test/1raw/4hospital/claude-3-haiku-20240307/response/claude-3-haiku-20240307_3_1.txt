To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of days when more than 60% of the babies born are boys for each hospital, and then compare the results.

Given information:
- Hospital 1 has about 45 babies born each day.
- Hospital 2 has about 15 babies born each day.
- About 50% of all babies are boys.

Assumptions:
- The percentage of baby boys varies randomly from day to day, following a binomial distribution.

Step 1: Calculate the expected number of days when more than 60% of the babies born are boys for each hospital.
For Hospital 1:
- The expected number of baby boys born per day is 45 × 0.5 = 22.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys born per day is sqrt(45 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 3.35.
- Using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, the probability of having more than 60% of the babies born as boys is approximately 1 - Φ((27 - 22.5) / 3.35) = 0.156, where Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.
- Assuming 365 days in a year, the expected number of days when more than 60% of the babies born are boys is 365 × 0.156 ≈ 57 days.

For Hospital 2:
- The expected number of baby boys born per day is 15 × 0.5 = 7.5.
- The standard deviation of the number of baby boys born per day is sqrt(15 × 0.5 × 0.5) = 1.94.
- Using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, the probability of having more than 60% of the babies born as boys is approximately 1 - Φ((9 - 7.5) / 1.94) = 0.185.
- Assuming 365 days in a year, the expected number of days when more than 60% of the babies born are boys is 365 × 0.185 ≈ 68 days.

Step 2: Compare the results and provide the answer.
Since Hospital 2 is expected to have more days when more than 60% of the babies born are boys (68 days) compared to Hospital 1 (57 days), the answer is:

{hospital: 2}
