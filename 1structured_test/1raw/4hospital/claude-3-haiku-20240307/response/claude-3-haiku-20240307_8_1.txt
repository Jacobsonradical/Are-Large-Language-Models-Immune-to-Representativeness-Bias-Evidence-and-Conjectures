To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of babies born in each hospital and the variability in the percentage of baby boys.

Given information:
- In hospital 1, about 45 babies are born each day.
- In hospital 2, about 15 babies are born each day.
- On average, 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day.

Since the exact percentage of baby boys varies from day to day, it is likely that both hospitals will have days where the percentage of baby boys is greater than 60%. However, the number of such days may differ between the two hospitals due to the difference in the number of babies born.

To determine which hospital recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys, we can consider the following:

- Hospital 1 has a larger number of babies born per day (45) compared to Hospital 2 (15).
- The larger the number of babies born, the more likely it is to have days where the percentage of baby boys exceeds 60%.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Hospital 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with more than 60% baby boys compared to Hospital 2.

So, the answer is:

{hospital: 1}
