To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability. However, without knowing the total number of families surveyed, we can't provide an accurate estimate.

Assuming there are an equal number of families with each possible order of six births (BBBBBB, GGGGGG, BGBGBG, etc.), there would be 2^6 = 64 possible orders, and since there are 45 families with the order G-B-G-B-B-G, we would expect:

45 \* (number of families with G-B-G-B-B-G order) / (number of possible orders)
= 45 \* 1 / 64 â‰ˆ 0.703

families with the B-G-B-B-B-B order. But since the number of families must be a whole number, we can estimate that there is likely 0 or 1 family with the B-G-B-B-B-B order.

Therefore, my estimate is:
{answer: 0 or 1}
