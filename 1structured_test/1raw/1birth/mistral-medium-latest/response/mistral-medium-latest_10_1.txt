To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probabilities. Under this assumption, the birth sequence G B G B B G and the birth sequence B G B B B B are equally likely.

Therefore, if there were 45 families with the birth sequence G B G B B G, we would expect approximately the same number of families with the birth sequence B G B B B B.

So the estimated number of families with the birth sequence B G B B B B is also 45.

Answer:
{answer: 45}
