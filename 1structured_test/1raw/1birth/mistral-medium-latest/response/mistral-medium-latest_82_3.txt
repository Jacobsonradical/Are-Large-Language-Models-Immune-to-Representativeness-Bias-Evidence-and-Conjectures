To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which are equally likely (1/2 for each gender).

Under this assumption, the probability of having a specific birth order of six children is:

P(BBBBBB) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed.

First, let's calculate the probability of having the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G:

P(GBGBBG) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Now, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing the number of families with the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G by the probability of having that birth order:

Total families surveyed = 45 / (1/64) = 2880

Using the same reasoning, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B:

Number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B = Total families surveyed \* P(BGBBBB)

= 2880 \* (1/64)

= 45

Therefore, our estimate is:

{answer: 45}
