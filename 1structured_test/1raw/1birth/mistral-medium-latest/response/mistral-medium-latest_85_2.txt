To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, as there is no information provided about the gender distribution in the births.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50% each), we can calculate the probability of a particular birth order. The probability of the birth order G B G B B G is:

P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with this birth order, the total number of families surveyed can be estimated as:

Total families = 45 / P(G B G B B G) ≈ 2,880.77

Now, we can use this estimate to find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. The probability of this birth order is:

P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

So, the estimated number of families with this birth order is:

Estimated families with B G B B B B = Total families \* P(B G B B B B) ≈ 2,880.77 \* 0.015625 ≈ 45

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

answer: 45
