To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 0.5 for each. However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate.

Under this assumption, the probability of a particular birth order (e.g., G B G B B G) is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, since there are six births and each one has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl.

Since there were 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of this particular birth order: 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2874.

Therefore, we would expect the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B to also be proportional to the probability of this birth order, which is also (0.5)^6 = 0.015625. So our estimate would be:

answer: 0.015625 \* 2874 ≈ 45 families

Again, this is only an estimate based on the assumption of equal probabilities for boys and girls. The actual number of families with this birth order could be different if there are other factors influencing the probability of having a boy or a girl.
