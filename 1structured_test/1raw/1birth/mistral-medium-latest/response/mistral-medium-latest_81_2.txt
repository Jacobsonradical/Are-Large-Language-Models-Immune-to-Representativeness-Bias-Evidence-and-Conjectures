To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is a 50-50 chance. However, it's worth noting that this assumption might not be accurate in real life.

With that said, let's proceed with the calculation:

1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is 0.5 each.
2. The number of ways to arrange six children with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is 1 (since the order is fixed).
3. Therefore, the probability of having a family with this exact order of births is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.
4. Given that there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can use this as a sample size to estimate the total number of families surveyed.
5. Assuming that the probability of having a family with the order B G B B B B is the same in the entire population, we can estimate the number of such families as follows:

Estimated number of families = Total number of families \* Probability

Since we don't know the total number of families surveyed, we can't calculate the exact number of families with the order B G B B B B. However, we can express our estimate in terms of the total number of families surveyed:

Estimated number of families = Total number of families \* (0.5)^6

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

answer: (Total number of families) \* (0.5)^6 or approximately 1.56% of the total number of families surveyed.
