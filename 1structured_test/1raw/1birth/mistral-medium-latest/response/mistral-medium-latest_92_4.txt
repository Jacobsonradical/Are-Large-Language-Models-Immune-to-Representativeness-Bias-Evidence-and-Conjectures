To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be roughly equal (around 0.5 for each). However, without more information, it's impossible to provide an accurate estimate.

Assuming equal probabilities, the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is:

P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Similarly, the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

If we assume that these probabilities are equal and that the sample of 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G is representative, then we might estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be roughly equal as well. However, this is only a rough estimate and the actual number could be different due to random chance or other factors.

Therefore, my estimate based on these assumptions is:

answer: 45 families with the birth order B G B B B B
