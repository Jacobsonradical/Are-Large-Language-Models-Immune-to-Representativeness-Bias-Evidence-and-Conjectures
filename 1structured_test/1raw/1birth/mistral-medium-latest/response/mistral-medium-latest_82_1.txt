To answer this question, I'll assume that the birth of a boy or girl is a random event with equal probability (0.5) for each gender. This is a simplifying assumption, as it doesn't account for possible biological factors that might influence the distribution of birth genders in a family. With that assumption in mind:

1. There are 7! (7 factorial) or 5,040 possible birth orders for 6 children.
2. Since there are 2 genders, there are 2^6 = 64 possible combinations of boys and girls in a family of 6 children.
3. To find the number of arrangements with a specific gender order (e.g., G B G B B G), we can use the multinomial coefficient formula: (6!)/[(2!)(1!)(1!)(1!)(1!)] = 90.
4. Therefore, there are 90 possible arrangements for the birth order G B G B B G and 90 possible arrangements for the birth order B G B B B B.
5. In the survey, we know that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G.
6. Assuming that the distribution of birth orders is uniform and that the survey sample is representative of the entire population, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by multiplying the ratio of B G B B B B arrangements to G B G B B G arrangements (which is 1:1) by the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G (which is 45):

Estimate = (Number of B G B B B B arrangements / Number of G B G B B G arrangements) × Number of families with G B G B B G birth order
Estimate = (90 / 90) × 45
Estimate = 45

Therefore, my estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

answer: 45
