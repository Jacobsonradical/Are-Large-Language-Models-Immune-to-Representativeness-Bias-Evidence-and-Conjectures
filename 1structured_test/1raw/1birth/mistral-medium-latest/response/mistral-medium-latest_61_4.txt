To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability. Under this assumption, the order of births in families with six children follows a multinomial distribution.

Since there were 45 families with the exact order G-B-G-B-B-G, we can use this information to estimate the probability of this particular birth order. The probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) in each birth is 0.5, so the probability of the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G is:

P(G-B-G-B-B-G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Given that there are 45 families with this birth order, the total number of families surveyed can be estimated by dividing the number of families with this birth order by its probability:

Total number of families ≈ 45 / P(G-B-G-B-B-G) ≈ 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2875.29

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number, which is 2875.

Now, we can use this estimate to find the estimated number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B. The probability of this birth order is:

P(B-G-B-B-B-B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Therefore, the estimated number of families with this birth order is:

Estimated number of families = Total number of families × P(B-G-B-B-B-B)
= 2875 × 0.015625
≈ 45

Thus, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births B-G-B-B-B-B is approximately 45.

answer: 45
