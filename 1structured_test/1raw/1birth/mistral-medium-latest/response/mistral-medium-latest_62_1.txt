To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (50% chance for each gender). This is known as the binomial probability model. 

Under this assumption, the probability of a particular birth order, such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B, is the same for all orders with the same number of boys and girls.

Since there are 6 children in each family and we want to find the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B, we can use the same probability as before, which is (1/2)^6 = 1/64 for each family.

If there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and all orders are equally likely, then we would expect to find about 45 / 6 = 7.5 families with the order B G B B B B. However, since we cannot have half a family, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 8 families.

Therefore, our estimate is:

{answer: 8}
