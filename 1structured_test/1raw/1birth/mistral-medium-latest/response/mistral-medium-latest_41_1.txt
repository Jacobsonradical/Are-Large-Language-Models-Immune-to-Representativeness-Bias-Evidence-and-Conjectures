Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it's impossible to provide an accurate estimate. However, if we assume that the birth order of boys and girls is random and that each possible sequence is equally likely, then we can calculate the probability of a particular birth order and use that to make an estimate.

There are 720 possible ways to arrange 6 boys and girls (6! = 720). The number of ways to arrange the sequence G B G B B G is 720 / (3! \* 3!) = 40, since there are 3! ways to arrange the 3 boys and 3! ways to arrange the 3 girls. If 45 families had this birth order, then the probability of this birth order is 45/N, where N is the total number of families surveyed.

Similarly, the number of ways to arrange the sequence B G B B B B is 720 / (6! / 1!) = 120, since there is only 1 way to arrange 1 girl among 6 children. Therefore, if the birth order is random and each sequence is equally likely, then the expected number of families with this birth order is (120/720) \* N \* (number of families with G B G B B G) = 120/720 \* 45 = 8.125.

Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a family, we can round this to the nearest whole number to get an estimate of 8 or 9 families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Therefore, my estimate is:
{answer: 8 or 9 families}
