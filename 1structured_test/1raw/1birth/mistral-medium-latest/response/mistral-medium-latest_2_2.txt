Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it's impossible to provide a precise estimate. However, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided.

Since there are 45 families with the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, we can assume that the birth of boys and girls is roughly equally likely. If that's the case, then the probability of having a boy or a girl is 1/2 for each birth.

The birth order B-G-B-B-B-B has 5 boys and 1 girl, which is less likely than the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, which has 3 boys and 3 girls. Specifically, the probability of the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, while the probability of the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G is (1/2)^6 \* 6!/3!3! = 20/64 (since there are 20 possible arrangements of 3 boys and 3 girls).

Therefore, if there are 45 families with the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, we would expect there to be roughly (45 \* 20/64) / (1/64) = 45 \* 20 = 900 families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B.

However, this estimate assumes that the birth of boys and girls is truly random, which may not be the case. Therefore, the actual number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B could be higher or lower than our estimate.

answer: 900
