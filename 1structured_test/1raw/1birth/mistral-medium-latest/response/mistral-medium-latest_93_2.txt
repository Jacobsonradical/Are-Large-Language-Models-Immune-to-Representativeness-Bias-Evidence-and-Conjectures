To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of a child being born as a boy or a girl. Although the ratio can vary slightly, it's often assumed that the chances of having a boy or a girl are roughly equal (about 50% each).

Given that the order of births in the requested sequence is B G B B B B, there are 6 children with 5 boys (B) and 1 girl (G). Since the number of boys is higher than the number of girls in the given sequence (G B G B B G), it's likely that the sequence B G B B B B would occur less frequently.

However, without more information, it's difficult to provide an exact estimate. If we assume that the birth sequences are completely random, we could calculate the probability of the B G B B B B sequence occurring as follows:

1. The probability of having a boy first is 0.5.
2. The probability of having a girl second is 0.5.
3. The probability of having a boy third is 0.5.
4. The probability of having a boy fourth is 0.5.
5. The probability of having a boy fifth is 0.5.
6. The probability of having a boy sixth is 0.5.

The overall probability would be the product of these probabilities: 0.5^6 ≈ 0.015625 or about 1.56%.

Since there were 45 families with the G B G B B G sequence, and assuming that the birth sequences are equally likely, we could estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B sequence as follows:

(1.56% of the total number of families) × (number of families with the G B G B B G sequence)

However, since we don't know the total number of families surveyed, we can't provide a specific numerical estimate. Instead, we can express the estimate as a proportion of the number of families with the G B G B B G sequence:

answer: 0.015625 × 45 ≈ 0.703 or about 1 family (assuming similar likelihoods for both birth sequences)

Please note that this is a rough estimate based on the assumption of equal probabilities for boys and girls, and the actual number could be different depending on various factors.
