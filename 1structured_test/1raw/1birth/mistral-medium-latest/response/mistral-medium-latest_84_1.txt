To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we can use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G. However, without more information about the distribution of birth orders in the city, this estimate will have some degree of uncertainty.

Assuming that the birth orders are random and equally likely, we can use the probability of each birth order to estimate the number of families with a particular birth order. Since there are six children in each family and two possible genders (boy or girl), there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders.

The probability of the birth order G B G B B G is therefore 45/N, where N is the total number of families surveyed. Similarly, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also 1/64, since there is only one way to arrange six boys and girls in this order.

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can multiply the total number of families surveyed by the probability of this birth order:

Estimated number of families = N x (1/64)

Since we don't know the value of N, we can use the information about the 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G to estimate it. If we assume that this sample is representative of the entire population of families with six children, we can estimate N as follows:

N = (total number of possible birth orders) x (number of families with birth order G B G B B G) / (probability of birth order G B G B B G)

N = 64 x 45 / (45/N)

Solving for N, we get:

N^2 = 64 x 45

N = sqrt(64 x 45) = 56

This estimate of N is based on the assumption that the birth orders are random and equally likely, and that the sample of 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G is representative of the entire population. However, it's important to note that this estimate is subject to uncertainty and may not be accurate if these assumptions are not valid.

Using this estimate of N, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

Estimated number of families = N x (1/64)

Estimated number of families = 56 x (1/64)

Estimated number of families = 0.875

Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a family, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number. Therefore, our estimate is:

{answer: 1}

However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions and may not be accurate.
