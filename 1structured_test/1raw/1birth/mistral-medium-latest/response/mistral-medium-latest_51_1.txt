To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (0.5) for each gender. Under this assumption, the order of births follows a binomial distribution.

The probability of having a specific birth order can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:

P(X=k) = C(n, k) \* p^k \* q^(n-k)

where n is the number of trials (births), k is the number of successes (boys), p is the probability of success (0.5), q is the probability of failure (1-p), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

In this case, we want to find the probability of having 5 boys and 1 girl (B G B B B B), which is the reverse of the given birth order (G B G B B G). The probability of having 5 boys and 1 girl is the same as having 1 girl and 5 boys, so we can use the same formula.

Using the binomial probability formula, we get:

P(X=5) = C(6, 5) \* 0.5^5 \* 0.5^1
= 6 \* 0.03125 \* 0.5
= 0.09375

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, and the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is 0.09375, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

Number of families = Total number of families \* Probability of having the birth order B G B B B B
= 45 \* 0.09375
â‰ˆ 4.21

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number, which is 4.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

answer: 4
