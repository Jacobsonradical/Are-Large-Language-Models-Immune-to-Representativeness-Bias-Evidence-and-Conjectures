To answer this question, we would need more information about the total number of families surveyed or the probability of having a boy or a girl. However, since this information is not provided, we can only make an educated guess based on the given data.

Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely and that the births are independent events, the probability of having a boy or a girl is 1/2. Therefore, the probability of having the exact order of births B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Since there were 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of having that exact order of births, which is (1/2)^6 = 1/64. This gives us an estimate of 45 \* 64 = 2880 families surveyed.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: (1/64) \* 2880 = 45}
