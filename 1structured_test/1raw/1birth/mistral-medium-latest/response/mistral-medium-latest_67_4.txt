To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions as the information provided is not sufficient to calculate an exact answer. Here's how we can approach this:

1. We know that there are 45 families with the order G-B-G-B-B-G.
2. Since the families have six children, and the order G-B-G-B-B-G includes three boys and three girls, it appears that the gender ratio in these families is balanced.
3. Now, let's consider the order B-G-B-B-B-B, which has five boys and one girl.
4. If we assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50% each), and that the births are independent events, then the probability of the B-G-B-B-B-B sequence is:
   P(B-G-B-B-B-B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625
5. We also know that there are 45 families with the G-B-G-B-B-G sequence. The probability of this sequence is:
   P(G-B-G-B-B-G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625
6. Since both sequences have the same probability, we can assume that the number of families with the B-G-B-B-B-B sequence is also likely to be similar to the number of families with the G-B-G-B-B-G sequence.
7. However, due to the random nature of birth order and the smaller sample size, there might be some variation in the actual numbers.

Therefore, based on the information and assumptions provided, our estimate is:
{answer: ~45 families}
