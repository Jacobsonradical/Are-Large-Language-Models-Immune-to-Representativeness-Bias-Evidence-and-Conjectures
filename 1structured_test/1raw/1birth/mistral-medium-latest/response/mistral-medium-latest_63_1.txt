To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be roughly equal. Under this assumption, the order of births G B G B B G and B G B B B B are equally likely.

Therefore, if there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we would expect a similar number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Answer:
{answer: 45}
