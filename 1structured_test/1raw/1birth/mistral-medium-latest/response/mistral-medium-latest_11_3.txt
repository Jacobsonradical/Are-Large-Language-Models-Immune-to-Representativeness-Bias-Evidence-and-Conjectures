To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be equal (about 0.5 for each). However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in every population.

With this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is the same for each birth. Therefore, the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is the same as the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B, assuming that the births are independent events.

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, and the probability of having this birth order is the same as the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by multiplying the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G by the ratio of the number of possible birth orders with 6 children that match the pattern B G B B B B to the number of possible birth orders with 6 children that match the pattern G B G B B G.

There are 6!/(3! \* 3!) = 20 possible birth orders with 3 boys and 3 girls, and 6!/(5! \* 1!) = 6 possible birth orders with the pattern B G B B B B. Therefore, the ratio of the number of possible birth orders with the pattern B G B B B B to the number of possible birth orders with the pattern G B G B B G is 6/20 = 0.3.

Multiplying the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G by this ratio, we get an estimate of 45 \* 0.3 = {answer: 13.5} families with the birth order B G B B B B. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a family, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number, which is {answer: 14} families.
