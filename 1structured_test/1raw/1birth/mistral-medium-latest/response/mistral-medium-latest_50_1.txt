To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 0.5 for each birth. However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate and the actual number of families with the exact order B G B B B B could be different.

Under the assumption of equal probabilities, the probability of having a boy or a girl in each birth is 0.5. Therefore, the probability of having the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G, we can use this as a baseline to estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B.

First, let's find out the total number of possible orders of births for six children. There are 2^6 = 64 possible orders of births for six children, assuming equal probabilities for boys and girls.

Next, let's find out the ratio of families with the order G B G B B G to the total number of possible orders:

45 / 64 ≈ 0.703125

Assuming this ratio is the same for all orders of births, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

Number of families with order B G B B B B = (Total number of possible orders) × (Probability of order B G B B B B) × (Ratio of families with order G B G B B G)

Number of families with order B G B B B B = 64 × 0.015625 × 0.703125 ≈ 7.14

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number. Therefore, our estimate is:
