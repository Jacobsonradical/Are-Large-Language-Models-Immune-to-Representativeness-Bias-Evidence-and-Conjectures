To estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B, we first need to determine the relationship between the two birth order sequences and the total number of families surveyed.

Since both sequences (G B G B B G and B G B B B B) have six children, we can assume that the probability of a family having either of these birth orders is the same, provided there are no other factors influencing the birth order.

Given that 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate that an equal number of families would have the birth order B G B B B B.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order B G B B B B is also 45.

answer: 45
