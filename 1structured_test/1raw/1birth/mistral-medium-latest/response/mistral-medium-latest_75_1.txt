To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of a boy or a girl being born, which is typically assumed to be roughly equal (around 50% for each sex). However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate and the actual distribution may vary.

Given that there are six children in each family, the number of ways to arrange 6 births with the order BGBBBG is given by the binomial coefficient "6 choose 3" since there are 3 boys and 3 girls. This is equal to 20.

Since there are 45 families with the order BGBBBG, we can estimate the number of families with the order BGBBBB by assuming that the probability of this order is also equal to 20/("6 choose 6") = 20/720 ≈ 0.0278.

Therefore, if we assume that the sample of 45 families is representative of the entire population of families with six children, we can estimate the number of families with the order BGBBBB as follows:

(total number of families) \* (probability of BGBBBB)

We don't know the total number of families in the city, but we can use the number of families with the order BGBBBG to estimate it. Specifically, if 45 out of every 720 families have the order BGBBBG, then we can estimate the total number of families as follows:

(total number of families) = (number of families with BGBBBG) \* (720 / 20)
= 45 \* (720 / 20)
= 1512

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families with the order BGBBBB is:

(total number of families) \* (probability of BGBBBB)
= 1512 \* 0.0278
≈ 42

So, the answer is:
{answer: 42}
