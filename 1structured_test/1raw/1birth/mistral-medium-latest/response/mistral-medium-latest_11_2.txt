To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (0.5) for each birth. Then, we can use the information provided about families with the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G and apply it to families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B.

Since the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G contains 3 boys and 3 girls, and there are $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways to choose 3 positions out of 6 for the boys, we can calculate the probability of the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G as:

P(G-B-G-B-B-G) = $\frac{20}{2^6} = \frac{5}{32}$

By the same logic, the probability of the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B is:

P(B-G-B-B-B-B) = $\frac{6}{2^6} = \frac{3}{32}$

Now, if there are 45 families with the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B as follows:

Number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B = $\frac{P(B-G-B-B-B-B)}{P(G-B-G-B-B-G)} \times 45$

Number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B = $\frac{3/32}{5/32} \times 45 = 27$

Therefore, our estimate is:

answer: 27 families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B.
