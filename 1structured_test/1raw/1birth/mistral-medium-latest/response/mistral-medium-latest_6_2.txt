To solve this problem, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of a birth being a boy or a girl. Although the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal, it can vary slightly based on various factors. For simplicity, let's assume that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is 50% or 0.5.

The number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is given as 45. To find an estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the same assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl and calculate the probability of this specific birth order.

The probability of B G B B B B is:

P(B) \* P(G) \* P(B) \* P(B) \* P(B) \* P(B) = 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 = 0.015625

Now, let's find out the total number of families surveyed. Since we know that 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, and its probability is:

P(G) \* P(B) \* P(G) \* P(B) \* P(B) \* P(G) = 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 = 0.015625

We can set up an equation to find the total number of families (N):

45 = N \* 0.015625
N = 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2,872.73

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round it to 2,873 families. Now, we can use this total number of families and the probability of the birth order B G B B B B (0.015625) to estimate the number of families with this birth order:

Estimated number of families = Total number of families \* Probability of B G B B B B
= 2,873 \* 0.015625
≈ 45

So, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 45.

Keep in mind that this is an estimate, and the actual number might be different.

answer: 45
