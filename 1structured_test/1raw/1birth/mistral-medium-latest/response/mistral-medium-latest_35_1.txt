Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the probability of having boys or girls, I cannot provide an accurate estimate. However, if we assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (50%), then we can calculate the probability of a particular birth order and estimate the number of families with that birth order.

The probability of the birth order G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 0.015625, since each birth has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl.

Since there are 45 families with this birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as 45 / 0.015625 â‰ˆ 2875.

Similarly, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also (1/2)^6 = 0.015625.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with this birth order is (0.015625 / (1/2)^6) \* 45 = 45.

So the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 45.

Answer:
{answer: 45}
