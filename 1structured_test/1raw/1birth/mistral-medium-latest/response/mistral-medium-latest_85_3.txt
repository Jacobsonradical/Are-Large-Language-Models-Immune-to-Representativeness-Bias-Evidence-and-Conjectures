To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (0.5) for each birth. Under this assumption, the order of births is also random.

The number of families with the exact order G B G B B G is given as 45. Since there are 6 births in each family, there are 720 (6!) possible orders of birth for boys and girls. Therefore, the probability of the exact order G B G B B G is:

45/720 ≈ 0.0625

Assuming that the probability of the exact order B G B B B B is the same as that of G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B as follows:

Let X be the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B.

The probability of the exact order B G B B B B is:

X/N ≈ 0.0625

where N is the total number of families surveyed.

Since there were 45 families with the exact order G B G B B G, and we have assumed that the probability of each order is the same, we would expect there to be approximately the same number of families with the exact order B G B B B B. Therefore, our estimate for X is also 45.

However, to find the total number of families surveyed, N, we need to use the probabilities calculated above. Since there are 720 possible orders of birth and we have assumed that each order is equally likely, the probability of any particular order is 1/720. Therefore:

45/N ≈ 1/720

N ≈ 45 × 720

N ≈ 32,400

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families surveyed is approximately 32,400. Using this estimate, we can calculate the expected number of families with the exact order B G B B B B:

X = 0.0625 × 32,400

X ≈ 2,030

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B is approximately 2,030.

answer: {answer: 2,030}
