To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each. However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in real-life scenarios.

Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is the same for each birth, and the events are independent. Therefore, the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is the same as having the birth order B G B B B B, which is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Let N be the total number of families surveyed. Then, the expected number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is 0.015625 \* N.

Therefore, we have:

0.015625 \* N = 45

Solving for N, we get:

N = 45 / 0.015625 = 2874.17

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number, which is 2875.

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

Number of families with birth order B G B B B B = (0.5)^6 \* N = 0.015625 \* 2875 = 45

Therefore, our estimate is:
