To solve this problem, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each gender.

Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equal, and the order of births is independent for each child. Therefore, the probability of a particular birth order for six children is simply (1/2)^6, regardless of the specific order.

Since 45 families had the order G-B-G-B-B-G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Specifically, if 45 families had this order out of all the surveyed families, then the probability of this order is 45 / total number of families. Since the probability of this order is (1/2)^6, we can set up the following equation:

45 / total number of families = (1/2)^6

Solving for the total number of families, we get:

total number of families = 45 / (1/2)^6 = 45 \* 64 = 2880

Now, we can use this estimate to find the number of families with the order B-G-B-B-B-B. Since the probability of this order is also (1/2)^6, the expected number of families with this order is:

expected number of families = total number of families \* (1/2)^6 = 2880 \* (1/2)^6 = 45

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the order B-G-B-B-B-B is 45.

answer: {answer: 45}
