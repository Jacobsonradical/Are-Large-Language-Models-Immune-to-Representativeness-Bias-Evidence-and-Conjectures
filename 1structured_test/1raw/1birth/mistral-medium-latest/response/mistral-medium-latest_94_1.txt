To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is usually assumed to be roughly equal. However, without knowing the total number of families surveyed, we can't provide an accurate estimate.

Assuming that the total number of families surveyed is large enough for statistical patterns to emerge, we can use the fact that there were 45 families with the order G-B-G-B-B-G to estimate the number of families with the order B-G-B-B-B-B.

Since the two orders differ only by swapping the first two children, we can assume that the number of families with the order B-G-B-B-B-B should be roughly equal to the number of families with the order G-B-G-B-B-G, assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability.

Therefore, our estimate is:
