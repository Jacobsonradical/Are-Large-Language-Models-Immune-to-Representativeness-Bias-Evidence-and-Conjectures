To solve this problem, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of a child being born as either a boy or a girl. Since there's no information provided about any bias towards either gender, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of a child being born as a boy or a girl is equal, i.e., 0.5 for each.

Under this assumption, the probability of a particular birth order occurring is simply the product of the probabilities of each individual birth in that order.

1. For the birth order G B G B B G, the probability is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, as there are 6 births and the probability of each being a boy or a girl is 0.5.
2. Given that there are 45 families with this birth order, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed.
3. If X is the total number of families surveyed, then the expected number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is X \* (0.5)^6.
4. Setting this equal to the observed number of 45 families, we get X \* (0.5)^6 = 45, which gives us X ≈ 12,960 families surveyed.
5. Now, for the birth order B G B B B B, the probability is also (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, as there are 6 births and the probability of each being a boy or a girl is 0.5.
6. Using the estimated total number of families surveyed (X ≈ 12,960), the expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is X \* (0.5)^6 = 12,960 \* 0.015625 ≈ 203 families.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

answer: 203 families
