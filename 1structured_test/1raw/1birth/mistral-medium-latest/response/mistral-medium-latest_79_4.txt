To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, as there is no information provided about the ratio of boys to girls born in the city.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., 0.5 for each), we can calculate the probability of having a particular birth order. The probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is:

P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with this birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of having this birth order:

Number of families surveyed = 45 / P(G B G B B G)
Number of families surveyed = 45 / 0.015625
Number of families surveyed ≈ 2876.76

Now that we have an estimate of the total number of families surveyed, we can calculate the expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. The probability of having this birth order is:

P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

The expected number of families with this birth order can be found by multiplying the total number of families surveyed by the probability of having this birth order:

Expected number of families with B G B B B B = Number of families surveyed \* P(B G B B B B)
Expected number of families with B G B B B B ≈ 2876.76 \* 0.015625
Expected number of families with B G B B B B ≈ 45

So, based on our assumption of equal probabilities for boys and girls, we estimate that there are approximately 45 families with the birth order B G B B B B.

answer: {answer: 45}
