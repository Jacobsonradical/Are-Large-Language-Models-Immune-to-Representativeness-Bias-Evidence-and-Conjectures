To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions due to the limited information provided. I will assume that the birth of boys and girls in the population is approximately random and that there are no other factors influencing the order of births.

Given this assumption, the probability of a boy being born is approximately 0.5, and the same applies to a girl. The probability of a specific sequence of six births can be calculated by raising the probability of each individual birth to the power of the number of occurrences in the sequence.

For the sequence G B G B B G, the probability would be (1/2)^6 = 0.015625.

Since there are 45 families with this sequence, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing the number of families with the G B G B B G sequence by the probability of this sequence occurring:

Total families surveyed = 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2872.37

Now, we can use this estimate to predict the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. The probability of this sequence is also (1/2)^6 = 0.015625.

Estimated number of families with B G B B B B sequence = Total families surveyed * 0.015625 ≈ 2872.37 * 0.015625 ≈ 45

Therefore, based on my assumptions, I would estimate that there are approximately 45 families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.
