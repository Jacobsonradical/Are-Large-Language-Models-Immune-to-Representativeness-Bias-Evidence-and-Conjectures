To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the provided information and assume that the distribution of boys and girls is random and equally likely.

First, let's find the probability of having the exact order G B G B B G. The probability of having a boy or a girl is always 1/2, so the probability of having the exact order G B G B B G is:

P(G B G B B G) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since there are 45 families with this exact order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (N) by using the formula:

Number of families with a specific order = Total number of families * Probability of that order

45 = N * (1/64)

N = 45 * 64
N â‰ˆ 2880

Now that we have an estimate of the total number of families surveyed, we can use the same probability formula to estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Number of families with the exact order B G B B B B = Total number of families * Probability of that order

= 2880 * (1/64)

= 45

So, our estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:

answer: 45
