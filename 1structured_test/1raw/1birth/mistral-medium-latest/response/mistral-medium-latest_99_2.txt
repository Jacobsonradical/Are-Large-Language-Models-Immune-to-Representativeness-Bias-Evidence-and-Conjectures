To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each. However, without more information about the birth rates in this specific city, we cannot make a precise estimate.

Nevertheless, if we assume that the births of boys and girls are independent events and that the probability of having a boy or a girl is always 0.5, then the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Therefore, if there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we would expect the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to be:

(number of families with G B G B B G) \* (probability of B G B B B B)
= 45 \* 0.015625
= 0.703125

Since it is not possible to have a fraction of a family, we can round this number to the nearest whole number, which is 1.

Therefore, our estimate is:
