To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be roughly equal. However, without more information about the specific city or any trends in family sizes and birth orders, it's impossible to provide a precise estimate.

Assuming equal probability for boys and girls, we can consider the two birth orders as sequences of coin flips, where heads (H) represents a boy and tails (T) a girl. The given sequence G B G B B G can be represented as T H T H H T, while the sequence we want to estimate is B G B B B B or H T H H H H.

Since both sequences have six births, we can calculate the probability of each sequence occurring by raising (1/2) to the power of 6, as each birth has a 1/2 chance of being a boy or a girl. This gives us a probability of 1/64 for each specific birth order.

Given that there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of that sequence (1/64). This gives us an estimate of approximately 2880 families.

Now, we can apply the same probability (1/64) to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. By multiplying the estimated total number of families (2880) by the probability (1/64), we get:

(2880 \* 1/64) â‰ˆ 45

So, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is approximately 45.

Please note that this is a rough estimate based on the assumption of equal probabilities for boys and girls, and the actual number may vary depending on the specific population and factors influencing family sizes and birth orders in the city.
