To answer this question, we can use the concept of permutations and assume that the birth order of boys and girls are equally likely.

First, let's calculate the total number of possible birth order arrangements for 6 children. This can be calculated using the formula for permutations of r items from a set of n items, where n = 2 (boys and girls) and r = 6 (number of children).

The total number of permutations is given by:
nPr = n! / (n-r)!

In this case, n = 2 and r = 6, so:
2P6 = 2! / (2-6)! = 120 / 0! = 120 (since 0! = 1)

Now, we know that in 45 families the exact order of births was G B G B B G. Since there are 120 possible arrangements, the probability of this particular arrangement occurring is:

P(G B G B B G) = Number of families with G B G B B G / Total number of families surveyed
P(G B G B B G) = 45 / Total number of families surveyed

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the total number of families surveyed:

Total number of families surveyed = 45 / P(G B G B B G)

Since all birth orders are equally likely, the probability of the arrangement G B G B B G is the same as the probability of the arrangement B G B B B B. Therefore:

P(B G B B B B) = 1 / 120 (since there are 120 possible arrangements)

Now, we can use the total number of families surveyed calculated earlier to estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B:

Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = Total number of families surveyed * P(B G B B B B)
= (45 / P(G B G B B G)) * P(B G B B B B)
= (45 / (45/120)) * (1/120)
= 1

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:
