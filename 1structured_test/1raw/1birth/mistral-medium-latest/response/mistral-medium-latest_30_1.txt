To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (0.5) for each birth. This assumption may not be accurate in real life, but it's the only way to estimate the number of families with a different birth order based on the information provided.

Under this assumption, the probability of a particular birth order occurring is (0.5)^6 for a family with six children, as each birth has two possible outcomes (boy or girl) and there are six births.

Since there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing the number of families with this birth order by the probability of this birth order occurring:

Total families surveyed ≈ 45 / (0.5)^6 ≈ 2,816

Now, we can use this estimated total number of families to determine the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = (0.5)^6 \* Total families surveyed ≈ 0.015625 \* 2,816 ≈ 44.16

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number:

answer: 44 families
