Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

However, if we make the assumption that the birth order of boys and girls is random and equally likely, then we can calculate the probability of a particular birth order occurring. In this case, the probability of the birth order G B G B B G is the same as the probability of the birth order B G B B B B, since both involve six children and each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl.

Therefore, if 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, we might expect a similar number of families to have the birth order B G B B B B, simply by chance. However, this is only an estimate and the actual number could be higher or lower depending on various factors.

Answer:
{answer: Our estimate would be around 45 families, assuming that the birth order of boys and girls is random and equally likely.}
