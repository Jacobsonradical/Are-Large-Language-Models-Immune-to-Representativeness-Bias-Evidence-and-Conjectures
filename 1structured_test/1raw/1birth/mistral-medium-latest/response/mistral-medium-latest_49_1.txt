To solve this problem, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 0.5 for each birth. Without any other information, we can infer that the order of births is likely to be random and equally distributed among all possible sequences of six births.

There are $2^6 = 64$ possible sequences of six births when considering only two possibilities (boy or girl). Therefore, if 45 families had the sequence G-B-G-B-B-G, we can estimate that the number of families with the sequence B-G-B-B-B-B is also roughly proportional to the number of possible sequences.

Using this logic, we can calculate an estimate for the number of families with the sequence B-G-B-B-B-B:

(number of families with sequence G-B-G-B-B-G) \* (number of sequences B-G-B-B-B-B) / (number of sequences G-B-G-B-B-G)

In this case, there is only 1 sequence B-G-B-B-B-B and 1 sequence G-B-G-B-B-G, so the formula simplifies to:

(45 families) \* (1 / 1) = 45 families

However, since the number of families with the sequence G-B-G-B-B-G is likely not perfectly representative of the distribution of all possible sequences, this estimate should be taken as a rough approximation.

answer: {answer: 45 families}
