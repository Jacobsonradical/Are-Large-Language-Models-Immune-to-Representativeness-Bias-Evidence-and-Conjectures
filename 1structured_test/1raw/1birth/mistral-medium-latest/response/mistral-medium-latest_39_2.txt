To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations and make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl.

The number of ways to arrange 6 children with 3 boys and 3 girls is given by the permutation formula: P(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!. In this case, n = 6 and r = 3 for both boys and girls. So, there are P(6, 3) = 6! / (3! \* 3!) = 20 possible arrangements with 3 boys and 3 girls.

We know that 45 families have the arrangement G B G B B G. Since all 20 possible arrangements are assumed to be equally likely, we can estimate the number of families with the arrangement B G B B B B as follows:

(Number of families with G B G B B G / 1 arrangement) \* (1 desired arrangement / 20 total arrangements)

= (45 families / 1) \* (1 / 20)

= 45 / 20

= 2.25

However, since the number of families must be a whole number, we round up or down to the nearest integer. In this case, rounding down would result in zero families, which contradicts the assumption that all arrangements are possible. Therefore, we round up to:

answer: 3 families
