To answer this question, we would need more information about the total number of families surveyed and the distribution of birth orders. Without this information, it would be impossible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

However, assuming that the distribution of birth orders is random and that there are no other factors affecting the birth order, we can use the binomial probability formula to estimate the probability of a particular birth order.

The probability of having a boy or a girl is 0.5 for each birth. Therefore, the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this as a baseline to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Let X be the total number of families surveyed. Then we have:

45/X = P(G B G B B G)

X = 45 / P(G B G B B G)

X = 45 / (0.5)^6

X = 45 / 0.015625

X ≈ 2,879

Assuming that the number of families surveyed is approximately 2,879, and the birth order is randomly distributed, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

Number of families with B G B B B B = X \* P(B G B B B B)

Number of families with B G B B B B ≈ 2,879 \* 0.015625

Number of families with B G B B B B ≈ 45

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is approximately 45.
