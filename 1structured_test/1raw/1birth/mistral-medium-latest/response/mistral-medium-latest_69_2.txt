To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl. Since the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal, we can assume that each birth has a 50% chance of being a boy and a 50% chance of being a girl.

Under this assumption, the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, since there are six births and each one has two possible outcomes. Therefore, out of 45 families with this birth order, there were 45 / (1/64) = 2880 total births.

Similarly, the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64. Therefore, the number of families with this birth order can be estimated by multiplying the total number of births by the probability of this birth order and then dividing by the total number of births per family:

(2880 \* 1/64) / 6 â‰ˆ 7.47

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate up to the nearest whole number, which is 8.

Therefore, my estimate is:
{answer: 8}
