To answer this question, we would need more information about the total number of families surveyed or the probability of having a boy or a girl. Without this information, it is impossible to estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

However, if we assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5), and that the births are independent events, we can calculate the probability of having the exact order of births B G B B B B as:

P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Then, we can use the number of families with the order G B G B B G to estimate the total number of families surveyed. If 45 families out of the total had the order G B G B B G, then the total number of families surveyed is:

Total families = 45 / P(G B G B B G)

Since P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625, then:

Total families = 45 / 0.015625 = 2,872.73

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number to get an estimate of the total number of families surveyed:

Total families = 2,873

Finally, we can use this estimate to calculate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B:

Families with B G B B B B = Total families \* P(B G B B B B)

Families with B G B B B B = 2,873 \* 0.015625 = 44.94

Again, since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number to get an estimate:

Families with B G B B B B = 45

Therefore, based on the assumptions made, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

answer: 45
