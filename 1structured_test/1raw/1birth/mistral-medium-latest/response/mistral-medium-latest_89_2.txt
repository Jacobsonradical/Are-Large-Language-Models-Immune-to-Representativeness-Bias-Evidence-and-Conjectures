To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of a child being born as a boy or a girl. While the exact ratio can vary slightly, it's generally accepted that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (about 0.5 for each).

Since the exact order of births G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can estimate the probability of this particular birth order by dividing the number of families with this order by the total number of families surveyed. Let's call the total number of families surveyed "N".

(45/N) = Probability of the birth order G B G B B G

Assuming that the birth of boys and girls is independent and has a probability of 0.5 each, we can calculate the probability of the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

Probability of the birth order B G B B B B = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Now, we can use the probability of the birth order G B G B B G to estimate the total number of families surveyed:

N ≈ 45 / (0.5^6) = 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2879 families

Given this estimated total number of families, we can now estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

Number of families with the birth order B G B B B B = Probability of the birth order B G B B B B × Estimated total number of families

Number of families with the birth order B G B B B B = 0.015625 × 2879 ≈ 45

So, our estimate is that there are approximately 45 families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

answer: 45
