To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions since the data provided doesn't directly give us the information we need.

Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (0.5), the occurrence of a particular birth order is also a random event. Since there are six children in each family, there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders.

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order GBGBBG, we can estimate the probability of this particular birth order as:

P(GBGBBG) = 45 / (total number of families surveyed)

Since we don't know the total number of families surveyed, let's call it N. Then:

45/N = (1/2)^6 * k

where k is a constant that accounts for the fact that some birth orders may be more or less common than others. However, since we're assuming that all birth orders are equally likely, we can estimate k to be approximately 1.

Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB as:

Number of families with BGBBBB = N * (1/2)^6

Substituting the expression for P(GBGBBG) from above:

Number of families with BGBBBB = (45 / P(GBGBBG)) * (1/2)^6

= (45 / (45/N)) * (1/2)^6

= N * (1/2)^6

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births BGBBBB is:

answer: N/64

where N is the total number of families surveyed. Note that this is only an estimate based on the assumption of equal probabilities for boy and girl births, and the actual number may vary depending on the true distribution of birth orders in the population.
