To answer this question, I would need more information about the total number of families surveyed or the probability of having a boy or a girl. Without this information, it's impossible to provide an accurate estimate.

However, if we assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each), and that births are independent events, then we can calculate the theoretical probability of a particular birth order and use it to estimate the number of families with that birth order.

The probability of having a boy is 0.5, and the probability of having a girl is also 0.5. So the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is:

P(B) \* P(G) \* P(B) \* P(B) \* P(B) \* P(B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this as a baseline to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

If the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is 0.015625, and the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is assumed to be equal, then the ratio of families with these two birth orders should be approximately equal to the ratio of their probabilities.

Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as:

(Number of families with G B G B B G) \* (Probability of B G B B B B / Probability of G B G B B G)

= 45 \* (0.015625 / 0.015625)

= 45

So our estimate is that there are approximately 45 families with the birth order B G B B B B, assuming equal probabilities of having a boy or a girl and independence of births.

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on assumptions, and the actual number could be different.
