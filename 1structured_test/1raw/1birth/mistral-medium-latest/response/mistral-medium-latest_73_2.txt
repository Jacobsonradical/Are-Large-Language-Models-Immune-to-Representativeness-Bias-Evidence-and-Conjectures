To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions as the information given doesn't directly provide a way to calculate the estimate.

Assumption 1: The birth of boys and girls in a family is random and independent of previous births. This means that the probability of having a boy or a girl is always 0.5, regardless of the gender of previous siblings.

Assumption 2: The distribution of birth sequences is uniform across all possible sequences of six births. This means that each possible sequence (e.g., G B G B B G, B G B B B B, etc.) is equally likely.

Given these assumptions, we can calculate the probability of a specific birth sequence. Since there are two genders (boy or girl), there are 2^6 = 64 possible sequences for six births. Under our assumption of uniform distribution, the probability of any particular sequence is 1/64.

Now, we know that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G. If we want to find an estimate for the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we can use the following formula:

Estimated number of families = Total number of families * Probability of the specific sequence

However, we don't have the total number of families in the city. To work around this, we can use the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G as a proportion of the total number of families. Since the probability of this sequence is also 1/64, we can say that:

45 families / Total number of families = 1/64

Solving for the total number of families, we get:

Total number of families = 45 families * 64

Now, we can calculate the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B:

Estimated number of families = (45 families * 64) * (1/64)
                             = 45 families

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is 45 families.

{answer: 45}
