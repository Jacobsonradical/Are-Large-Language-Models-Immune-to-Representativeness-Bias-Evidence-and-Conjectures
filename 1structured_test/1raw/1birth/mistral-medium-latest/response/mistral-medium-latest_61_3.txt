To answer this question, we can use the concept of permutations. Since the order of births matters in this context, we can calculate the number of ways six births can result in the exact order B G B B B B by calculating the permutations of 6 items, where B and G are repeated 4 and 2 times, respectively.

The formula for permutations of n items with r1 items of one kind, r2 items of another kind, ..., rk items of another kind, where the sum of r1, r2, ..., rk equals n is:

P(n; r1, r2, ..., rk) = n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!)

In this case, we are looking for the permutations of 6 items with 4 Bs and 2 Gs:

P(6; 4, 2) = 6! / (4! * 2!) = 360 / (24 * 2) = 30

However, we cannot directly estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B from this permutation result, as the survey data does not provide information about the overall distribution of birth orders among the families. Instead, we can use the given data as a rough guide to estimate the probability of the desired birth order and then scale it up based on the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

First, let's calculate the probability of the birth order G B G B B G:

P(G B G B B G) = 6! / (3! * 3!) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 20/36

Next, we'll assume that all possible birth orders with equal numbers of boys and girls are equally likely, which might not be accurate but will serve as a starting point for our estimate. Since there are 30 possible birth orders with the exact order B G B B B B, we can estimate the probability of this birth order:

P(B G B B B B) ≈ P(G B G B B G) * (number of ways to arrange B G B B B B) / (number of ways to arrange G B G B B G)

P(B G B B B B) ≈ (20/36) * (30) / (20)

P(B G B B B B) ≈ 5/12

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B by multiplying the probability by the number of families with the order G B G B B G:

Number of families with B G B B B B ≈ 45 * (5/12)

answer: 20.83

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number:

answer: 21
