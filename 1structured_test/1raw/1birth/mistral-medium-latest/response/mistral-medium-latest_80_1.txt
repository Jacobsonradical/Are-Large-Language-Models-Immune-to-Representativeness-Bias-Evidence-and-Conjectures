To answer this question, we would need more information about the total number of families surveyed and the distribution of birth sequences. However, since that information is not provided, we can only make an assumption based on the given data.

Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (50% chance for each), we can estimate the probability of a particular birth sequence. The probability of the sequence G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, since there are six births and each one has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl.

Since there were 45 families with the birth sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Total families surveyed = (Number of families with G B G B B G sequence) / (Probability of G B G B B G sequence)

Total families surveyed = 45 / (1/64) = 2880

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the birth sequence B G B B B B using the same approach:

Number of families with B G B B B B sequence = (Total families surveyed) x (Probability of B G B B B B sequence)

Number of families with B G B B B B sequence = 2880 x (1/2)^6 = 45

Therefore, our estimate is:
{answer: 45 families}
