{answer: 45 * (5/6)^5}

Here's the reasoning:

1. In the given data, the order G-B-G-B-B-G has appeared in 45 families.
2. The probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is always 1/2 for each birth, assuming equal probabilities for boys and girls.
3. However, since the desired order B-G-B-B-B-B has one more boy than the order G-B-G-B-B-G, the probability of this specific order will be different.
4. The probability of the desired order is (1/2)^5 \* (5/6), where (1/2)^5 represents the probability of having 5 boys and 1 girl in 6 births, and (5/6) is the adjustment factor to account for the overrepresentation of boys in the desired order.
5. To estimate the number of families with the desired order, multiply the number of families from the original order (45) by the probability of the desired order: 45 \* (1/2)^5 \* (5/6).

Note: This estimate assumes that births are independent events, and the gender of one child does not affect the gender of other children.
