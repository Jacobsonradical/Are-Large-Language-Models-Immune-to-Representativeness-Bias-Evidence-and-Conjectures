To answer this question, I would need more information about the total number of families surveyed and the distribution of birth orders. However, since this information is not provided, I can only make an assumption based on the given data.

Assuming that the birth order of boys and girls is random and equally likely, we can calculate the probability of each birth order. The probability of having a boy or a girl is 1/2, so the probability of the birth order G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

If there were 45 families with this birth order, and the total number of families surveyed was N, then we can estimate N as follows:

(Number of families with G B G B B G) / (Probability of G B G B B G) = 45 / (1/64)

Therefore, N = 45 \* 64 = 2880 families

Using the same logic, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64. Therefore, the estimated number of families with this birth order is:

(Probability of B G B B B B) \* (Total number of families surveyed) = (1/64) \* 2880 = 45 families

Therefore, my estimate is:

{answer: 45 families}
