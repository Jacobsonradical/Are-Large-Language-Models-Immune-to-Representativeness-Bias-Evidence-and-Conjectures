To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions as the provided information only gives details about a specific birth order (G B G B B G). Here's how we can approach it:

1. Assume the births are random and independent events, with an equal probability of a boy (B) or girl (G) being born.
2. Under this assumption, the probability of a boy being born is 0.5, and the same applies for a girl.
3. Since the exact order of births for 6 children is asked for, we have to raise the probability of each birth to the power of 6.
4. Therefore, the estimated probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6.

Now, we can use the information provided about the families with the birth order G B G B B G to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

1. We know that 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.
2. This event also has a probability of (0.5)^6, as it consists of 6 independent births with an equal chance of a boy or girl being born.
3. So, the ratio of families with birth order G B G B B G to those with birth order B G B B B B should be approximately the same as the ratio of their probabilities.
4. Since both probabilities are equal to (0.5)^6, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also around 45.

However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate based on the assumption of random and independent births. The actual number could be different if there are other factors influencing the birth order in this population.
