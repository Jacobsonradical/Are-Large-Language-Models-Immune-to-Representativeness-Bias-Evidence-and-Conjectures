To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of a child being born as a boy or a girl. Although the ratio may vary slightly, it's generally accepted that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (around 0.5 for each).

Since the exact order of births in the requested pattern is B G B B B B, there are 4 boys and 2 girls in this sequence. The number of families with this sequence can be estimated using the same probability as the one used for the G B G B B G pattern.

Given that there were 45 families with the G B G B B G pattern, we can estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern as follows:

{answer: 45}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the probability of a boy or a girl being born is equal and that there is no inherent bias in the birth order. However, please note that this is only an estimate and the actual number may vary.
