To answer this question, we would need more information about the total number of families surveyed and the distribution of birth sequences. However, since that information is not provided, I can only make an estimate based on the assumption that all birth sequences are equally likely.

Assuming that each birth is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, there are 2^6 = 64 possible sequences of six births. Since there are 45 families with the sequence G-B-G-B-B-G, we can estimate the probability of that sequence as 45/N, where N is the total number of families surveyed.

Under the assumption of equal likelihood, the probability of the sequence B-G-B-B-B-B is also 1/64. Therefore, we would expect the number of families with that sequence to be N \* (1/64) = (1/64) / (45/N) \* 45 = (1/64) \* (N/45) \* 45 = N/64 \* (1/45) \* 45 = N/64.

Since we don't know the value of N, we can't provide a specific estimate for the number of families with the sequence B-G-B-B-B-B. However, we can express our estimate as a fraction of the total number of families surveyed:

answer: N/64
