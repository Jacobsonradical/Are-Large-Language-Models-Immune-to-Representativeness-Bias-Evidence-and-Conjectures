To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% each. However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in real-life scenarios.

Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy or a girl is independent and equal for each birth. Therefore, the probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B would be (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Since there were 45 families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Let N be the total number of families surveyed. Then, the expected number of families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G would be N \* (1/2)^6.

Since we know that there were 45 such families, we have:

45 = N \* (1/2)^6
N = 45 / (1/2)^6
N = 45 \* 64
N = 2880

Therefore, by the same logic, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B would be:

(1/2)^6 \* 2880 = 1/64 \* 2880 = 45

So, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is 45.
