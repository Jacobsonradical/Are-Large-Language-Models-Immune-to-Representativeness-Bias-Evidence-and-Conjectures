To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each. However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in real-life scenarios.

With this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is independent and equal to 0.5 for each birth. Therefore, the probability of having a specific birth order of six children is:

(0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

(number of families with G B G B B G) \* (number of families with B G B B B B / number of families with G B G B B G)

= 45 \* (0.015625 / 0.015625)

= 45

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

answer: 45
