To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% each. Under this assumption, the birth order patterns are equally likely.

Since there are 6! (720) possible birth order arrangements for 6 children, and we know that 45 families have the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B by multiplying 45 by the ratio of the number of ways to arrange B-G-B-B-B-B to the total number of possible arrangements:

(number of ways to arrange B-G-B-B-B-B) / (total number of possible arrangements) = 6! / (3! \* 3!) = 20

So, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B is:

(number of families with G-B-G-B-B-G) \* (number of ways to arrange B-G-B-B-B-B) / (number of ways to arrange G-B-G-B-B-G) = 45 \* 20 / 60 = 15

Therefore, the answer is:
{answer: 15}
