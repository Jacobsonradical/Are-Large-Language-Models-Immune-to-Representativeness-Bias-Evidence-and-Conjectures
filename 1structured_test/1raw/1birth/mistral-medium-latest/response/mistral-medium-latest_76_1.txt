Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate for the specific question.

However, if we assume that birth order is completely random and that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, then we can calculate the probability of a family having the birth order B G B B B B.

Since there are two possible outcomes (boy or girl) for each birth, the probability of a particular birth order occurring is:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64

This means that, on average, we would expect to see 1 family with the birth order B G B B B B for every 64 families surveyed.

However, since we don't know the total number of families surveyed, we cannot use this probability to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

answer: I cannot provide a specific estimate without more information.
