To answer this question, we would need more information about the total number of families surveyed and the distribution of birth orders. However, if we assume that the birth of boys and girls is equally likely and that births are independent events, then we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Under this assumption, the probability of a boy being born is 0.5, and the probability of a girl being born is also 0.5. Therefore, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this as a basis for estimating the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. If we assume that the distribution of birth orders is uniform, then we would expect the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to be proportional to the probability of this birth order.

Therefore, our estimate would be:

(number of families with birth order G B G B B G) x (probability of birth order B G B B B B) / (probability of birth order G B G B B G)

= 45 x (0.015625) / (0.0625)

= 1.05

Since it is not possible to have a fraction of a family, we would round this estimate to the nearest whole number. Therefore, our estimate is:
