To answer this question, we must first understand that the order of births in a family of six children is a permutation of 6 elements, where 3 are boys and 3 are girls. The number of such permutations is given by the multinomial coefficient:

C(6; 3, 3) = 6! / (3! \* 3!) = 20

Since there are 20 possible orders of birth for families with 3 boys and 3 girls, and we know that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by assuming that each order is equally likely.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

(Number of families with known order / Number of possible orders) \* Total number of possibilities

= (45 / 20) \* 1

= 2.25

However, since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number:

answer: 2 families
