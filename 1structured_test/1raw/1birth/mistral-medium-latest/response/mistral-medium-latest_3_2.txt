Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births BGBBBB. However, if we assume that the birth order patterns are equally likely among all families, we can make an educated guess.

Since there are 720 possible permutations of birth orders for six children (6 factorial), and 45 families have the order GBGBBG, we can estimate the proportion of families with each birth order as follows:

Proportion of families with GBGBBG = Number of families with GBGBBG / Total number of permutations
                                                    = 45 / 720
                                                    ≈ 0.0625

If we assume that this proportion is the same for all birth order patterns, we can estimate the number of families with the order BGBBBB as follows:

Estimated number of families with BGBBBB = Total number of families surveyed × Proportion of families with BGBBBB

Since we don't know the total number of families surveyed, we can't provide a numerical estimate. However, if we assume that the total number of families surveyed is F, our estimate would be:

Estimated number of families with BGBBBB = F × 0.0625

Therefore, without more information, our best estimate is that 6.25% of the total number of families surveyed have the exact order of births BGBBBB.

answer: {answer: 0.0625 \* total number of families surveyed}
