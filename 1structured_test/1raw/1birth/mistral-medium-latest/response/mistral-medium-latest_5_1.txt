To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions, as the information provided doesn't directly help us estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

Assumption 1: The birth order patterns are equally likely.
Assumption 2: There are no other birth order patterns with six children in the city.

Under these assumptions, there are 720 (120*6) possible birth order patterns for six children, where 120 is the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 6 children (using combinations formula: C(n,k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!]), and 6 is the number of ways to arrange the three boys and three girls.

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order pattern G B G B B G, and assuming each pattern is equally likely:

Estimate of families with the pattern B G B B B B = Total families with known pattern * (Number of patterns / Families with known pattern)

First, let's calculate the number of patterns:

Number of patterns = 720 (from our assumption)

Now, plug the values into the formula:

Estimate of families with the pattern B G B B B B = 45 families * (720 patterns / 45 families)
Estimate = 45 * 16
Estimate = 720

However, this number is based on the assumption that there are only two birth order patterns in the city (G B G B B G and B G B B B B). Since this is not realistic, it's important to note that this estimate is likely inaccurate and should be interpreted with caution. In a real-world scenario, additional data or information would be needed to provide a more accurate estimate.

{answer: 720}
