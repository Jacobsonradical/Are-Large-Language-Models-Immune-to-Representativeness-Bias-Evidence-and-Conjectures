To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% each. However, without more information about the birth rates in the city, we cannot make a precise estimate.

Assuming equal probabilities, the probability of having a boy or a girl is 0.5. Therefore, the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is:

0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this as a baseline to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

If the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is the same for all families, then we would expect the number of families with this birth order to be:

Number of families with B G B B B B = Total number of families \* Probability of B G B B B B

Assuming that the 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G represent a random sample of all families with six children in the city, we can estimate the total number of such families in the city by dividing the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G by the probability of this birth order:

Total number of families = Number of families with G B G B B G / Probability of G B G B B G

The probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is:

0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 = 0.015625

Therefore, the estimated total number of families with six children in the city is:

Total number of families = 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2875.56

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number, which is 2876.

Using this estimate, we can now calculate the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

Number of families with B G B B B B = 2876 \* 0.015625 ≈ 45

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is approximately 45.
