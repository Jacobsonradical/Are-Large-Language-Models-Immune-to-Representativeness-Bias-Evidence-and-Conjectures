To provide an estimate, we would need more information such as the total number of families surveyed or the probability of having a boy or a girl. However, since this information is not provided, we can only make an assumption based on the given data.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., 0.5), and that the births are independent events, then the probability of a particular birth order is:

P(GBGBBG) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Since there are 45 families with the birth order GBGBBG, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as:

Total families = 45 / P(GBGBBG) = 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2874

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order BGBBBB is:

Estimated number of families = Total families \* P(BGBBBB) = 2874 \* 0.5^6 ≈ 7.3

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number:

answer: 8
