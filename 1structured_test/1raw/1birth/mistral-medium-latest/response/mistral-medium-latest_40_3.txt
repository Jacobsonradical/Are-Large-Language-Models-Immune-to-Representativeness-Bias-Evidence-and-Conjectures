To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (50% chance for each). This is a simplification, but it allows us to make an estimate.

Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy or a girl is independent for each birth. So, the probability of a particular birth order is the product of the probabilities of each individual birth in that order.

For the birth order G B G B B G, the probability is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, since there are six births and each has a 1/2 chance of being a boy or a girl.

In 45 families out of the total surveyed, this particular birth order occurred. So, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of this birth order:

Total families ≈ 45 / (1/64)

Under the same assumptions, the birth order B G B B B B has the same probability as G B G B B G, so we can estimate the number of families with this birth order by multiplying the total number of families by the probability of this birth order:

Families with B G B B B B = Total families * (1/2)^6

Putting it all together, we get:

Families with B G B B B B ≈ (45 / (1/64)) * (1/2)^6

Therefore, the estimate is:

{answer: 45}

This is based on the simplifying assumption that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability for each birth. In reality, the actual probability may be slightly different due to various factors, so this estimate may not be exact.
