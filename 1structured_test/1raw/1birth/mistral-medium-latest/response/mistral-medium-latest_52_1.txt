Without more information about the total number of families surveyed and the distribution of birth orders, it's impossible to provide an accurate estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

However, if we make the assumption that the birth of a boy or girl is a random event with equal probability (50% chance), then we could use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of having the sequence B G B B B B.

The formula for binomial probability is:

P(X=k) = C(n,k) \* p^k \* (1-p)^(n-k)

where n is the number of trials (births), k is the number of successes (boys), p is the probability of success (0.5), and C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient "n choose k".

In our case, n=6, k=5, and p=0.5.

Using this formula, we can calculate the probability of having the sequence B G B B B B:

P(B G B B B B) = C(6,1) \* 0.5^1 \* 0.5^5 ≈ 0.09375

Since we know that there were 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this as a rough estimate of the total number of families surveyed. Assuming that the distribution of birth orders is random and follows a binomial distribution, we would expect approximately:

45 \* 0.09375 ≈ 4.2 families

However, since it is not possible to have a fraction of a family, we can round up to the nearest whole number to arrive at an estimate of:

answer: 5 families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

It's important to note that this is a rough estimate and the actual number could be higher or lower depending on various factors, such as the total number of families surveyed and any biases or non-randomness in the distribution of birth orders.
