To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be roughly equal in the absence of any other information. If we assume that each birth has a 50% chance of being a boy and a 50% chance of being a girl, then we can estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B using the same statistical principles that govern independent events with equal probabilities.

The probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) in each birth is 0.5, since we are assuming that these events are independent and have equal probabilities. Therefore, the probability of having the exact order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, since there are six independent events (births) and each has a probability of 0.5.

If 45 families had the exact order G B G B B G, then we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. We know that the probability of having the exact order G B G B B G is also (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, so the expected number of families with this order is:

Expected number of families with G B G B B G = Total number of families \* Probability of G B G B B G

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the total number of families:

Total number of families = Expected number of families with G B G B B G / Probability of G B G B B G

Total number of families = 45 / 0.015625

Total number of families ≈ 2875.94

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number, which is 2876.

Now that we have an estimate of the total number of families surveyed, we can use the same statistical principles to estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B. The probability of having the exact order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, so the expected number of families with this order is:

Expected number of families with B G B B B B = Total number of families \* Probability of B G B B B B

Expected number of families with B G B B B B = 2876 \* 0.015625

Expected number of families with B G B B B B ≈ 45

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is approximately 45.

answer: 45
