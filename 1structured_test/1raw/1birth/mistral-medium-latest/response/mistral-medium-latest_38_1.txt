To answer this question, we need to assume that the births of boys and girls are equally likely and independent events. Under this assumption, the probability of a boy or a girl being born is 0.5.

The exact order of births G B G B B G occurs in 45 families out of the total number of families surveyed. Let's denote the total number of families surveyed as N.

Therefore, the probability of the exact order of births G B G B B G is:

P(G B G B B G) = 45 / N

Assuming that the births of boys and girls are equally likely and independent, the probability of the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since the probability of a particular birth order is the same for all families, we can estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B by multiplying the total number of families surveyed (N) by the probability of the birth order B G B B B B:

Number of families with birth order B G B B B B = N \* P(B G B B B B)

We can solve for N using the probability of the birth order G B G B B G:

N = 45 / P(G B G B B G)

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

Number of families with birth order B G B B B B = (45 / P(G B G B B G)) \* P(B G B B B B)

Substituting the values of P(G B G B B G) and P(B G B B B B), we get:

Number of families with birth order B G B B B B = (45 / (6 \* (1/2)^6)) \* (1/64)

Simplifying, we get:

Number of families with birth order B G B B B B = 45 / 64

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is 45/64 or approximately 0.703125 \* 64 = 45.125. However, since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 45.

Therefore, the answer is:
{answer: 45}

Note: This is only an estimate based on the assumption of equally likely and independent births of boys and girls. The actual number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B may be different.
