To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of a child being born as a boy or a girl. In the absence of any additional information, we can assume that the probability of a child being born as a boy or a girl is equal, i.e., 0.5.

Under this assumption, the probability of a family having six children with the exact order of births G B G B B G is given by:

P(G B G B B G) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Similarly, the probability of a family having six children with the exact order of births B G B B B B is given by:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Since the probabilities of these two sequences are equal, we can estimate the number of families having six children with the exact order of births B G B B B B by multiplying the number of families with the G B G B B G sequence by the ratio of the two sequences.

Therefore, our estimate is:

Number of families with B G B B B B sequence = Number of families with G B G B B G sequence × (Number of ways to arrange B G B B B B / Number of ways to arrange G B G B B G)

The number of ways to arrange the B G B B B B sequence is 6!, which is equal to 720. The number of ways to arrange the G B G B B G sequence is 720/6 = 120, since there are 6 identical boys and 1 identical girl.

Therefore, the ratio of the two sequences is:

Ratio = (Number of ways to arrange B G B B B B / Number of ways to arrange G B G B B G) = 720 / 120 = 6

Thus, our estimate is:

Number of families with B G B B B B sequence = 45 × 6 = 270

Therefore, our answer is:
{answer: 270}
