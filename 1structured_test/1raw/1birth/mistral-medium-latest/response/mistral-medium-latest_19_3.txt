To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, since the information provided does not specify any differences in the likelihood of these events.

Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely (with a probability of 1/2 each), we can calculate the probability of a particular birth order. For the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, this probability would be (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Given that there are 45 families with this birth order out of the total number of families surveyed, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (N) by:

45 = (1/64) \* N

Solving for N, we get:

N = 45 \* 64 â‰ˆ 2880

Now, we can calculate the estimated number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B using the same probability:

Estimated number of families = (1/2)^6 \* N = (1/64) \* 2880 = 45

So, the estimated number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B is 45.
