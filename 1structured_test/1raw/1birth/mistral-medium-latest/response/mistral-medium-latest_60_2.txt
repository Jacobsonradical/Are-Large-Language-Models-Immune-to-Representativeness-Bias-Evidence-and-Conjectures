To answer this question, we would need more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders in the population. Without this information, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate. However, if we assume that the distribution of birth orders is random and that each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, we can make a rough estimate.

Under this assumption, the probability of a particular birth order occurring is (1/2)^6, or approximately 0.015625, since there are two possibilities (boy or girl) for each of the six births. Therefore, the expected number of families with a particular birth order in a sample of size N is N \* (1/2)^6.

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Specifically, we can divide 45 by the probability of this birth order occurring, which is also (1/2)^6. This gives us an estimated total of approximately 2816 families surveyed.

Using this estimate, we can then calculate the expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

Expected number of families = Total number of families \* Probability of birth order
= 2816 \* (1/2)^6
= 1.5625

However, since it is not possible to have a fraction of a family, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number. Therefore, our final estimate is:

answer: 2 families
