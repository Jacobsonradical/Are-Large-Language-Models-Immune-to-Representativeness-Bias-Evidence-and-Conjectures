To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each in the absence of any other information.

Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is independent and equal for each birth. Therefore, the probability of having the birth sequence G B G B B G is the same as the probability of having the birth sequence B G B B B B.

Since there were 45 families with the birth sequence G B G B B G, our estimate for the number of families with the birth sequence B G B B B B is also 45.

Therefore, the answer is:
{answer: 45}
