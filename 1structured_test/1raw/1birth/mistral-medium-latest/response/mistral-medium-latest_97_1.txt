To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probabilities. Under this assumption, the order of births in a family of six children follows a multinomial distribution.

Since there are 45 families with the exact order of births G-B-G-B-B-G, we can use this information to estimate the probability of this particular sequence of births. The probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) in each birth is 0.5, assuming equal probabilities for both sexes. Therefore, the probability of the sequence G-B-G-B-B-G is:

P(G-B-G-B-B-G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Under the assumption of equal probabilities, the probability of the sequence B-G-B-B-B-B is also 0.5^6 = 0.015625. However, since the order of births is not equally likely for all sequences, we need to adjust our estimate to account for the fact that the sequence B-G-B-B-B-B has one more boy than the sequence G-B-G-B-B-G.

The number of families with the exact order of births B-G-B-B-B-B can be estimated using the binomial distribution, which describes the probability of obtaining a certain number of "successes" (in this case, families with the sequence B-G-B-B-B-B) in a fixed number of independent trials (in this case, the total number of families surveyed).

Let X be the number of families with the exact order of births B-G-B-B-B-B, and let n be the total number of families surveyed. Then, X follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and p=0.015625 (the probability of the sequence B-G-B-B-B-B).

Since we don't know the value of n, we can't calculate the exact number of families with the sequence B-G-B-B-B-B. However, we can estimate it using the expected value of the binomial distribution, which is given by np.

Using the information that there are 45 families with the sequence G-B-G-B-B-G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Let Y be the number of families with the exact order of births G-B-G-B-B-G, and let q=1-p be the probability of the sequence G-B-G-B-B-G. Then, Y also follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and q=0.984375. The expected value of Y is given by nq.

We are given that Y=45, so we can estimate n as:

n = Y/q = 45 / 0.984375 ≈ 45.71

Since n must be an integer, we can round it up to the nearest integer, which is 46. Therefore, our estimate of the total number of families surveyed is 46.

Using this estimate, we can calculate the expected number of families with the sequence B-G-B-B-B-B as:

np = 46 \* 0.015625 ≈ 0.72

Since the expected value is not an integer, we can round it to the nearest integer, which is 1. Therefore, our estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births B-G-B-B-B-B is:
