To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 0.5 for each birth. However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate and may not reflect the true distribution of births in this city.

With that said, let's assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability, and the events are independent of each other. Then, the probability of having a specific birth order of six children is simply (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, or approximately 1.56%.

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of having that specific birth order:

Total families surveyed = 45 / (0.5)^6 ≈ 19688

Then, to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can multiply the total number of families surveyed by the probability of having that specific birth order:

Number of families with B G B B B B = 19688 \* (0.5)^6 ≈ 308

Therefore, our estimate is that there were approximately 308 families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

answer: 308
