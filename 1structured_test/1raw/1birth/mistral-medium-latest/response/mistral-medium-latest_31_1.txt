To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each gender. However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in all populations.

With that said, let's assume that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is 0.5 for each birth. Then, the probability of having the exact order of births G B G B B G is:

P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with this birth order out of the total number of families surveyed, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Number of families = 45 / P(G B G B B G) ≈ 2888.89

Now, let's calculate the probability of having the exact order of births B G B B B B:

P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Using the same assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, we can estimate the number of families with this birth order as:

Number of families = Total number of families \* P(B G B B B B)
≈ 2888.89 \* 0.015625
≈ 45

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is approximately {answer: 45}.
