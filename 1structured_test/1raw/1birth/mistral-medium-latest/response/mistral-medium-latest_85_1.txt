To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, as there is no information given about the gender ratio in the city.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50% each), we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of having a specific birth order.

The formula for binomial probability is:

P(X=k) = C(n,k) \* p^k \* q^(n-k)

where:
n = number of trials (in this case, the number of births)
k = number of successes (in this case, the number of boys)
p = probability of success (in this case, 0.5 for boys and 0.5 for girls)
q = probability of failure (in this case, 1 - p)
C(n,k) = number of combinations of n items taken k at a time

For the birth order B G B B B B, there are 6 births and 5 boys, so n=6 and k=5. The probability of having a boy is p=0.5, and the probability of having a girl is q=1-p=0.5.

Using the binomial probability formula, we can calculate the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

P(B G B B B B) = C(6,5) \* 0.5^5 \* 0.5^1
P(B G B B B B) = 6 \* 0.03125 \* 0.5
P(B G B B B B) = 0.09375

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, and the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is about 1/10th of the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G (0.09375 / 0.9375 â‰ˆ 0.1), we can estimate that there are about 45 \* 0.1 = 4.5 families with the birth order B G B B B B.

However, since we cannot have half a family, we would round this estimate to the nearest whole number.

answer: 5
