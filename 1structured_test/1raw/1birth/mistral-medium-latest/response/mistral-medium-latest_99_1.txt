To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% each. However, it's important to note that this assumption might not hold true in reality.

With this assumption, the probability of having a boy or a girl is the same for each birth. Therefore, the probability of a particular birth order is the same for all orders with the same number of boys and girls.

Since there are 6 children in each family, there are $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ possible orders with exactly 3 boys and 3 girls. The order G B G B B G is one of these 20 orders.

If there were 45 families with this particular order, and all orders are equally likely, then we would expect there to be approximately the same number of families with each of the other 19 orders. Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

answer: 45 / 20 \* 1 = 2.25

However, since it's not possible to have a fraction of a family, we can round up to the nearest whole number to get an estimate of 3 families with the order B G B B B B. Again, this is based on the assumption that all birth orders are equally likely, which might not be the case in reality.
