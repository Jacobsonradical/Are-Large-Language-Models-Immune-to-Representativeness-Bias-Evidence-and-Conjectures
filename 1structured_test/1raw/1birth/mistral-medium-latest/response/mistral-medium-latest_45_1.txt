To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions as the information provided does not directly relate to the requested estimate. Here's my reasoning:

Assumption 1: The birth of boys and girls is random and follows a binomial distribution with equal probabilities (p = 0.5) for each gender.
Assumption 2: The order of births in different families is independent and identically distributed (IID).

Under these assumptions, the probability of a particular birth order (e.g., G B G B B G) for six children is given by the multinomial probability mass function:

P(X1 = k1, X2 = k2) = (n! / (k1! \* k2!)) \* p^k1 \* (1-p)^k2

where n is the total number of trials (births), k1 and k2 are the number of successes (boys) and failures (girls), respectively, and p is the probability of success (birth of a boy).

The requested birth order is B G B B B B, which has 5 boys (successes) and 1 girl (failure). Using the formula above with p = 0.5, we get:

P(B G B B B B) = (6! / (5! \* 1!)) \* (0.5)^5 \* (0.5)^1 ≈ 0.0625

In the survey, 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G. Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B can be found by multiplying the probability of this birth order by the number of families with the G B G B B G birth order:

Estimated number of families = 45 \* 0.0625 ≈ 2.8125

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number:
