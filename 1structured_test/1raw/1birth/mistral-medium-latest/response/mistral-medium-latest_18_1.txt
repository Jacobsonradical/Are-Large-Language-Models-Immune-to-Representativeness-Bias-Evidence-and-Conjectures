To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (0.5) for each gender. Under this assumption, the order of births in families with six children follows a multinomial distribution.

The probability of having the exact order G B G B B G is given by:

P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 × 6! / (2! × 1! × 1! × 2! × 1!) = 0.01389

Where 6! is the number of ways to arrange six births, and the denominator is the number of ways to arrange the specific order of boys and girls (two groups of two boys, one group of one boy, and two groups of one girl).

If there were 45 families with the exact order G B G B B G, then the estimated number of families surveyed with the exact order B G B B B B is:

Number of families with B G B B B B = Total families surveyed × P(B G B B B B) / P(G B G B B G)

Since the probability of B G B B B B is also 0.01389 (assuming equal probabilities for boys and girls), the ratio of the probabilities is 1. Therefore:

Number of families with B G B B B B = 45 × 1 = 45

So, the estimated number of families surveyed with the exact order B G B B B B is 45.

answer: 45
