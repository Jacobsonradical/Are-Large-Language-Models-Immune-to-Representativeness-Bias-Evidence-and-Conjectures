To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% each. However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in real-life scenarios.

Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) in a birth is 0.5. Since births are independent events, the probability of a particular birth order can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual birth in that order.

For the birth order G B G B B G, the probability is:

P(G B G B B G) = 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 = 0.015625

Similarly, for the birth order B G B B B B, the probability is:

P(B G B B B B) = 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 = 0.015625

Since both birth orders have the same probability, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by assuming that it is equal to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.

answer: 45
