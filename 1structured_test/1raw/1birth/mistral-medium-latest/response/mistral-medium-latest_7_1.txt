To answer this question, I'll assume that births are independent events and that the probability of having a boy or a girl is the same (0.5 for each gender). 

Under these assumptions, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is always 0.5, regardless of the previous births. 

The order B G B B B B has 6 births, just like the order G B G B B G, and there are no restrictions on the gender of the firstborn. 

Therefore, if there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, my estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B would also be around 45.

{answer: 45}
