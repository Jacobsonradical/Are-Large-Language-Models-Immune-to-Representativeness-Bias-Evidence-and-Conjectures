To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% each. However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in real-life scenarios.

Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equal, so the probability of having a particular birth order of six children is:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since there are 45 families with the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of having this birth order:

Total number of families = 45 / (1/64) = 2880

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B by multiplying the total number of families by the probability of having this birth order:

Number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B = 2880 \* (1/2)^6 = 2880 / 64 = 45

However, since this is an estimate based on the assumption of equal probabilities of having a boy or a girl, the actual number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B may be different.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B is:

answer: 45
