To answer this question, we would need more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders in the population. Without this information, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate.

However, if we assume that the distribution of birth orders is random and that each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, then we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of a particular birth order.

The probability of a birth order with 6 children and exactly k boys is given by the binomial probability formula:

P(k boys) = C(6,k) \* (0.5)^k \* (0.5)^(6-k)

where C(6,k) is the number of combinations of 6 items taken k at a time.

Using this formula, we can calculate the probability of a birth order with exactly 5 boys and 1 girl:

P(5 boys and 1 girl) = C(6,5) \* (0.5)^5 \* (0.5)^1
= 6 \* (0.5)^6
= 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. If we assume that the distribution of birth orders is random, then the expected number of families with this birth order would be:

Expected number of families with G B G B B G = Total number of families surveyed \* P(G B G B B G)

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the total number of families surveyed:

Total number of families surveyed = Expected number of families with G B G B B G / P(G B G B B G)
= 45 / (0.015625)
= 2879.45

Since the number of families surveyed must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number, which is approximately 2880 families.

Using this estimate, we can then calculate the expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

Expected number of families with B G B B B B = Total number of families surveyed \* P(B G B B B B)
= 2880 \* (0.00390625)
= 11.27

Again, since the number of families surveyed must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number, which is approximately 11 families.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is approximately 11 families.

answer: 11
