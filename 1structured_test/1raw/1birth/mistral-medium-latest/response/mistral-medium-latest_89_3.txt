To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% each. However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate, and the actual number may vary depending on various factors.

With that said, let's proceed with our calculation:

The probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is 0.5 each.

Therefore, the probability of having the birth order "B G B B B B" is:

0.5 (probability of having a boy first) \*
0.5 (probability of having a girl second) \*
0.5 (probability of having a boy third) \*
0.5 (probability of having a boy fourth) \*
0.5 (probability of having a boy fifth) \*
0.5 (probability of having a boy sixth)

= 0.5^6
= 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the birth order "G B G B B G", we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Let x be the total number of families surveyed.
Then, the probability of having the birth order "G B G B B G" in x families is 45/x.

Assuming that the probability of having a particular birth order is the same for all families, we can write:

45/x = 0.015625

Solving for x, we get:

x = 45 / 0.015625
x = 2874.375

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round x to the nearest whole number to get an estimate of the total number of families surveyed. Therefore, our estimate is:

x = 2875 families

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order "B G B B B B" as follows:

Number of families with birth order "B G B B B B" = Total number of families surveyed \* Probability of having the birth order "B G B B B B"
= 2875 \* 0.015625
= 45

Therefore, our estimate is that there were approximately {answer: 45} families surveyed with the birth order "B G B B B B".
