To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 0.5 for each child born. However, without more information about the specific city's birth rates, we cannot make a definitive estimate.

Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability, we can calculate the probability of a particular birth order occurring. For the birth order G B G B B G, the probability is:

P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Since there are 45 families with this birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing the number of families with this birth order by the probability of this birth order occurring:

Estimated total number of families = 45 / P(G B G B B G) = 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2875.39

Now, we can calculate the probability of the birth order B G B B B B occurring:

P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Finally, we can estimate the number of families with this birth order by multiplying the estimated total number of families by the probability of this birth order occurring:

Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = Estimated total number of families \* P(B G B B B B)
= 2875.39 \* 0.015625 ≈ 45

Therefore, our estimate is:
{answer: 45}
