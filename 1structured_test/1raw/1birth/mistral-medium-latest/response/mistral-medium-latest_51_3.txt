Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it's impossible to provide an accurate estimate. However, if we assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely and independent of previous births, then the probability of a particular birth order is simply the product of the probabilities of each individual birth.

Under this assumption, the probability of the birth order "GBGBBG" is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, and the probability of the birth order "BGBBBB" is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64. Since these probabilities are equal, we might expect the number of families with each birth order to be roughly equal, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large.

Therefore, if there were 45 families with the birth order "GBGBBG", then our estimate for the number of families with the birth order "BGBBBB" would also be around 45. However, it's important to note that this is just a rough estimate based on limited information, and the actual number could be quite different.

answer: 45
