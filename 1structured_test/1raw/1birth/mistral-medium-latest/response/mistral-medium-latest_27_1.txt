To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can assume that the distribution of birth sequences is random. Since there are 7! (7 factorial) or 5,040 possible sequences for 6 births, and we know that 45 families have the order G B G B B G, we can calculate the probability of a particular birth order as:

probability = (number of families with a specific order) / (total possible orders)

probability = 45 / 5,040 ≈ 0.009

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by multiplying the total number of families surveyed (which we don't know directly) by the probability we just calculated:

estimate = (total families) × 0.009

Since we know that there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and the probability of each specific order should be the same under the assumption of random birth sequences, we can set up the following relationship:

45 = (total families) × 0.009

Solving for total families, we get:

total families ≈ 45 / 0.009 ≈ 5,000

Now, using this estimated total number of families, we can calculate the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B:

estimate = (total families) × 0.009
estimate = 5,000 × 0.009

So, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:
