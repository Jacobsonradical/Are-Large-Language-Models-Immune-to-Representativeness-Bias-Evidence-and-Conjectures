To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each. However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in real-life scenarios.

With that said, let's assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability. Then, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is 0.5 for each birth.

Since the exact order of births in question is B G B B B B, we can calculate the probability of this sequence occurring as follows:

P(B) \* P(G) \* P(B) \* P(B) \* P(B) \* P(B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Therefore, if there were 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

First, let's find out the total number of possible orders of births for six children. This can be calculated using the formula for permutations with repetitions:

n! / (r1! \* r2! \* ... \* rk!)

where n is the total number of births (in this case, 6), and r1, r2, ..., rk are the frequencies of each unique element (boys and girls). In this case, there are 3 boys and 3 girls, so r1 = r2 = 3.

Using this formula, we get:

6! / (3! \* 3!) = 720 / (6 \* 6) = 20 possible orders of births

Since there were 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G, and there are 20 possible orders of births, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Total number of families surveyed = (Number of families with G B G B B G) \* (Total number of possible orders) / (Number of possible orders with G B G B B G)

Since there are 6! / 3! ways to arrange G B G B B G (i.e., 120 ways), and there are 6! / (3! \* 3!) ways to arrange any sequence with 3 boys and 3 girls (i.e., 20 ways), the probability of the exact order G B G B B G is:

P(G B G B B G) = Number of ways to arrange G B G B B G / Total number of possible orders = 120 / 20 = 6

Therefore, the estimated total number of families surveyed is:

Total number of families surveyed = 45 \* 20 / 6 = 150

Now, we can use this estimate to calculate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B:

Number of families with B G B B B B = Total number of families surveyed \* P(B G B B B B)

Since P(B G B B B B) = 0.015625, we get:

Number of families with B G B B B B = 150 \* 0.015625 = 2.34375

However, since the number of families must be a whole number, we need to round this estimate to the nearest whole number. Therefore, our final estimate is:
