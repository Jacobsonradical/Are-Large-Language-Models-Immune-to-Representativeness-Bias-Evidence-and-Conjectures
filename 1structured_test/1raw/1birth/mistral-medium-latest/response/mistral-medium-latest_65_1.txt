To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each birth. However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in real-life scenarios.

With this assumption, we can calculate the probability of having a birth order of G B G B B G as follows:

P(GBGBBG) = P(G) \* P(B) \* P(G) \* P(B) \* P(B) \* P(G) = 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 = 0.015625

Similarly, we can calculate the probability of having a birth order of B G B B B B as follows:

P(BGBBBB) = P(B) \* P(G) \* P(B) \* P(B) \* P(B) \* P(B) = 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 = 0.015625

Since both birth orders have the same probability, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order of B G B B B B by multiplying the number of families with the birth order of G B G B B G by the ratio of the two probabilities. However, since both probabilities are equal, the ratio is 1:

Estimated number of families with birth order B G B B B B = Number of families with birth order G B G B B G \* 1

Estimated number of families with birth order B G B B B B = 45

Thus, our estimate is:
{answer: 45}
