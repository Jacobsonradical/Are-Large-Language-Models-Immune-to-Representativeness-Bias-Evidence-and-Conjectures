To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each gender. However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in real-world scenarios.

Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equal, and the order of births is independent of previous births. Therefore, the probability of any particular sequence of six births is:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64 â‰ˆ 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Total number of families = (Number of families with G B G B B G)/(Probability of G B G B B G)

Using the same logic, we can estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B:

Number of families with B G B B B B = (Total number of families) \* (Probability of B G B B B B)

Number of families with B G B B B B = (Total number of families) \* (1/2)^6

Since we don't know the exact total number of families surveyed, we can't calculate the exact number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B. However, we can use the number of families with G B G B B G as a proxy to estimate the total number of families.

Estimated total number of families = (Number of families with G B G B B G)/(Probability of G B G B B G)

Estimated total number of families = 45/(1/64) = 2880

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = (Estimated total number of families) \* (Probability of B G B B B B)

Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = 2880 \* (1/64) = 45

Therefore, our estimate is:
