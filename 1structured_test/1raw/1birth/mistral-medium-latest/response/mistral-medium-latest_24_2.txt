Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it's impossible to provide an accurate estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B. However, if we assume that birth order is random and that each family has an equal chance of having any particular birth order, then we can calculate an estimate based on the probability of a particular birth order.

The probability of having a boy or a girl is 0.5 for each birth. Therefore, the probability of having the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

0.5^6 = 0.015625 or approximately 1.56%

Since there were 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G, we can use this as a reference point to estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B. If we assume that the distribution of birth orders is uniform and that the number of families with each birth order is proportional to its probability, then we can estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B as follows:

(Number of families with G B G B B G) x (Probability of B G B B B B / Probability of G B G B B G)
= 45 x (0.5^6 / 0.5^6)
= 45 x (1 / 64)
= approximately 0.7 families

However, since it's not possible to have a fraction of a family, we can round up to the nearest whole number to get an estimate of 1 family.

Therefore, based on the available information and the assumption of a uniform distribution of birth orders, my estimate is:
