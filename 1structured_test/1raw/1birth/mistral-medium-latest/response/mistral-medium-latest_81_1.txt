To answer this question, we would need more information about the total number of families surveyed and the distribution of birth sequences. However, since that information is not provided, we can make an assumption based on the given data to estimate the number of families with the birth sequence B G B B B B.

Assuming that the birth sequences are equally likely, there are 7!/(6-2)!=42 possible sequences for a family with 6 children that has 2 girls and 4 boys. Since the birth sequence G B G B B G was observed in 45 families, we can estimate that each possible sequence would be observed in roughly 45/42 â‰ˆ 1.07 families. Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth sequence B G B B B B would be:

answer: 1.07 \* 42 / 6 = 7.52

However, since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number. Therefore, our final estimate is:

answer: 8 families
