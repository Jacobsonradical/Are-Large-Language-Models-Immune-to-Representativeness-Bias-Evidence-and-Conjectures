To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, as the problem does not provide any information about the ratio of boys to girls born in the city.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., 0.5 for each), we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of having a specific birth order.

The probability of having the exact order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the exact order G B G B B G, and assuming that the distribution of birth orders is random, we can estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B as follows:

Number of families with B G B B B B = Total number of families \* P(B G B B B B)

To estimate the total number of families surveyed, we can use the number of families with the G B G B B G order as a reference. Since there are 45 families with this order, and the probability of this order is:

P(G B G B B G) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

We can estimate the total number of families surveyed as:

Total number of families = 45 / P(G B G B B G) = 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2,874

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order B G B B B B is:

Number of families with B G B B B B = 2,874 \* 0.015625 ≈ 45

So the answer is:
{answer: 45}
