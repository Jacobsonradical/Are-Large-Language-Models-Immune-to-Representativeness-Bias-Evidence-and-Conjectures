To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability. Under this assumption, the order of births in a family of six children follows a multinomial distribution.

The probability of having the exact order of births G B G B B G is given by:

P(G B G B B G) = (1/2)^6 × 6! / (3! × 2! × 1!)

where the factorial terms account for the number of ways to arrange the boys and girls in the specified order.

Similarly, the probability of having the exact order of births B G B B B B is given by:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 × 6! / (4! × 1! × 1!)

Since the question asks for an estimate of the number of families with this order of births, we can use the probability to estimate the number of families based on the observed number of families with the order G B G B B G.

Let X be the random variable representing the number of families with the order B G B B B B, and let p be the probability of this order. Then:

E(X) = np

where n is the total number of families surveyed.

Since we know that there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and the probability of this order is the same as the probability of the order B G B B B B (assuming equal probability of boys and girls), we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed:

n = 45 / P(G B G B B G)

Substituting the expression for P(G B G B B G) from above:

n ≈ 45 / ((1/2)^6 × 6! / (3! × 2! × 1!))

n ≈ 45 / (0.015625)

n ≈ 2879 families

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

E(X) = np ≈ 2879 × (1/2)^6 × 6! / (4! × 1! × 1!)

E(X) ≈ 2879 × 0.0046875

E(X) ≈ 13.56

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number to get:

{answer: 14}

Therefore, our estimate is that there were approximately 14 families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.
