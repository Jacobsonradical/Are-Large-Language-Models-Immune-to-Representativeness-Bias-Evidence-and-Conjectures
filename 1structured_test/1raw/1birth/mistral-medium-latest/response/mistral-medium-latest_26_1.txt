To solve this problem, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is usually assumed to be equal (around 50% for each sex). However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate and the actual number of families with the exact order BGBBBB might be different.

Under the assumption of equal likelihood, the probability of having a boy or a girl is 1/2, so the probability of a particular birth order is (1/2)^6 for families with six children.

Since there were 45 families with the exact order GBGBBG, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Specifically, if we let N be the total number of families, then we can write the equation:

(1/2)^6 \* N = 45

Solving for N, we get:

N = 45 / (1/2)^6
N = 45 \* 64
N = 2880

Therefore, our estimate for the total number of families surveyed is 2880.

Using the same reasoning, the estimated number of families with the exact order BGBBBB is:

(1/2)^6 \* 2880
= 1/64 \* 2880
= 45

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order BGBBBB is 45.

So the answer is:
{answer: 45}
