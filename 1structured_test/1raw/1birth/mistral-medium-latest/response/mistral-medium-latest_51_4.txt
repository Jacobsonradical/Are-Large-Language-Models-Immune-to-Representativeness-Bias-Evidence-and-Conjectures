To solve this problem, we can use the concept of binomial probability.

First, let's calculate the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) in each birth. Since we are assuming equal probabilities for boys and girls, the probability of having a boy or a girl is 0.5 for each birth.

Next, we can calculate the probability of having the birth order "B G B B B B" by multiplying the probabilities of having a boy or a girl at each position:

Probability of B G B B B B = Probability of B * Probability of G * Probability of B * Probability of B * Probability of B * Probability of B
= 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.015625

Now, we know that there are 45 families with the birth order "G B G B B G", so we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Since the probability of having the birth order "G B G B B G" is also given by a binomial distribution with equal probabilities of boys and girls, we can calculate the expected number of families with this birth order as follows:

Expected number of families with G B G B B G = Total number of families * Probability of G B G B B G
= Total number of families * (0.5)^6 = 45

Solving for the total number of families, we get:

Total number of families = 45 / (0.5)^6 ≈ 32,768

Now, we can use this estimated total number of families to calculate the expected number of families with the birth order "B G B B B B":

Expected number of families with B G B B B B = Total number of families * Probability of B G B B B B
= 32,768 * 0.015625 ≈ 512.6

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number:

Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = 513

Therefore, the answer is:
{answer: 513}
