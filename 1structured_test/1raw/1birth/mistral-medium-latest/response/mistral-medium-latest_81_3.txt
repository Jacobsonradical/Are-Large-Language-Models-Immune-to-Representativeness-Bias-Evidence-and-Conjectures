To answer this question, we need to assume that the births of boys and girls are equally likely and occur independently of each other. Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy or a girl is 0.5.

The exact order of births G B G B B G occurs in 45 out of the total number of families surveyed. Let's denote the total number of families surveyed by N. Then, we have:

(0.5)^6 \* N = 45

Solving for N, we get:

N = 45 / (0.5)^6
N ≈ 45 \* 64
N ≈ 2880

Since we are assuming that births are independent and equally likely to be boys or girls, we can use the same logic to estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B. The probability of this sequence occurring is also (0.5)^6. Therefore, the estimated number of families with this sequence is:

(0.5)^6 \* N

Substituting the value of N obtained earlier, we get:

(0.5)^6 \* 2880
≈ 0.015625 \* 2880
≈ 45

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is approximately 45.
