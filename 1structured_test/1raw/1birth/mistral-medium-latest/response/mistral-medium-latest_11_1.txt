To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be equal (0.5 for each). However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in real-world scenarios.

Under this assumption, the order of births G B G B B G and B G B B B B are equally likely, as they both consist of six births with three boys and three girls. Therefore, if there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we would expect a similar number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

answer: My estimate is 45 families.
