To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions as the information provided doesn't directly help us estimate the number of families with the exact order of births BGBBBB.

Assumption 1: The birth order of boys and girls is random and follows a binomial distribution. In a family of six children, there are 720 (6!) possible birth orders.

Assumption 2: The ratio of births of boys to girls is approximately equal, meaning that the probability of having a boy or a girl is around 0.5.

Under these assumptions, we can calculate the probability of a specific birth order:

P(GBGBBB) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625 or 1.5625%

Since there are 45 families with the birth order GBGBBG, we can use this as a sample to estimate the total number of families surveyed (let's call it N):

45 / (N * 1.5625%) = 1

Solving for N, we get:

N ≈ 2,888.89

Since the number of families must be an integer, we can round it to the nearest whole number:

N ≈ 2,889

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB using the probability calculated earlier:

Number of families with BGBBBB birth order = N * P(BGBBBB)
                                                       = 2,889 * 0.015625%
                                                       ≈ 45

So, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was BGBBBB is:

answer: 45

Please note that this estimate is based on the assumptions made and may not be accurate if the assumptions are not valid.
