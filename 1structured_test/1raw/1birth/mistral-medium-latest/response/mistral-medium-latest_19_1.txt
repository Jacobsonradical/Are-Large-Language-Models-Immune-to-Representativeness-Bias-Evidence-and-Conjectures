This is a difficult question to answer without more information. The exact order of births in families is largely a matter of chance, and without knowing the overall distribution of birth orders in the city, it is impossible to give a precise estimate.

However, we can make a rough estimate based on the information provided. Since 45 out of the total number of families surveyed had the exact order of births G-B-G-B-B-G, we can assume that this is a relatively common birth order. Let's call the total number of families surveyed X.

If we assume that the distribution of birth orders is roughly random, then we might expect the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B to be about as common as the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G. However, it's worth noting that the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B is actually less likely than G-B-G-B-B-G, since it requires 5 out of 6 children to be boys, rather than 3 out of 6.

Based on these considerations, a rough estimate for the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B would be around (1/2) \* 45 = 22.5, but since we can't have half a family, we could round this up to 23. This is just a rough estimate, and the actual number could be higher or lower depending on the specific distribution of birth orders in the city.

answer: Our estimate is 23 families.
