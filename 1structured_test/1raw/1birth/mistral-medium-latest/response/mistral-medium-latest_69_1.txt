To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each. However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in real-life scenarios.

With this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equal, and the order of births is independent of previous births. Therefore, the probability of having a specific birth order for six children is always (0.5)^6, regardless of the specific order.

Since the problem asks for an estimate of the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can use the same probability of (0.5)^6 as in the case of the order G B G B B G. If there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, then the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B would also be:

answer: 45 families

Again, it's important to note that this estimate assumes that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal and independent of previous births, which may not be the case in real life.
