Without knowing the total number of families surveyed or the overall distribution of birth sequences, it's impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B. However, if we make the assumption that the birth sequences G B G B B G and B G B B B B are equally likely, then we could estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B sequence to be approximately equal to the number of families with the G B G B B G sequence.

Therefore, the estimate would be:
