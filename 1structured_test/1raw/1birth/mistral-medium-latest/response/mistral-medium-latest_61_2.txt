To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we can use the given information about the families with the order G B G B B G and assume that the distribution of birth sequences is random.

First, let's calculate the probability of a family having the birth order G B G B B G:

P(G B G B B G) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since there are 45 families with this birth order, the total number of families surveyed (N) can be estimated as:

N \* P(G B G B B G) = 45
N = 45 / (1/64) = 2880

Now, let's calculate the probability of a family having the birth order B G B B B B:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Using the estimated total number of families (2880) and the probability of the birth order B G B B B B, we can estimate the number of families with this birth order:

Number of families with B G B B B B = N \* P(B G B B B B) = 2880 \* (1/64) = 45

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is 45.

answer: 45
