To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, as it is not specified in the question. If we assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely (i.e., a 50% chance for each), then we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

The probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is 0.5, so the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is:

0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G:

45 / (0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5 \* 0.5) = 45 / 0.015625 = 2,872.73

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by multiplying the total number of families surveyed by the probability of having this birth order:

2,872.73 \* 0.015625 = 45

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}

Please note that this is an estimate based on the assumption of equal probabilities for boys and girls, and the actual number may differ depending on the population's sex ratio at birth.
