To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be roughly equal. Under this assumption, the order of births is purely a matter of chance.

The order G B G B B G has 3 girls and 3 boys, just like the order B G B B B B. Since the orders are equally balanced in terms of gender, we can assume that the probability of one order occurring is roughly the same as the probability of the other order occurring.

Therefore, if there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, our estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B would also be around 45.

answer: 45
