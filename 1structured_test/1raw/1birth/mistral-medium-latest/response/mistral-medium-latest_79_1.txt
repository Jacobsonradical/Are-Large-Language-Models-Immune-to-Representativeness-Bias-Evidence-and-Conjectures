To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl. Since there's no information suggesting otherwise, we can assume that the chances of having a boy or a girl are equal (50% each).

The probability of having a specific birth order with 6 children can be calculated as:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625

If there were 45 families with the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed and use it to find an approximation for the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B.

First, let's find an estimate for the total number of families surveyed (N):

Number of families with G-B-G-B-B-G = 45
Probability of G-B-G-B-B-G = 1/64

N \* (1/64) = 45
N ≈ 45 \* 64 ≈ 2880

Now that we have an estimate for the total number of families surveyed, we can calculate the estimated number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B:

Estimated number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B = N \* (1/64)
= 2880 \* (1/64)
≈ 45

So, the estimated number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B is around 45.

answer: 45
