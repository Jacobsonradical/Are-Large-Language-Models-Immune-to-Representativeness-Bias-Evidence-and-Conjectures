To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probabilities of having a boy or a girl. Since birth sex ratios are roughly equal, we can assume that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is approximately 0.5 for each birth.

Given that the exact order of births in question is B G B B B B, we can calculate the probability of this sequence occurring as follows:

P(B) \* P(G) \* P(B) \* P(B) \* P(B) \* P(B) = 0.5^6

Now, we know that there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G. Using the same logic as above, we can calculate the probability of this sequence occurring:

P(G) \* P(B) \* P(G) \* P(B) \* P(B) \* P(G) = 0.5^6

Since both probabilities are equal, we can assume that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B should also be approximately equal to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Therefore, our estimate is:

answer: 45
