To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl. Since the birth of a boy or a girl is typically considered a random event with equal probability, we can assume that each birth has a 50% chance of being a boy and a 50% chance of being a girl.

Under this assumption, the probability of a specific birth order occurring is the product of the probabilities of each individual birth in that order. Since there are six births in each family, the probability of any specific birth order is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Therefore, if there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by multiplying the total number of families surveyed by the probability of that birth order.

However, we do not know the total number of families surveyed, so we cannot directly calculate the estimate. Instead, we can use the information about the 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G to make an educated guess.

Since there are 45 families with that birth order, out of the total number of families surveyed, we can assume that the probability of that birth order occurring is approximately 45 / total number of families. Since the probability of that birth order occurring is (0.5)^6, we can set up the following equation:

45 / total number of families = (0.5)^6

Solving for the total number of families, we get:

total number of families ≈ 45 / (0.5)^6 ≈ 24416

Since this is only an estimate, it is likely that the actual number of families surveyed is different from this value. However, based on this estimate, we can calculate the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

estimated number of families = total number of families × probability of birth order B G B B B B

= 24416 × (0.5)^6

= 24416 × 0.015625

= 381.4

Since it is not possible to have a fraction of a family, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number. Therefore, our estimate is:

answer: 381
