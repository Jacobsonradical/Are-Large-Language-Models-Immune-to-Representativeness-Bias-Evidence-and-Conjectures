To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be about 50% for each. With this assumption, the probability of a particular birth order is the same for all sequences of the same length. Therefore, if there were 45 families with the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, we would expect a similar number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B.

So, our estimate would be:
{answer: 45}
