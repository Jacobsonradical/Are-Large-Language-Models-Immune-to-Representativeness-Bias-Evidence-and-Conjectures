To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be about 50% for each. However, it's important to note that this may not be accurate in reality.

Assuming equal probabilities for boys and girls, the probability of a particular birth order of six children is:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed:

Total families = 45 / (Probability of G B G B B G) = 45 / (1/64) = 2880

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B using the same probability:

Number of families = Total families * Probability of B G B B B B
= 2880 * (1/2)^6
= 45

Therefore, our estimate is:
{answer: 45 families}
