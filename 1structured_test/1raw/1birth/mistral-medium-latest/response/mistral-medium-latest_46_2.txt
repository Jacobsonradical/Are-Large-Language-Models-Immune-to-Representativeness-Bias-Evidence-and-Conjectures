To solve this problem, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (50% chance for each). Then, the order of births in a family follows a binomial distribution.

First, let's calculate the probability of having the exact order G B G B B G:
P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625 (since each birth has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl, and there are 6 births)

Next, let's find out the number of families with this order:
Number of families with G B G B B G = 45

Now, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:
Estimated total families = Number of families with G B G B B G / P(G B G B B G)
= 45 / 0.015625
≈ 2875.39

Since the number of families must be an integer, we can round it to the nearest whole number:
2876 families

Finally, let's calculate the probability of having the exact order B G B B B B:
P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625 (same as before)

Now, we can estimate the number of families with this order:
Number of families with B G B B B B = Estimated total families \* P(B G B B B B)
= 2876 \* 0.015625
≈ 45.06

Again, rounding to the nearest whole number:
45 families

So, the estimated number of families surveyed with the exact order B G B B B B is 45.
