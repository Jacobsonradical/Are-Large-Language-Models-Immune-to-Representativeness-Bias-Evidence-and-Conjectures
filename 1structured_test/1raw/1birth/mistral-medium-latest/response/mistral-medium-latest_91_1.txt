To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% each. However, it's important to note that this assumption might not hold true for the specific population in question.

With that said, let's reason through the problem:

1. The exact order of births G B G B B G occurred in 45 families.
2. We want to find an estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.
3. Since the likelihood of having a boy or a girl is assumed to be 50%, we can treat each birth as an independent event with a probability of 0.5 for boy or girl.
4. Therefore, the probability of the exact order of births G B G B B G is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, or approximately 1.5625% chance for any given family.
5. Similarly, the probability of the exact order of births B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, or approximately 1.5625% chance for any given family.
6. Since both orders of birth have the same probability, we can assume that the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B would also be approximately the same as the number of families with the exact order of births G B G B B G.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed with the exact order of births B G B B B B is also around 45.

answer: 45
