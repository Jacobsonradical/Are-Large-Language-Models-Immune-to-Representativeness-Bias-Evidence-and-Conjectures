To answer this question, we need to make an assumption of equal probability for the birth of a boy or a girl. Under this assumption, the probability of a boy or girl being born is 0.5.

The birth sequence G B G B B G has 6 births with 3 boys and 3 girls, while the sequence B G B B B B has 6 births with 5 boys and 1 girl. Both sequences have the same number of births, so the difference lies in the distribution of boys and girls.

Assuming equal probability, the probability of the sequence B G B B B B is (0.5)^5 \* (0.5)^1 = 0.03125, which is lower than that of the sequence G B G B B G, which is (0.5)^3 \* (0.5)^3 = 0.0625.

Given that there were 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B as follows:

(Number of families with G B G B B G) \* (Probability of B G B B B B / Probability of G B G B B G)

= 45 \* (0.03125 / 0.0625)

= 45 \* 0.5

= 22.5

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number, which is 23.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:

answer: 23
