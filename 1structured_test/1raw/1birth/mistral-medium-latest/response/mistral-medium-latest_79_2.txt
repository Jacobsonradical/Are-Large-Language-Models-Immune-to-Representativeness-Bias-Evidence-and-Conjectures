To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is usually assumed to be 50% for each. Under this assumption, the order of births G B G B B G and B G B B B B are equally likely.

Therefore, if there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we would expect a similar number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. So the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also around 45.

answer: 45
