Unfortunately, without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it's impossible to provide an accurate estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B. The information provided only tells us about families with the order G B G B B G. Therefore, my answer would be:

{answer: I cannot determine an estimate based on the information provided.}

However, if you assume that birth orders are equally likely and there are no other constraints, you could make an educated guess based on the probability of a particular birth order. Since there are 720 possible birth orders for six children (6 factorial), the probability of any specific birth order is 1/720. If we assume that this probability applies to the surveyed families, then we could estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by multiplying the total number of surveyed families by the probability of this birth order. But without knowing the total number of surveyed families, this estimate would still be incomplete.
