To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions as the information provided does not give us a direct way to calculate the estimate.

Assumption 1: The birth order of boys and girls is random in the city.
Assumption 2: The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).

Given these assumptions, the probability of having a specific birth order for six children is:

P(BBGGBB) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Since there are 45 families with the exact order G-B-G-B-B-G, we can use this number to estimate the total number of families surveyed:

Total families = 45 / P(BBGGBB) ≈ 2,879

Now, we want to find an estimate of the number of families with the exact order B-G-B-B-B-B. Using the same probability calculation as before:

P(BGBBBB) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

So, our estimate would be:

Number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B order = Total families * P(BGBBBB) ≈ 2,879 * 0.015625 ≈ 45

However, it's essential to note that this estimation is based on several assumptions, and the actual number might differ.

answer:
{answer: 45}
