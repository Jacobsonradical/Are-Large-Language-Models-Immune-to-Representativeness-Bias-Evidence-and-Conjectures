To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability. Under this assumption, the order of births follows a binomial distribution.

Since there are six children in each family, there are $2^6 = 64$ possible orders of births, assuming that each child is either a boy or a girl.

According to the problem, there are 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G. Since the birth of a boy or a girl is assumed to be a random event with equal probability, the probability of this particular sequence is:

P(G B G B B G) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since there are 45 families with this sequence out of the total number of families surveyed, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Number of families surveyed = 45 / P(G B G B B G) = 45 / (1/64) = 2880

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

Number of families with B G B B B B = Number of families surveyed \* P(B G B B B B) = 2880 \* (1/2)^6 = 45

Therefore, the answer is:

{answer: 45}

This estimate assumes that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability and that the sample of families surveyed is representative of the entire population of families with six children in the city. If these assumptions are not valid, then the estimate may not be accurate.
