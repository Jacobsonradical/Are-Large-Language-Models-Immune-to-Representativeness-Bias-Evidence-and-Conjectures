To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 0.5 for each. However, without more information about the distribution of birth orders in the population, it's difficult to provide an accurate estimate.

That being said, if we assume that the birth of each child is independent and has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, then the probability of a particular birth order can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual birth.

Under this assumption, the probability of the birth order G B G B B G is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, or approximately 1.56%. Since there were 45 families with this birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as:

total families = 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2875.6

Since this is not a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number to get an estimate of 2876 families.

Using the same logic, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, or approximately 1.56%. Therefore, our estimate of the number of families with this birth order is:

families with B G B B B B = total families \* 0.015625 ≈ 2876 \* 0.015625 ≈ 45

Therefore, our estimate is:

answer: 45 families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.
