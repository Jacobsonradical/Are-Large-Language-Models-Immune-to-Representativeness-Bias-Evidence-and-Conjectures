To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be about 50% for each sex.

Since the exact order of births in the second scenario is B G B B B B, we can use the binomial probability formula to estimate the probability of this occurrence:

P(X=k) = C(n,k) \* p^k \* q^(n-k)

Where:

* P(X=k) is the probability of k successes (having a boy) in n trials (births)
* C(n,k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time
* p is the probability of success (having a boy), which is 0.5
* q is the probability of failure (having a girl), which is 1-p, or 0.5

In this case, n=6 and k=5 (since there are 5 boys and 1 girl), so:

P(X=5) = C(6,5) \* 0.5^5 \* 0.5^1
P(X=5) = 6 \* 0.03125 \* 0.5
P(X=5) = 0.09375

This means that the probability of having the exact order B G B B B B is about 9.375% for families with six children.

Since we know that there were 45 families with the exact order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed.

Let's call the total number of families surveyed N. Then:

45/N = P(G B G B B G)

We can estimate P(G B G B B G) using the same binomial probability formula as before, with n=6 and k=3 (since there are 3 girls and 3 boys):

P(X=3) = C(6,3) \* 0.5^3 \* 0.5^3
P(X=3) = 20 \* 0.125 \* 0.125
P(X=3) ≈ 0.3125

So:

45/N ≈ 0.3125
N ≈ 45 / 0.3125
N ≈ 144

Therefore, we estimate that there were about 144 families surveyed in total.

Using the probability of having the exact order B G B B B B that we calculated earlier, we can estimate the number of families with this order:

Number of families with B G B B B B = N \* P(B G B B B B)
Number of families with B G B B B B ≈ 144 \* 0.09375
Number of families with B G B B B B ≈ 13.5

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number:

answer: 14
