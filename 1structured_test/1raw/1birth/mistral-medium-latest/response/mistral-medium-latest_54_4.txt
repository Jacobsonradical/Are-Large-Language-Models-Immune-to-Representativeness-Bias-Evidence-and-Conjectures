To answer this question, we would need more information about the overall distribution of birth orders in the families. However, since we don't have that information, we can make an assumption based on the given data.

Since there were 45 families with the exact order of births G-B-G-B-B-G, and we are looking for the number of families with the exact order of births B-G-B-B-B-B, we can assume that the probability of a boy being born is the same as the probability of a girl being born (0.5).

Under this assumption, the probability of the exact order B-G-B-B-B-B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625. Therefore, our estimate of the number of families with this birth order is:

(total number of families) \* (probability of B-G-B-B-B-B)

We don't know the total number of families surveyed, so we can't calculate an exact answer. However, our estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B-G-B-B-B-B is:

{answer: 0.015625 \* total number of families}
