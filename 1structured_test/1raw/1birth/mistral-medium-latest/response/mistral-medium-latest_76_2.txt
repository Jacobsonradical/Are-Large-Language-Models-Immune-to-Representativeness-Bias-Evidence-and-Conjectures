To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% each. However, without more information about the birth rates in the city or any other factors that might influence the birth order, it's impossible to provide an accurate estimate.

Nevertheless, if we assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability, then the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) in each birth is 0.5. Therefore, the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this as a baseline to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. If we assume that the probability of having a certain birth order is the same for all families, then we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

Estimated number of families = (Number of families with G B G B B G) x (Probability of B G B B B B / Probability of G B G B B G)

Probability of G B G B B G = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Therefore,
Estimated number of families = 45 x (0.015625 / 0.015625) = 45

However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate based on the assumption of equal probability of having a boy or a girl, and the actual number of families with the birth order B G B B B B may be different.
