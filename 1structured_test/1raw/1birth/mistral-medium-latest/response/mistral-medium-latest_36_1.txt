To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, as there is no information provided about the ratio of boys to girls born in the city. If we assume that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equal (0.5 for each), then we can use the same statistical principles to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

The birth order G B G B B G can be represented as a sequence of 6 independent Bernoulli trials with success probability 0.5 for each trial. Similarly, the birth order B G B B B B can be represented as a different sequence of 6 independent Bernoulli trials with the same success probability 0.5. Since the two sequences have the same length and the same probability of success for each trial, the probability of observing each sequence is:

P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625
P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Given that there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (N) using the following equation:

45 = N \* P(G B G B B G)
N = 45 / P(G B G B B G)
N = 45 / 0.015625
N ≈ 2878.75

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round N to the nearest whole number, which is 2879.

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B (X) using the following equation:

X = N \* P(B G B B B B)
X = 2879 \* 0.015625
X ≈ 45

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is approximately 45.

answer: {answer: 45}
