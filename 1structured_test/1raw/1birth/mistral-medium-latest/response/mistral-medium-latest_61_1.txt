To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 0.5 for each birth. However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate, and the actual number of families could be different.

Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) in each birth is independent and identical. Therefore, the probability of having the exact order of births G B G B B G is the same as the probability of having the order B G B B B B, which is:

0.5^6 = 0.015625

Since there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Let N be the total number of families surveyed. Then, the expected number of families with the order G B G B B G is:

N \* 0.015625

We are given that this number is 45, so we have:

45 = N \* 0.015625

Solving for N, we get:

N = 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2877.34

Since the number of families must be an integer, we can round this estimate to the nearest integer to get:

N ≈ 2877

Therefore, if the probability of having a boy or a girl is 0.5 for each birth, then our estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

0.015625 \* 2877 ≈ 45

answer: {answer: 45}
