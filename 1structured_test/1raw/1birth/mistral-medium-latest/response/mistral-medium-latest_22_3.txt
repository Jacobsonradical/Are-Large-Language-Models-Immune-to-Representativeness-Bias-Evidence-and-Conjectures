To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl. In the absence of any other information, let's assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50% each). Then, we can treat the birth sequence as a binomial process with 6 trials (births) and a probability of success (having a boy) of 1/2.

The number of families with the exact birth order "B G B B B B" can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:

P(X=k) = C(n, k) \* (p^k) \* ((1-p)^(n-k))

where:

* P(X=k) is the probability of having k successes (boys) in n trials (births)
* C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose k successes from n trials
* p is the probability of success (having a boy)
* n is the number of trials (births)

In this case, we want to find the number of families with k=6 boys and n=6 births, so:

P(X=6) = C(6, 6) \* (0.5^6) \* ((1-0.5)^(6-6))
P(X=6) = 1 \* (0.5^6) \* (1^0)
P(X=6) = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the birth order "G B G B B G", if we assume that the distribution of birth orders is uniform across all families of six children, then we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Total families = 45 / P(X=3)

where X=3 corresponds to the birth order "G B G B B G". Using the binomial probability formula, we can calculate:

P(X=3) = C(6, 3) \* (0.5^3) \* ((1-0.5)^(6-3))
P(X=3) = 20 \* (0.5^3) \* (0.5^3)
P(X=3) = 0.3125

Therefore:

Total families = 45 / 0.3125
Total families ≈ 144

Now we can estimate the number of families with the birth order "B G B B B B" as follows:

Number of families = Total families \* P(X=6)
Number of families ≈ 144 \* 0.015625
Number of families ≈ 2.24

Since we can't have a fraction of a family, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number:
