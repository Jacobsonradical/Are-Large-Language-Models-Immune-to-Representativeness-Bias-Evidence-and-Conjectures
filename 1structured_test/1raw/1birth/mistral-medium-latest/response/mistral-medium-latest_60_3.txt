To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, since the question does not provide any information on this.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., 0.5 for each), we can calculate the probability of a particular birth order.

The probability of the birth order G B G B B G is:

P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Similarly, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Since both probabilities are equal, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by multiplying the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G by the ratio of the two birth orders:

Estimated number of families with birth order B G B B B B = Number of families with birth order G B G B B G \* (Number of possible birth orders with 6 children / Number of possible birth orders with the birth order G B G B B G)

There are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders with 6 children. There are 6! / (3! \* 3!) = 20 possible birth orders with the birth order G B G B B G. Therefore, the ratio of the two birth orders is 64 / 20 = 3.2.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a family, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, our estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

answer: 45 families \* 3 = 135 families
