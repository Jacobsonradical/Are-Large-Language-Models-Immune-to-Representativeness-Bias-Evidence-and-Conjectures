Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it's impossible to provide an accurate estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

However, if we assume that the birth order is completely random and that boys and girls are equally likely to be born, then we can make an educated guess.

Under these assumptions, the probability of having a boy or a girl is 0.5, and the probability of a particular birth order is (0.5)^6 for six children. Therefore, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 or approximately 1.56%.

If we further assume that the 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G are representative of the overall distribution of birth orders, we can estimate that there are approximately 45 / 0.015625 = 2,878 families in total.

Therefore, based on these assumptions, we can estimate that there are approximately 2,878 \* 0.015625 = 45 families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

answer: {answer: 45}
