Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

However, if we assume that the birth orders are random and equally likely, we can use the information provided about the birth order G B G B B G to make a rough estimate.

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, and this order has 3 boys and 3 girls in total, we can assume that the probability of having 3 boys and 3 girls in any order is approximately 45 / (total number of families surveyed).

Similarly, the birth order B G B B B B has 5 boys and 1 girl, so the probability of having this order is also approximately (number of families with this order) / (total number of families surveyed).

Since the probability of having 3 boys and 3 girls is the same as the probability of having 5 boys and 1 girl (assuming random and equal likelihood), we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to be approximately equal to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, which is 45.

Therefore, my estimate is:
{answer: 45}
