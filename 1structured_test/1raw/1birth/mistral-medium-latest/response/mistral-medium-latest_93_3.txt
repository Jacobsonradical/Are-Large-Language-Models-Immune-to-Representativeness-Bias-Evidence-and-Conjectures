To solve this problem, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, since the question does not provide any information about the birth rates of boys and girls in the city.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., 0.5 for each), we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of having a specific birth order.

The probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) in a particular birth can be represented as a binomial distribution with n trials and a probability of success (p) of 0.5. The probability of having a specific birth order of k boys in n births can be calculated using the following formula:

P(X=k) = C(n,k) \* p^k \* (1-p)^(n-k)

where C(n,k) is the combination of n items taken k at a time, calculated as n! / (k!\*(n-k)!)

In this case, we want to find the probability of having the exact order of births B G B B B B in a family of six children. Using the formula above, we can calculate:

P(X=5) = C(6,5) \* 0.5^5 \* 0.5^1
            = 6 \* 0.03125 \* 0.5
            = 0.09375

Since the probability of having the exact order of births B G B B B B is 0.09375, we can estimate the number of families surveyed with this birth order by multiplying the total number of families surveyed by this probability.

However, the question does not provide the total number of families surveyed, so we cannot calculate an exact estimate. If we assume that the sample of 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G is representative of the population of all families with six children, then we can use this sample to estimate the total number of families surveyed.

The sample size of 45 families represents approximately 0.03% of the population of families with six children in the United States (based on census data for 2020). Therefore, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed in the city by dividing the number of families in the sample by 0.03%.

45 / 0.03% = 150,000 families

Using this estimate, we can calculate the estimated number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

Estimated number of families = Total number of families surveyed \* Probability of birth order
                                             = 150,000 \* 0.09375
                                             = 14,062.5

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number:

Estimated number of families = 14,063

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed with the exact order of births B G B B B B is 14,063.
