To answer this question, we would need more information about the total number of families surveyed and the distribution of birth orders in the city. Without this information, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate.

However, if we assume that the distribution of birth orders is random and that each possible birth order is equally likely, then we can calculate the probability of a particular birth order occurring.

There are 720 possible birth orders for six children (since there are 6! ways to arrange six distinct items). The probability of a particular birth order occurring is therefore 1/720.

Since there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of that birth order occurring. This gives us an estimate of 45 \* 720 = 32,400 families surveyed.

Using the same reasoning, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

Number of families with birth order B G B B B B = Total number of families surveyed \* Probability of birth order B G B B B B
= 32,400 \* (1/720)
= 45

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 45.
