Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B. If you have that information, I would be happy to help you calculate an estimate based on it.

However, if we assume that the distribution of birth orders is random, we can make an educated guess. Given that there are 45 families with the exact order G B G B B G, and assuming that each possible birth order is equally likely, there are 7!/(6!*2!) = 7 possible birth orders with 6 children, since the genders are either boy or girl.

Therefore, we can estimate that the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 45 / 7 â‰ˆ 6.43}

Since it is not possible to have a fraction of a family, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number. However, please note that this is a rough estimate and may not be accurate if the distribution of birth orders is not random.
