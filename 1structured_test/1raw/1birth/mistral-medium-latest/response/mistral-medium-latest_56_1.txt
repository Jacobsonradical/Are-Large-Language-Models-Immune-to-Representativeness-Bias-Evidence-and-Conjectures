To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each. However, it's important to note that this is an assumption and may not reflect the true distribution of births in this city.

Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability, we can calculate the probability of a particular birth order occurring. The probability of a sequence of six births in the order G B G B B G is:

P(G B G B B G) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Similarly, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since both birth orders have the same probability, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by multiplying the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G by the ratio of the two probabilities:

Number of families with B G B B B B = Number of families with G B G B B G * (P(B G B B B B) / P(G B G B B G))

Since the probability of both birth orders is the same, the ratio of the probabilities is 1. Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to be:

Number of families with B G B B B B = 45 * (1/1) = 45

Therefore, the answer is:

{answer: 45}
