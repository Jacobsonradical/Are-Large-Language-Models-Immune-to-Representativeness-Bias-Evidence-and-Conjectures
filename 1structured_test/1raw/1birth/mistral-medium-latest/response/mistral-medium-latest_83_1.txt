To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is roughly equal in a population. However, without more information about the specific city's birth rates or any other relevant factors, it's impossible to provide an exact estimate.

Nevertheless, assuming equal probabilities for boys and girls, we can use the provided information to make a rough estimate. Since there were 45 families with the order G-B-G-B-B-G, and the total number of births in those families was 6 \* 45 = 270, we can calculate the probability of the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G as:

P(G-B-G-B-B-G) = Number of families with G-B-G-B-B-G / Total number of possible birth orders

Since there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders for six children, and we know that 45 families had the G-B-G-B-B-G order, the probability of this specific order is:

P(G-B-G-B-B-G) = 45 / (64 \* Total number of families)

Solving for the total number of families, we get:

Total number of families ≈ 45 \* (64 / P(G-B-G-B-B-G))

Now, to estimate the number of families with the order B-G-B-B-B-B, we can use the same probability formula, but with the new birth order:

P(B-G-B-B-B-B) = Number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B / Total number of families

Assuming equal probabilities for all birth orders, we can say that:

P(G-B-G-B-B-G) = P(B-G-B-B-B-B)

Therefore:

Number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B ≈ Total number of families \* P(B-G-B-B-B-B)

Number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B ≈ Total number of families \* P(G-B-G-B-B-G)

Number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B ≈ Total number of families \* (45 / (64 \* Total number of families))

Solving for the number of families with the order B-G-B-B-B-B, we get:

Number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B ≈ 45 \* (64 / 64)

Number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B ≈ 45

However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and assumes equal probabilities for all birth orders. In reality, the actual number of families with the order B-G-B-B-B-B could be different.

answer: My estimate is 45 families.
