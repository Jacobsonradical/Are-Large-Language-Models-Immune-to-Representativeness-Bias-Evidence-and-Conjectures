To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% each. However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate and the actual number may vary.

Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equal, so the probability of a particular birth order is simply the product of the probabilities of each individual birth in that order.

For the birth order G B G B B G, the probability is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, since there are 6 births and each has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl.

Since there were 45 families with this birth order out of the total number of families surveyed, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Total families = 45 / (1/64) = 2880

Assuming that the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64, we can estimate the number of families with this birth order as:

Number of families = Total families \* Probability of birth order B G B B B B
= 2880 \* (1/64)
= 45

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed with the exact order of births B G B B B B is 45.

{answer: 45}
