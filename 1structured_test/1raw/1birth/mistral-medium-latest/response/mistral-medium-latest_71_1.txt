To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probabilities (0.5 for each gender). Under this assumption, the order of births in a family of six children follows a binomial distribution.

The probability of having the exact order "G B G B B G" is:

P(G B G B B G) = (0.5)^6 \* 6! / (3! \* 3!) = 0.0546875

where 6! / (3! \* 3!) is the number of ways to arrange 3 boys and 3 girls in a sequence of 6 births.

Since there are 45 families with this exact order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (N) by solving the equation:

45 = N \* P(G B G B B G)

N = 45 / P(G B G B B G) = 45 / 0.0546875 ≈ 823.1

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the exact order "B G B B B B". The probability of having this order is:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 \* 6! / (5! \* 1!) = 0.03125

So, the estimated number of families with this exact order is:

Estimated number of families = N \* P(B G B B B B) ≈ 823.1 \* 0.03125 ≈ 25.7

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 26.
