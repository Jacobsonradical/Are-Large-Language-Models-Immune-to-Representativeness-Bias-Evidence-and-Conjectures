To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each. However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in real life.

Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equal, so the probability of having a particular birth order is the same for all sequences of six births. Since there are 2^6 = 64 possible sequences of births (assuming equal probabilities of having a boy or a girl), each sequence should have an equal probability of 1/64.

Therefore, if 45 families had the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, we would expect a similar number of families to have the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B, assuming that the sample size is large enough and the birth order is truly random. The exact number would depend on the total number of families surveyed, which is not given in the question.

However, based on the information provided, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B as follows:

1. The probability of having the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B is 1/64, assuming equal probabilities of having a boy or a girl.
2. Since there are 45 families with the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, we can use this as a baseline to estimate the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B.
3. If we assume that the birth order is truly random and that the probability of having a particular birth order is the same for all sequences, then the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B should be approximately equal to the number of families with the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, divided by the number of possible birth order sequences (which is 64).
4. Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B is: 45 / 64 â‰ˆ 0.70 families.

However, since it's not possible to have a fraction of a family, we would round this estimate to the nearest whole number. Since 0.70 is closer to 1 than to 0, we would round up to 1 family.

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B is:

answer: 1 family
