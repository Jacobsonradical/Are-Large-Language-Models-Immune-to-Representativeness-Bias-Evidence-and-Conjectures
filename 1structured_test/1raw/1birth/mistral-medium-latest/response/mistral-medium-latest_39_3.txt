To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each. However, without more information about the specific population or any trends in family sizes, it's impossible to give an accurate estimate.

Assuming an equal probability of having a boy or a girl, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B would be the same as the probability of the birth order G B G B B G, which is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 or 1.5625% chance for each family of six children.

If there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, and assuming that all birth orders are equally likely, we could estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Let N be the total number of families surveyed.
Then, N \* 1.5625% = 45.
Solving for N, we get N ≈ 2878.

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B would also be 1.5625% of the total number of families surveyed, which is 1.5625% \* 2878 ≈ 45 families.

However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate based on the assumption of equal probability, and the actual number of families with the birth order B G B B B B could be different depending on various factors.

answer: {answer: 45}
