To answer this question, we would need more information about the total number of families surveyed and the distribution of birth orders. However, since that information is not provided, we can only make an estimate based on the assumption that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely and independent of previous births.

Under this assumption, the probability of a boy being born is 0.5, and the probability of a girl being born is also 0.5. Therefore, the probability of a particular birth order (such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is simply the product of the probabilities of each individual birth in that order.

Since there are six births in each family, and each birth has a probability of 0.5, the probability of any particular birth order is:

0.5^6 = 0.015625

Therefore, if we assume that the 45 families with birth order G B G B B G are a representative sample of all families in the city, we can estimate the number of families with birth order B G B B B B as follows:

First, we can calculate the expected number of families with birth order B G B B B B based on the probability of this birth order:

Expected number = Total number of families x Probability of birth order

Since we don't know the total number of families surveyed, we can't calculate the expected number directly. However, we can calculate the ratio of the expected number of families with birth order B G B B B B to the number of families with birth order G B G B B G:

Ratio = (Probability of birth order B G B B B B) / (Probability of birth order G B G B B G)

Since both probabilities are equal to 0.015625, the ratio is 1:

Ratio = 1

This means that, on average, we would expect to see the same number of families with birth order B G B B B B as with birth order G B G B B G.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families with birth order B G B B B B is:

answer: 45
