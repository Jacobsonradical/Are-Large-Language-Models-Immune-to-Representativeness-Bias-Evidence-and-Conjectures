To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each. However, without more information about the birth patterns in this city, it's difficult to make a precise estimate.

Assuming that the births of boys and girls are independent events and that the probability of having a boy or a girl is always 50%, we can calculate the probability of a particular birth order.

The probability of the birth order G B G B B G is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, since there are six births and each one has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl. Similarly, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Given that there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. If we assume that the 45 families represent 0.015625 \* N, where N is the total number of families surveyed, then we can solve for N:

N = 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2,873

Using the same assumption about the probability of a particular birth order, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

Number of families = (0.015625) \* N = 0.015625 \* 2,873 ≈ 45

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is approximately 45.
