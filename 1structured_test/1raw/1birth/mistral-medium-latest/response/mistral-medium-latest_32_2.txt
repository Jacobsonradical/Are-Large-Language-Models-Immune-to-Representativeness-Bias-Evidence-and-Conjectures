To answer this question, I will assume that the births of boys and girls are equally likely and occur independently of each other. With these assumptions, we can calculate a rough estimate.

There are 7! (7 factorial) or 5,040 different possible orders for the births of six children. Out of these possibilities, there are also 7!/(2! \* 2! \* 3!) = 105 ways to have the exact order G B G B B G, since there are 2 girls and 2 boys in the first three places, and 3 boys in the last three places, and we divide by 2! twice to account for the repeated genders.

Given that 45 families out of the total surveyed had the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:

(45 families) / (105 possible orders / 5040 total orders) = 226 families

Now we can find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

(7!/(1! \* 1! \* 5!)) \* 226 families = 504 families / 120 = 4.2 families

Since we can't have a fraction of a family, I would round up to the nearest whole number:

{answer: 5 families}
