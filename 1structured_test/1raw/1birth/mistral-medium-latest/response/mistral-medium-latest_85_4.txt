The information provided about the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G does not directly help us estimate the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B. Without knowing the total number of families surveyed or any additional information about the distribution of birth orders, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate. If you have more context or data, please let me know, and I will do my best to help you.

However, if we make the assumption that all possible birth orders are equally likely (which may not be true), there are 720 (6!) possible birth orders for six children. Since we know that 45 families have the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, we could estimate the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B as follows:

(Number of families with birth order B-G-B-B-B-B) / (Number of families with birth order G-B-G-B-B-G) = (Number of possible birth orders) / (Number of possible birth orders)

Let x be the number of families with the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B. Then:

x / 45 = 1

x = 45

Under this assumption, the estimate would be:

{answer: 45}

Again, please note that this is a rough estimate based on the assumption of equal likelihood of all birth orders, and it might not accurately represent the real situation if other factors are at play.
