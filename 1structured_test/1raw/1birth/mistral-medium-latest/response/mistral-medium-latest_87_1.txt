To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each. However, without more information about the birth rates in the city, this assumption may not be accurate.

Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with a probability of 0.5 for each, we can calculate the probability of having a specific birth order. The probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, or approximately 1.56%.

Since there were 45 families with this birth order out of the total number of families surveyed, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Total number of families = 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2876.9

Using the same assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6 = 0.015625. Therefore, the estimated number of families with this birth order is:

Number of families with B G B B B B = Total number of families \* Probability of B G B B B B
= 2876.9 \* 0.015625
≈ 45

Therefore, our estimate is:
{answer: 45 families}
