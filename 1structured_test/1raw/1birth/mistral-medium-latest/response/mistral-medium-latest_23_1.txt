Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B. However, if we assume that the distribution of birth orders is random, then we can calculate the probability of a particular birth order and estimate the number of families based on that.

The probability of a particular birth order is determined by the number of boys and girls in the family and the number of possible arrangements of those boys and girls. For a family of six children with three boys and three girls, there are 20 possible arrangements (6! / (3! \* 3!)). Since the probability of a boy or a girl being born is assumed to be 0.5, the probability of each arrangement is the same.

Therefore, the probability of the birth order G B G B B G is 1/20, and the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also 1/20.

If we know that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, and we assume that the distribution of birth orders is random, then we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

Let X be the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
Let n be the total number of families surveyed.

We know that:

(1/20) \* n = 45 (for the birth order G B G B B G)

and we want to estimate:

(1/20) \* n = X (for the birth order B G B B B B)

Since the probabilities of the two birth orders are the same, we can assume that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also proportional to the total number of families surveyed. Therefore, we can estimate X as follows:

X = (45 / 1) \* (1/20)

X = 2.25

Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a family, we can round X to the nearest whole number. Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
