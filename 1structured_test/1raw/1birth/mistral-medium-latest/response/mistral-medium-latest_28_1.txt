To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be equal (0.5 for each). However, it's important to note that this assumption may not be accurate in real-world situations.

Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy or a girl is independent for each birth. Therefore, the probability of having a specific birth order is simply the product of the probabilities of each individual birth in that order.

For the birth order G B G B B G, the probability is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, since there are six births and each has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl.

Since there were 45 families with this birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing the number of families with this birth order by the probability of this birth order: 45 / 0.015625 â‰ˆ 2869.

Now, for the birth order B G B B B B, the probability is also (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, since there are also six births and each has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl.

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with this birth order is (0.015625 \* 2869) = 45, which is the same as the number of families with the G B G B B G birth order.

However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate, and the actual number of families with this birth order may be different due to random variations and other factors.

{answer: 45}
