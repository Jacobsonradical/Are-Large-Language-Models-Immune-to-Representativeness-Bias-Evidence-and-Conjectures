To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl. Since the birth of a boy or a girl is typically considered a random event with equal probability, we can assume that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is 0.5.

Under this assumption, the probability of having the exact birth order G B G B B G is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625, since there are six births and each one has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl.

If 45 families had this birth order, then the total number of families surveyed can be estimated as follows:

Let N be the total number of families surveyed.
The number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is 45.
Therefore, 45/N = (0.5)^6, and N = 45 / (0.5)^6 = 16,384 families.

Using the same logic, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

Number of families = (0.5)^6 \* Total number of families surveyed
= (0.5)^6 \* 16,384
= 32

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is approximately 32.

answer: {answer: 32}
