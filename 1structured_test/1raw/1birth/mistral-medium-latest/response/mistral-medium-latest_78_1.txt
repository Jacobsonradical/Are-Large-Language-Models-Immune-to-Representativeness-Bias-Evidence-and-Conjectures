To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% each. However, without more information about the birth patterns in the city or any other relevant factors, this assumption might not be accurate.

With that said, if we assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability, then the probability of having a particular birth order of six children is:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G-B-G-B-B-G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

45 / (1/64) ≈ 2,906.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a family, we'll round this number up to the nearest whole number, which is 2,907.

Now, if we assume that the birth order B-G-B-B-B-B is equally likely as any other birth order with six children, then we can estimate the number of families with this birth order as follows:

Number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B birth order = (1/64) \* Total number of families surveyed

= (1/64) \* 2,907

≈ 45.42

Since we can't have a fraction of a family, we'll round this number down to the nearest whole number, which is 45.

Therefore, our estimate is:

{answer: 45}
