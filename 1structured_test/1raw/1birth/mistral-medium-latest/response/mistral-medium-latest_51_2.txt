To answer this question, I would need more information about the total number of families surveyed and the distribution of birth orders. However, since this information is not provided, I can only make an estimate based on the assumption that the birth order of boys and girls is random.

Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely (with a probability of 0.5 each), the probability of the birth order G B G B B G can be calculated as follows:

P(G B G B B G) = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.015625

Similarly, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B can be calculated as:

P(B G B B B B) = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.015625

Since both birth orders have the same probability, we can assume that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also approximately 45 (assuming that the sample size is large enough for the probabilities to hold true).

Therefore, my estimate is:

answer: 45
