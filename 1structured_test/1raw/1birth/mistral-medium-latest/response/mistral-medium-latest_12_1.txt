To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be roughly equal in the absence of other information. However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate, as the actual probability could vary depending on many factors.

With that assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is 0.5 each. Therefore, the probability of having a particular sequence of six births (BBBBBG, for example) is:

(0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the birth sequence G-B-G-B-B-G, we can use this as a baseline to estimate the number of families with the birth sequence B-G-B-B-B-B.

First, let's find out the total number of possible birth sequences for six children:

2^6 = 64

This means that there are 64 possible sequences of births, including both BB BB BB BG and G BB BB BB.

Next, let's calculate the expected number of families with the birth sequence B-G-B-B-B-B, based on the probability calculated earlier and the total number of families surveyed:

Expected number of families = Total number of families \* Probability of B-G-B-B-B-B sequence

Assuming that the 45 families with the G-B-G-B-B-G sequence are a representative sample of all families surveyed, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing the number of families with the G-B-G-B-B-G sequence by the probability of that sequence:

Estimated total number of families = Number of families with G-B-G-B-B-G sequence / Probability of G-B-G-B-B-G sequence

Probability of G-B-G-B-B-G sequence = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Estimated total number of families = 45 / 0.015625 = 2,877.1 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Finally, we can estimate the number of families with the birth sequence B-G-B-B-B-B:

Expected number of families = Estimated total number of families \* Probability of B-G-B-B-B-B sequence

Expected number of families = 2,877.1 \* 0.015625 = 45 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B-G-B-B-B-B is:
