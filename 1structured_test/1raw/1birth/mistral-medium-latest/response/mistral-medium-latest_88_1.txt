Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

However, if we assume that the birth order of boys and girls is random and that each birth is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, then we can use probability theory to make an estimate.

Under this assumption, the probability of a family having the exact order of births G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64. Therefore, if there were 45 families with this birth order, we would expect there to be approximately 45 \* (1/64) / (1/32) = 27 families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

Therefore, my estimate is:
{answer: 27}
