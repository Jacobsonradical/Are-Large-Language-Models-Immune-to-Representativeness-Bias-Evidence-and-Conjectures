To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (0.5) for each birth. Under this assumption, the order of births in a family of six children follows a binomial distribution.

The number of families with the exact order G B G B B G is given as 45. Since there are 6!/(3!3!) = 20 possible orders with 3 boys and 3 girls, the probability of the order G B G B B G is:

P(G B G B B G) = Number of families with G B G B B G / Total number of families surveyed
P(G B G B B G) = 45 / (Total number of families surveyed \* 20/6!)

Solving for the total number of families surveyed, we get:

Total number of families surveyed = (45 \* 6!) / (20 \* P(G B G B B G))

However, we don't know the exact value of P(G B G B B G) yet. Since it's a binomial distribution with equal probabilities, the probability of any particular order with 3 boys and 3 girls is the same. Therefore, we can estimate P(G B G B B G) by assuming it's equal to 1/20 of the total probability of having 3 boys and 3 girls, which is (6! / (3!3!)) \* 0.5^3 \* 0.5^3 = 0.375.

Using this estimate, we can calculate the total number of families surveyed:

Total number of families surveyed = (45 \* 6!) / (20 \* 0.375) ≈ 216

Now, to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can use the same probability as before (since it's also a specific order with 3 boys and 3 girls):

Number of families with B G B B B B = Total number of families surveyed \* P(B G B B B B)
Number of families with B G B B B B = 216 \* (1/20) ≈ 10.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a family, we round this estimate to the nearest whole number:
