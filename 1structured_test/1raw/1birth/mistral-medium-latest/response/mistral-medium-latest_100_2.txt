To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% each. However, it's important to note that this may not be accurate in real-life situations.

Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equal, and the order of births is independent of previous births. Therefore, the probability of having a particular birth order is simply the product of the individual probabilities of each birth.

For the birth order G B G B B G, the probability is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, since there are six births and the probability of each birth being a boy or a girl is 1/2.

If there were 45 families with this birth order out of the total number of families surveyed, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Let N be the total number of families surveyed. Then, the expected number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is (1/64) \* N. Since there were 45 such families, we can write the equation:

(1/64) \* N = 45

Solving for N, we get:

N = 64 \* 45 = 2880

Now, we want to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. The probability of this birth order is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64. Therefore, the expected number of families with this birth order is:

(1/64) \* 2880 = 45

So our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is {answer: 45}.
