To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be 50% for each. However, it's essential to note that this assumption might not hold true for the specific population in the city.

With that said, let's proceed with the assumption of equal probabilities:

1. The probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is 0.5.
2. Since births are independent events, the probability of a particular birth order is the product of the probabilities of each individual birth in that order.
3. For the birth order G B G B B G, the probability would be (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.
4. In the survey, there were 45 families with this exact birth order, so we can estimate the probability of this birth order in the population by 45 / (total number of families surveyed).
5. Assuming that the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6, we can estimate the number of families with this birth order to be (total number of families surveyed) \* (0.5)^6.
6. However, we don't know the total number of families surveyed, only the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can proceed as follows:

1. Let N be the total number of families surveyed.
2. From the information given, we can write the equation: 45 = N \* (0.5)^6.
3. Solving for N, we get an estimate of the total number of families surveyed: N ≈ 16,384.
4. Now, to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we multiply the estimated total number of families by the probability of this birth order: N \* (0.5)^6 ≈ 16,384 \* 0.015625 ≈ 256.

Please note that this is an estimate based on the assumption of equal probabilities for boys and girls, and the actual number may vary depending on the specific population characteristics.

{answer: 256}
