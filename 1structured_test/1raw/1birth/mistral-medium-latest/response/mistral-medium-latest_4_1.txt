Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders, it's impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B. However, if we assume that the birth order of boys and girls is random and independent, then we can calculate the probability of a particular birth order occurring and use that to make an estimate.

The probability of a particular birth order occurring is 1/(2^6) = 1/64, since each child has a 1/2 chance of being a boy or a girl, and there are six children in the family. Therefore, if we assume that all birth orders are equally likely, then the expected number of families with a particular birth order is the total number of families surveyed times the probability of that birth order occurring.

Since we know that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, we can use that information to make an estimate of the total number of families surveyed. Specifically, we can assume that the number of families with each birth order is proportional to the number of ways that birth order can occur. There are 720 possible birth orders for six children, and there are 6!/(3!3!) = 20 possible arrangements of the birth order G B G B B G, so the probability of that birth order occurring is 20/720 = 1/36. Therefore, we can estimate that the total number of families surveyed is 45 \* 36 = 1620.

Using that estimate, we can then calculate the expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as:

1620 \* (1/64) = 25.3

Since we can't have a fraction of a family, we would round to the nearest whole number to get an estimate of 25 families with the birth order B G B B B B. Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
