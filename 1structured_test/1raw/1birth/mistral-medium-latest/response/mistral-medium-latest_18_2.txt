To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl. If we assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with an equal probability (0.5) for each gender, then we can estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B.

Since the number of families with the order G B G B B G is 45, we can use this as a baseline to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B. Both orders have six children, and they differ only in the arrangement of boys and girls.

Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability, the probability of the order G B G B B G is:

P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Similarly, the probability of the order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Since both orders have the same probability, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by multiplying the number of families with the order G B G B B G by the ratio of the number of permutations of the order B G B B B B to the number of permutations of the order G B G B B G.

The number of permutations of the order G B G B B G is 6! / (3! \* 2! \* 1!) = 60, since there are 3 girls and 2 boys in the order. Similarly, the number of permutations of the order B G B B B B is 6! / (5! \* 1!) = 6, since there is only 1 girl in the order.

Therefore, the ratio of the number of permutations of the order B G B B B B to the number of permutations of the order G B G B B G is 6/60 = 1/10.

So, our estimate of the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B is:

Estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B = (Number of families with the order G B G B B G) x (Ratio of the number of permutations of the order B G B B B B to the number of permutations of the order G B G B B G)
Estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B = 45 x (1/10) = 4.5

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round our estimate to the nearest whole number. Therefore, our estimate is:
