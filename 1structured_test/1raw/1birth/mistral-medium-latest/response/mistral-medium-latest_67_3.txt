To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (0.5) for each birth. However, it's important to note that this assumption may not hold true in real-life scenarios due to various biological and genetic factors.

Under this assumption, the probability of a particular birth order occurring is simply the product of the probabilities of each individual birth in that order. Since the probability of a boy or a girl being born is assumed to be 0.5, the probability of any specific birth order of six children is:

(0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Now, we know that in 45 families, the birth order was G B G B B G. Since there are 720 possible birth orders for six children (2^6), the probability of this specific birth order is:

45/720 ≈ 0.0625

Assuming that the probabilities of different birth orders are independent and identically distributed, we can estimate the number of families in which the birth order was B G B B B B by multiplying the total number of families surveyed by the probability of this birth order:

Estimated number of families = Total number of families \* Probability of B G B B B B birth order

To determine the total number of families surveyed, we can use the fact that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G. Since the probability of this birth order is 0.0625, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Total number of families ≈ 45 / 0.0625 ≈ 720

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

Estimated number of families = 720 \* 0.015625 ≈ 11.25

Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a family, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number. Therefore, our final estimate is:

answer: 11 families
