To answer this question, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is a random event with equal probability (0.5) for each gender. Under this assumption, the probability of a particular birth order is the product of the probabilities of each individual birth in that order.

For the birth order G B G B B G, the probability is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625. Since there were 45 families with this birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing the number of families with this birth order by the probability of this birth order:

Total families surveyed = Number of families with G B G B B G birth order / Probability of G B G B B G birth order
= 45 / 0.015625
≈ 2876.67

Now, we can use this estimate to find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. The probability of this birth order is also (0.5)^6 = 0.015625. Therefore, the estimated number of families with this birth order is:

Number of families with B G B B B B birth order = Total families surveyed \* Probability of B G B B B B birth order
≈ 2876.67 \* 0.015625
≈ 45

However, this estimate assumes that the birth order is completely random, which may not be the case in reality. There could be various factors that influence the birth order, such as genetics, family planning, and so on. Therefore, it's important to keep in mind that this estimate is based on a simplifying assumption and may not be accurate in practice.

answer: {answer: 45}
