To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions about the birth sequence patterns. Since the problem doesn't provide information on the overall distribution of birth sequences, I'll assume that each birth sequence with six children is equally likely.

There are 720 possible birth sequences for six children, as each child can be either a boy or a girl (2 possibilities), and this can happen 6 times in a row (2^6 = 720).

Since 45 families have the sequence G-B-G-B-B-G, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the sequence B-G-B-B-B-B.

First, let's find the total number of families surveyed:

Let X be the total number of families surveyed.
The probability of a family having the G-B-G-B-B-G sequence is:

P(G-B-G-B-B-G) = Number of families with G-B-G-B-B-G / X

We know that 45 families have this sequence, so:

P(G-B-G-B-B-G) = 45 / X

Since we assume that each sequence is equally likely, the probability of any particular sequence should be 1/720. Therefore:

1/720 = 45 / X

Solving for X, we get:

X = 45 \* 720 â‰ˆ 32,400 families

Now, if we assume that every birth sequence is equally likely, then the number of families with the B-G-B-B-B-B sequence should also be:

Number of families with B-G-B-B-B-B = P(B-G-B-B-B-B) \* X = (1/720) \* 32,400 = 45

So, our estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B-G-B-B-B-B is:
