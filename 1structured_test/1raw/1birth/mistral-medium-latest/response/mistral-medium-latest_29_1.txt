To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to assume that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely, and that each birth is independent of the others. Under these assumptions, the probability of any particular birth order is (1/2)^6, as there are six births and two possible outcomes (boy or girl) for each birth.

The number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is given as 45. Since the probability of this birth order is also (1/2)^6, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. If we let N be the total number of families, then we have:

(1/2)^6 \* N = 45

Solving for N, we get:

N = 45 \* (2^6) = 45 \* 64 = 2880

Now, to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the same probability calculation:

(1/2)^6 \* N = (1/2)^6 \* 2880 = 72

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 72.

answer: 72
