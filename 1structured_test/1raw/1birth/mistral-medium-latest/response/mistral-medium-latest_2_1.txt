To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of a child being born as a boy or a girl. Although the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal, it can vary slightly due to various factors. However, for simplicity, let's assume that the chances of having a boy or a girl are equal (50% each).

Under this assumption, the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is the same as having the birth order B G B B B B, since both sequences have the same number of boys and girls. Therefore, we would expect the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to be roughly the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, which is 45.

So, the estimated number of families surveyed with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

answer: 45
