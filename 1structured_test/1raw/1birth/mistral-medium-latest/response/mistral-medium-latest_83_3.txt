There is no direct way to estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B based on the information provided about families with the order G B G B B G. The two birth orders are not related in a way that would allow for a meaningful estimation. Without more information, such as the total number of families surveyed or the overall distribution of birth orders, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate.

However, if we assume that all possible birth orders are equally likely (which may not be true in real life), then we could estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by dividing the number of families with the order G B G B B G by the number of possible birth orders for six children and then multiplying by the number of possible orders with the sequence B G B B B B.

There are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders for six children. Since there is only one way to arrange the sequence B G B B B B, we would divide 45 by 64 and multiply by 1 to get an estimate of approximately 0.7 families. However, since it is not possible to have a fraction of a family, this estimate is not meaningful in practice.

Therefore, without more information, it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B.

answer: {answer: I cannot provide an accurate estimate without more information.}
