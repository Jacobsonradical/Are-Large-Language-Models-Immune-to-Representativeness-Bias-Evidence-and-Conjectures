To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the likelihood of having a boy or a girl, which is typically assumed to be roughly equal. However, without more information about the birth rates of boys and girls in this specific city, we cannot provide an accurate estimate.

Assuming an equal probability of having a boy or a girl, the probability of having a specific sequence of six births (such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B) can be calculated as (0.5)^6, since there are six independent events, each with a probability of 0.5.

Therefore, if there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we would expect a similar number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, assuming that the two sequences are equally likely.

However, it's important to note that this is only an estimate based on the assumption of equal probability, and the actual number of families with the birth order B G B B B B could be different.

Answer:
{answer: 45}
