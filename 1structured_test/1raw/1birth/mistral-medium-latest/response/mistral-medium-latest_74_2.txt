To answer this question, I would need more information about the total number of families surveyed and the distribution of birth orders in the general population. However, since this information is not provided, I can only make an estimate assuming that the distribution of birth orders is random.

Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely (50% chance), the probability of a particular birth order for six children can be calculated as:

(0.5)^6 = 0.015625

This means that there is a 1.5625% chance that a family of six children will have the exact birth order of B G B B B B.

If we further assume that the 45 families with the birth order of G B G B B G are representative of the general population, then we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Let N be the total number of families surveyed.
Then 45/N = (number of families with birth order G B G B B G) / (total number of families surveyed)

We can estimate N as:
N = 45 / (number of families with birth order G B G B B G / total number of possible birth orders)

Since there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders for six children, we can estimate N as:
N = 45 / (45 / 64) = 64

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families surveyed with the birth order of B G B B B B is:

(total number of families surveyed) x (probability of birth order B G B B B B)
= 64 x 0.015625
= approximately 1.0

However, since it is unlikely that only one family would have the exact birth order of B G B B B B, I would suggest that this estimate is not very accurate. Without more information, it is difficult to make a reliable estimate.
