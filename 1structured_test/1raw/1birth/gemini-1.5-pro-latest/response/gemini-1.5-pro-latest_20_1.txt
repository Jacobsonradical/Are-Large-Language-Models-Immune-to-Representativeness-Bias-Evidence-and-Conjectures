Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with the probability of specific birth orders in families with six children.  The assumption is that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).

**Why we can't give an exact answer:**

We can't definitively say how many families will have the birth order "B G B B B B" just because 45 families had a different specific order.  Here's why:

* **Randomness:** Birth order is largely random. Even if the odds are close to 50/50 for each child, getting a specific sequence is like flipping a coin six times and getting a specific sequence of heads and tails.
* **Limited Information:** Knowing one specific birth order frequency doesn't tell us anything about the frequency of other specific orders.

**Making a Reasonable Estimate**

Since we assume a 50/50 chance for each birth, any specific birth order within a family of six has the same probability.  There are two possible genders for each of the six births, making for a total of 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64 possible birth orders.

**Therefore, our best estimate is that the number of families with the birth order "B G B B B B" is roughly the same as the number with the order "G B G B B G".**

**{answer: 45}**
