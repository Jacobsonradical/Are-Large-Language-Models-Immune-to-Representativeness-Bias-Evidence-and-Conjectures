Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're assuming an equal chance of having a boy or girl for each birth.  The specific order G B G B B G is just one possible sequence out of many.  We want to estimate how many families might have a different specific sequence (B G B B B B).

**Logic**

* **Each birth is (roughly) independent:**  The gender of one child doesn't strongly influence the gender of the next.
* **Many possible sequences:** With 6 children, there are 2^6 = 64 possible boy/girl sequences.

**Estimate**

Since each sequence has a roughly equal chance, and we're looking for one specific sequence out of 64, we'd expect the number of families with the B G B B B B sequence to be similar to the number with the G B G B B G sequence.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
