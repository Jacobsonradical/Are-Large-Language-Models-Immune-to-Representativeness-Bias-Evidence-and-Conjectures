Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making estimations based on a sample. We're given information about a specific birth order pattern in a sample of families and asked to estimate how many families in the total survey might have a different pattern. 

**Key Assumption**

We need to assume that the order of births of boys and girls is completely random, meaning there's no biological factor making any particular order more likely.

**Logic**

* **Equal Probability:** If the order of births is truly random, any specific sequence of 6 children (BBGBGB, GGBBGB, etc.) has an equal probability of occurring.
* **Sample to Population:**  The 45 families with the G B G B B G pattern represent a portion of the total families surveyed.  We can use this proportion to estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern.

**However...**

We cannot calculate an exact answer. Here's why:

* **Small Sample Size:** 45 families are a relatively small sample size. It's unlikely that this perfectly reflects the true probabilities of every birth order in the entire city's population.
* **Lack of Total Families:**  We don't know how many total families were surveyed.  

**Making an Estimate**

Without more information, the best we can do is make a very rough estimate.  Since all birth orders are equally likely under the assumption of randomness, we might expect the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern to be *similar* to the number with the G B G B B G pattern. 

**Answer**

{answer: It is likely that a very small number of families surveyed had the birth order B G B B B B, potentially close to the 45 families that had the birth order G B G B B G. However, this is just a rough estimate, and the actual number could be higher or lower.}
