Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy and girl births.  We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of another.

**Assumptions**

We'll make a simplifying assumption:

* **Equal Probability:** We'll assume the probability of having a boy or girl is equal (approximately 50/50). In reality, this can vary slightly.

**Logic**

If the probability of having a boy or girl is equal, then any specific birth order of 6 children has the same probability. This is because each birth is considered an independent event.

Since G B G B B G and B G B B B B are just two specific orders out of many possibilities, their probabilities would be considered roughly equal.

**Estimate**

Given our assumptions, we'd estimate that roughly the same number of families would have the birth order B G B B B B as G B G B B G.

**Answer:**
