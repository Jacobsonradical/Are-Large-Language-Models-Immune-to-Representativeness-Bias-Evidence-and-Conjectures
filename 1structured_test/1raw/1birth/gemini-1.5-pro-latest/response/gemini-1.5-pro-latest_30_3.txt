Here's how to approach this problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Situation**

We're assuming an equal chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth.  The specific order G B G B B G is just one possible sequence out of many.

**Estimating the Probability**

* Each birth has 2 equally likely possibilities: boy (B) or girl (G).
* In a family of six children, there are 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64 possible birth order combinations.

**Applying the Probability**

Since each birth order sequence is equally likely (with our assumption), we can estimate that the sequence B G B B B B would occur at a similar rate to the sequence G B G B B G.

**The Estimate**

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is approximately the same as the number with the order G B G B B G.
