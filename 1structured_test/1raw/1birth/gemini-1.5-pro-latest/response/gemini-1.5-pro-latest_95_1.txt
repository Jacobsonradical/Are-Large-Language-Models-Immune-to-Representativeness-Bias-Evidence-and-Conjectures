Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Underlying Assumption**

This question relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (which is generally true in real life). If we assume this, we can think of each birth order as equally likely.

**Why?**

Imagine flipping a coin six times.  The sequence HTHTHT is just as likely as HHHHHH or any other specific sequence.

**Applying this to the problem:**

Since each specific birth order (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is equally likely, we wouldn't expect one order to be significantly more common than another. 

**Therefore:**

Our best estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

**Answer:**
