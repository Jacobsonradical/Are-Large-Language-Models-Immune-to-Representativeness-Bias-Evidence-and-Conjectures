Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy vs. girl births.  We're given data about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of a different birth order.

**Assumptions**

We'll assume the following:

* **Equal Probability:** The probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (approximately 50/50). 
* **Independence:**  The gender of one child's birth doesn't influence the gender of other births in the family.

**Logic**

If the probability of having a boy or girl is equal and independent, then any specific birth order of 6 children has the same probability. This is because each birth has two equally likely possibilities (B or G).

**Estimate**

Since every specific birth order has the same probability, we'd expect the birth order B G B B B B to occur roughly the same number of times as G B G B B G.

**Answer:**
