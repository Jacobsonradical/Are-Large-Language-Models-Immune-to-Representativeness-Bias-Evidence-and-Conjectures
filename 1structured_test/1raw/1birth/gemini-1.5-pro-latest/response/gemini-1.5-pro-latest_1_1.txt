It's impossible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based solely on the number of families with the order GBGBBG. Here's why:

* **Independent Events:** The sex of each child's birth is generally considered an independent event. This means the outcome of one birth doesn't influence the outcome of any other birth.
* **Equal Probability (Generally):** While not perfectly equal in reality, the probability of having a boy or a girl is close enough to 50/50 for this type of estimation.

**Why GBGBBG doesn't matter:**  Knowing that 45 families had a specific birth order doesn't change the probabilities for any other family.  Each family surveyed had an independent chance of having any specific birth order.

**To illustrate:** Imagine flipping a coin six times. Knowing that one person got the sequence Heads-Tails-Heads-Tails-Tails-Heads doesn't tell you anything about the probability of another person getting six heads in a row. 

**Conclusion:**  You would need more information, such as the total number of families surveyed, to even begin to make a statistically sound estimate. 

**{answer: Cannot estimate based on provided information}**
