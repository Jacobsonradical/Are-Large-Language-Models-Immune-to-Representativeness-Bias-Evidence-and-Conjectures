It's impossible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based solely on the information given. Here's why:

* **No Underlying Probability:** We don't know the general probability of having a boy versus a girl. Assuming a 50/50 chance is unrealistic due to slight variations in real-world birth rates.
* **Small Sample Size:** 45 families with one specific birth order don't represent the overall distribution of birth orders in a city.
* **Randomness:**  Birth order is largely random.  Finding a specific order once doesn't make another order more or less likely within the overall population.

**In short, there's no statistically sound way to extrapolate the number of BGBBBB families from the given data.** 

**{answer: Cannot estimate based on provided information}**
