Here's how to approach this problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're assuming the probability of having a boy or girl is roughly equal (about 50/50).  The specific order of births G B G B B G is just one particular sequence.  The sequence B G B B B B is equally likely to occur by pure chance.

**Estimating the Answer**

Since each specific birth order has an equal likelihood, if 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, we would expect *approximately* 45 families to have the sequence B G B B B B.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
