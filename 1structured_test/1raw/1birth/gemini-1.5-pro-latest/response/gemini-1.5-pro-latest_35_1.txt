Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This question relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (which is generally true in large populations). We're given information about one specific birth order pattern and asked to estimate the frequency of another.

**Reasoning**

* **Equal Probability:** If the chance of having a boy or girl is roughly 50/50, then any specific birth order sequence is equally likely. 
* **Many Possible Sequences:** There are many different possible sequences for 6 children (2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64 possible sequences).

**Estimate**

Since each sequence has a similar likelihood, and we know one sequence occurred 45 times, it's reasonable to estimate that other specific sequences would also occur around the same number of times.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
