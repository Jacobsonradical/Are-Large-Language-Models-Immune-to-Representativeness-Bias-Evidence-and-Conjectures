Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're assuming that the sex of each child's birth is independent of the others (like flipping a coin).  This means any specific birth order has an equal chance.

**Estimating the Probability**

* There are two possible outcomes for each birth: boy (B) or girl (G).
* With six children, there are 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64 possible birth orders.
* Since each order is equally likely, the probability of any specific order (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is 1/64.

**Estimating the Number of Families**

If 45 families had the order G B G B B G (a 1/64 probability), we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:

* Let 'x' be the total number of families surveyed.
* (1/64) * x ≈ 45 
* x ≈ 45 * 64
* x ≈ 2880

**Answer**

{answer: 2880} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate. In reality, the sex distribution of births might not be perfectly 50/50, and other factors could influence the observed birth orders.
