It's impossible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order "BGBBBB" based solely on the information given. Here's why:

* **Biological sex at birth isn't perfectly random:** While often simplified, the biological sex of a child isn't a perfect 50/50 coin flip. There are slight natural variations.
* **Family planning:** Many families plan the size of their families, and their preferences for the number of boys or girls could influence their decisions to have more children. 

**In short, knowing the frequency of one specific birth order doesn't give us enough information to predict the frequency of another.** 

**To illustrate:** It's tempting to think "If 45 families have this specific order, maybe a similar number have the other order". However, that assumes an equal likelihood of all birth orders, which isn't necessarily true.

**Therefore, there's no reliable way to provide an estimate.**
