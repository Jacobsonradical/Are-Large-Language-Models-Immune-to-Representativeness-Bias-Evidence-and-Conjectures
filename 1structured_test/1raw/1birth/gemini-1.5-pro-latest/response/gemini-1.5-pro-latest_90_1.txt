Here's how to approach this problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Underlying Assumption**

This problem relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (which is generally true in real-life demographics). 

**Logic**

If the births of boys and girls are equally likely, then any specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) has an equal chance of occurring. 

**Estimate**

Since every unique sequence has an equal chance, and we know 45 families had one specific sequence, it's reasonable to estimate that approximately 45 families also had the sequence B G B B B B.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
