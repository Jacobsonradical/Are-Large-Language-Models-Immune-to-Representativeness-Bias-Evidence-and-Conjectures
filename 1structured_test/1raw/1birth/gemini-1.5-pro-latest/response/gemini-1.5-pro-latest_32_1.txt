Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

The problem assumes that the order of births between boys and girls is completely random.  This means there's an equal chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth.

**Probability of a Specific Sequence**

* Each birth has 2 equally likely possibilities: boy (B) or girl (G).
* In a family of 6 children, there are 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64 possible birth order sequences.
* This means any specific birth order sequence (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) has a 1/64 chance of occurring.

**Estimating Total Families**

Since the probability of any specific sequence is 1/64, we'd expect roughly the same number of families for each sequence.  

* We know 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G.
* Since all sequences have an equal likelihood, we can estimate that approximately 45 families would also have the sequence B G B B B B.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
