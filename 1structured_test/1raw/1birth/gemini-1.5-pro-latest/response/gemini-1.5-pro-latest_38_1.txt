Here's how to approach this problem:

This question relies on the assumption that the order of births (boy or girl) is completely random and equally likely.  

**If we assume a 50/50 chance of having a boy or girl:**

* The probability of one specific sequence (like GBGBBG) is the same as the probability of any other specific sequence (like BGBBBB). 
*  Since every sequence of 6 children has an equal chance of occurring, in a large enough sample size, we'd expect to see roughly the same number of families with each sequence.

**Therefore:**

*  A reasonable estimate for the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB is approximately the same as the number of families with the order GBGBBG.

**Answer:** {answer: 45}
