Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Situation**

* **Equal Probability:** We're assuming the probability of having a boy or girl is roughly equal (which is generally true). 
* **Specific Sequence:**  We're looking at the chances of a very specific birth order occurring.

**Logic**

The sequence G B G B B G is just as likely to occur as the sequence B G B B B B. This is because each birth has a (roughly) independent 50/50 chance of being a boy or girl.

**Estimate**

Since the probabilities of the two sequences are equal, if 45 families have the first sequence, we would estimate that **approximately** 45 families would have the second sequence.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
