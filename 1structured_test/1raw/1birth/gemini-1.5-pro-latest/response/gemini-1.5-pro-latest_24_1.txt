Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy vs. girl births.  We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of another.

**Assumptions**

We need to make a key assumption to solve this:

* **Equal Probability:**  We'll assume the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (approximately 50/50). 

**Logic**

If the probability of having a boy or girl is equal, then any specific birth order of 6 children has the same probability.  This is because each birth is an independent event.

**Estimation**

Since every specific birth order (including all boys, all girls, or any other sequence) has the same probability, we can estimate that roughly the same number of families would have the birth order BGBBBB as GBGBBG.

**Answer**

{answer: 45} 

**Important Note:** This is a rough estimate. In reality, the sex ratio at birth is not exactly 1:1, and other factors can influence birth orders within families.
