Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem hinges on the assumption that the order of births of boys and girls is random and equally likely.  In reality, this might not be perfectly true, but for the sake of the problem, we'll assume it is.

**Logic**

* **Possible Orders:**  Each child has 2 possibilities (boy or girl). With 6 children, there are 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64 possible birth orders.
* **Equal Probability:** If each birth order is equally likely, then any specific order (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) has a 1/64 chance of occurring.

**Estimate**

Since the chance of any specific order is 1/64, we'd expect roughly 1/64 of the families surveyed to have each specific birth order.

If 45 families have the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:

*  (Total Families) * (1/64) ≈ 45 Families
*  Total Families ≈ 45 Families * 64 
*  Total Families ≈ 2880

**Answer**

{answer: 2880}
