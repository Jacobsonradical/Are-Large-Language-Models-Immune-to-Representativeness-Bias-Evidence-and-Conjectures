Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves the probability of specific birth orders.  It's tempting to assume the probability of a boy (B) or girl (G) is equal (50/50). However, we are given specific information about one birth order within the entire population.

**Logic and Assumptions**

We're assuming that the provided data is representative of the general population in the city.  This means that if one specific birth order is unusually common, we can assume other birth orders are likely *less* common.

**Estimation**

Since the order G B G B B G appeared 45 times, it suggests this order is more common than random chance might suggest.  Therefore, the order B G B B B B, being a different specific order, is likely to be *less* common.

**Answer**

It's impossible to give a precise number without more information. However, based on the logic above, a reasonable estimate would be a number significantly lower than 45.

**{answer: 15}** 

**Important Note:** This is an educated guess.  The actual number could be higher or lower.  A more accurate answer would require data on the frequency of other birth orders in the city.
