It's impossible to estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based solely on the information given. Here's why:

* **We don't know the overall boy/girl ratio in the city.**  The fact that 45 families had the order GBBGBG doesn't tell us if this order is common, rare, or if boys and girls are born in roughly equal numbers.
* **Birth orders aren't necessarily random.** While there's a strong element of chance, factors like cultural preferences can slightly influence the sex ratio of births in a population.

**To make an estimate, we would need additional information like:**

* The total number of families surveyed.
* The overall proportion of boys to girls born in the city.

**Without that information, any estimate for the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB would be purely speculative.**
