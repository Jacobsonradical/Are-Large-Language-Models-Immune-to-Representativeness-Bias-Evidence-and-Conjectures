Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making estimations based on limited information. We know that the order of births in a family is generally random.  The fact that 45 families had a specific order doesn't mean other orders are more or less likely.

**Estimating the Answer**

* **Equal Probability:**  We can assume that any specific birth order for 6 children is roughly equally as likely as another.  
* **Possible Orders:** There are a large number of possible birth orders for 6 children (2 possibilities for each birth - boy or girl, so 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64 total possibilities).

Since each order is roughly equally likely, we'd expect the number of families with the order "B G B B B B" to be similar to the number with the order "G B G B B G".

**Answer**
