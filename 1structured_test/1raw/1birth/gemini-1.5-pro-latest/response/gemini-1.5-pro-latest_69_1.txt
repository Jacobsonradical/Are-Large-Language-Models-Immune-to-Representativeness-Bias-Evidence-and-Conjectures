Here's how to approach this problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability, but we have limited information. We're assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl has an equal probability (50/50). 

**Logic**

The specific sequence G B G B B G is just one possible arrangement of births. Any other specific sequence (like B G B B B B) has the same probability of occurring in a single family.

**Estimate**

Since every specific birth order sequence has an equal chance, we can estimate that roughly the same number of families would have the B G B B B B sequence as the G B G B B G sequence.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
