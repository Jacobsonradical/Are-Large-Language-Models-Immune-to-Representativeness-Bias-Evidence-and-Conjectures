Here's how to approach this problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with the probability of specific birth orders in families with six children. The assumption is that having a boy or a girl is equally likely (50/50 chance).

**Why the Given Information Matters**

The fact that 45 families had the specific order G B G B B G seems important, but it's actually not very helpful for our estimate. Here's why:

* **Many Possible Orders:** There are a huge number of possible birth orders for six children (2 possibilities for each child, so 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64 total orders). 
* **One Specific Order:**  The given information focuses on just one of those 64 orders. 

**Making a Reasonable Estimate**

Since each birth order is essentially a random sequence of boys and girls, and we're assuming a 50/50 chance for each birth, any particular order of 6 children is going to be equally likely (or unlikely) to occur.

Therefore, the order B G B B B B is just as likely as the order G B G B B G.

**The Estimate**

{answer: 45} 

We would estimate that approximately 45 families have the birth order B G B B B B.
