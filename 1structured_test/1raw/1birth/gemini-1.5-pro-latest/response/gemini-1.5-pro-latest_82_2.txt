Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with the probability of specific birth orders in families with six children.  The assumption is that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).

**Estimating the Probability**

* Each birth has two equally likely possibilities: boy (B) or girl (G).
* In a sequence of six births, there are 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64 possible combinations.

This means that any specific order of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) has a probability of 1/64.

**Estimating the Number of Families**

Since the probability of any specific birth order is roughly the same, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be similar to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G. 

**Answer**

{answer: 45} 

**Important Note:** This is a rough estimate. In reality, the sex ratio at birth might not be perfectly 50/50, and other factors could influence birth order probabilities.
