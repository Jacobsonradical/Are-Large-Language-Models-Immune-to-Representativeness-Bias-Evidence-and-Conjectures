Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This question hinges on the assumption that the sex of one child's birth doesn't influence the sex of other children's births. Essentially, we're dealing with a series of independent events where the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (about 50/50 in reality).

**Logic**

* **Equal Chance:** If each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl, then any specific sequence of 6 births (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) has the same probability as any other specific sequence. 
* **Many Possibilities:**  There are many possible sequences for 6 children (2 possibilities for each birth, so 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64 total possible sequences).

**Estimate**

Since all sequences are roughly equally likely, and we know 45 families had one specific sequence, we can estimate that a similar number of families would have any other specific sequence.

**{answer: 45}**
