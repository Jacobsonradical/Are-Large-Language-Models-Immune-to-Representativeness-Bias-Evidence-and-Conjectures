Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This question relies on the assumption that the order of boy and girl births is random and equally likely.  We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of a different specific birth order.

**Logic**

If the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50), then any specific birth order of 6 children has the same probability.  

Since G B G B B G and B G B B B B both represent unique and equally likely sequences, we can assume they would appear with roughly the same frequency in a large enough sample size.

**Answer**

Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.
