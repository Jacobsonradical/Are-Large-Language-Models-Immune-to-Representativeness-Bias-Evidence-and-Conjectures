Here's how to approach this problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy and girl births.  We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of a different birth order.

**Assumptions**

We need to make a key assumption to solve this:

* **Equal probability of boys and girls:**  We'll assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (approximately 50/50). In reality, this can vary slightly, but it's a reasonable assumption for an estimate.

**Logic**

If the probability of having a boy or girl is roughly equal, then any specific birth order of 6 children has the same probability.  

Think of it like flipping a coin 6 times â€“ the sequence HTHTHT is just as likely as HHHHHH or any other specific sequence.

**Estimate**

Since every specific birth order (including G B G B B G and B G B B B B) has the same probability, we'd expect them to occur with roughly the same frequency in a large enough sample.

**Therefore, our estimate is that approximately 45 families surveyed had the birth order B G B B B B.**

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
