It's impossible to give a statistically sound estimate without more information. Here's why:

* **Biological factors vs. randomness:**  While we often assume an equal chance of having a boy or girl, slight biological factors might favor one over the other in a given population. 
* **Small sample size:** 45 families is a very small sample size to draw conclusions about the entire city. 
* **Unique patterns:** The specific sequence GBGBBG doesn't give us any information about the likelihood of another specific sequence like BGBBBB.

**To make a reasonable estimate, we'd need:**

* **Larger sample size:** A much larger sample of families.
* **Assumptions:** We'd have to assume the chance of having a boy or girl is approximately equal and independent of previous births. 

**Without further information, any estimate would be purely speculative.**

**{answer: Cannot estimate based on the given information}**
