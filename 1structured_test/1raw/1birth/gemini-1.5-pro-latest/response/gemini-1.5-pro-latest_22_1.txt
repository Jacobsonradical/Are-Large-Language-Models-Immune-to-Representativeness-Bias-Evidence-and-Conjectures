Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This question relies on the assumption that the sex of one child's birth doesn't influence the sex of other children's births. Basically, we're dealing with something similar to coin flips â€“ each birth has about a 50/50 chance of being a boy or a girl.

**Logic:**

* The specific order G B G B B G occurred in 45 families.
*  Since the probability of a boy or girl is roughly equal, any other specific order of 3 boys and 3 girls is statistically just as likely. 

**Estimate:**

It's reasonable to estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be **similar** to the number with the order G B G B B G.  

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate is around 45 families.**

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
