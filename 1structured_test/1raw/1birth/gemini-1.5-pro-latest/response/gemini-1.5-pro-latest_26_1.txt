Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability, but we have limited information. We're assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50).  

**Logic**

* **Equal Chance:** With a 50/50 chance of each gender, any specific birth order of 6 children is equally likely.
* **Finding the Estimate:**  Since one specific order (GBGBBG) appeared 45 times, we can reasonably estimate that any other specific order, like BGBBBB, would appear a similar number of times.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
