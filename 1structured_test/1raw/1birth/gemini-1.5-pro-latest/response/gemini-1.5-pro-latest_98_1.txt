Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy and girl births. We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of another.

**Assumptions**

To solve this, we'll assume:

* **Equal Chance:** The probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).
* **Independence:** The gender of one child does not influence the gender of the next child.

**Logic**

If we assume an equal chance of boy/girl for each birth, then *every single specific birth order* of six children has the exact same probability. This is because each birth has two equally likely outcomes (B or G).

**Estimate**

Since every specific birth order has the same probability, we'd expect the birth order B G B B B B to occur roughly the **same number of times** as G B G B B G. 

**Answer**

{answer: 45} 

**Important Note:**  This is a simplified estimate. In reality, slight variations in boy/girl birth ratios exist, and the independence of births might not be perfectly accurate.
