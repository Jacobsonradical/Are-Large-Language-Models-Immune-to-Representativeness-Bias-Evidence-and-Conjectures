Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

This problem assumes that the sex of one child's birth does not influence the sex of other children's births. Essentially, we're dealing with a series of coin flips – each birth has approximately a 50/50 chance of being a boy or a girl.

**Estimating the Probability**

* Each specific birth order (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) has an equal probability.  Think of it like flipping a coin six times – each specific sequence of heads and tails is equally likely.

**The Estimate**

Since every specific birth order is equally likely, we'd expect the order B G B B B B to occur roughly the same number of times as G B G B B G in a large enough sample size.

**Therefore:**
