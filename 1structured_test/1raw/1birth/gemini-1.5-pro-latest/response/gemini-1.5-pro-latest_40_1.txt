Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Assumption**

This question relies on a key assumption: the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).  We also assume births are independent events, meaning one birth doesn't influence the next.

**Logic**

* **Equal Probability:** If the chance of having a boy or girl is equal, then any specific order of 6 children is equally likely. 
* **Irrelevant Information:**  The fact that 45 families had the order G B G B B G is actually irrelevant to the question. It doesn't change the probability of another specific order occurring.

**Estimate**

Since every specific sequence of 6 births has the same probability, we'd expect the order B G B B B B to occur roughly the same number of times as G B G B B G in a large enough sample.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
