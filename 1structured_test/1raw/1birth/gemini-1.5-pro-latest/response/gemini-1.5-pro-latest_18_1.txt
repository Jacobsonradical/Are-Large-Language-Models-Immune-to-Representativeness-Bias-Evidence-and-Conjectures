Here's how to approach this problem and provide a reasonable estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with the probability of specific birth orders in families with six children. The prompt gives us data on one specific order (GBGBBG) and asks us to estimate the frequency of a different specific order (BGBBBB).

**Key Assumption**

We'll assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl at each birth is approximately equal (50% chance each).  This is a simplification, as real-world factors can slightly skew birth probabilities.

**Logic**

If we assume a 50/50 chance for each birth, every unique birth order within a six-child family has the same probability. This is because each birth is an independent event.

**Estimation**

* Since each unique birth order has the same likelihood, and we know 45 families fit one specific order (GBGBBG), it's reasonable to estimate that roughly the same number of families would fit the order BGBBBB. 

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
