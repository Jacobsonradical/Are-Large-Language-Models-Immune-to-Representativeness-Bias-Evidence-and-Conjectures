It's impossible to give a reliable estimate based on this information. Here's why:

* **Order matters:** The prompt focuses on the *exact* sequence of genders.  This implies we're dealing with permutations, where order is crucial.
* **No underlying probability:** We have no information about the general probability of having a boy or girl. We can't assume it's a 50/50 chance.  Factors like cultural preferences can influence gender ratios in a population.

**To illustrate:**

Imagine for a moment that there was a strong cultural preference for boys in this city.  It's plausible that many families would keep having children until they had multiple boys, making a sequence like "BGBBBB" far more common than "GBGBBG".

**Therefore:**

{answer: Cannot estimate}
