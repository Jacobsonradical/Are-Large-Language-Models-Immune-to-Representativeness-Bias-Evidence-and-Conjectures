Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

This problem involves probability, specifically the probability of a specific sequence of events (boy or girl births). We're assuming the probability of having a boy or girl is roughly equal (50/50). 

**Important Note:**  We cannot determine the exact number of families with the birth order "BGBBBB" from the given information. We can only estimate.

**Logic for Estimation**

* **Equal Probability:** If the chance of having a boy or girl is roughly equal, any specific birth order of 6 children has a low probability.
* **Similar Rarity:**  The order "GBGBBG" and "BGBBBB" are both specific sequences with an equal number of boys and girls. This means they are equally likely to occur by random chance.

**Estimation**

Since the probability of any specific birth order is low and the two orders we're comparing are equally likely, it's reasonable to estimate that the number of families with the birth order "BGBBBB" is similar to the number with "GBGBBG".
