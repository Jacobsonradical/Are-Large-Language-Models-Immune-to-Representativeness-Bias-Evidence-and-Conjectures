Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're assuming the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50). The specific order G B G B B G is just one possible sequence out of many.  The key is realizing that any specific sequence of 6 births has the same probability as any other specific sequence.

**Solution**

Since every unique birth order sequence has an equal chance of occurring, the sequence B G B B B B would be just as likely as the sequence G B G B B G. 

**Therefore, our best estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G.**

**Answer:**
