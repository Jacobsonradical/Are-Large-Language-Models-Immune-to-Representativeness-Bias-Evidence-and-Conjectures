Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability, but we have very limited information.  We're assuming that the birth of a boy or girl has an equal (50/50) chance.

**Reasoning**

* **Equal Likelihood:**  If we assume an equal chance of having a boy or girl, any specific birth order sequence is equally likely.  Think about flipping a coin six times â€“ getting any specific sequence of heads and tails has the same probability.
* **Irrelevant Information:** The fact that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G is actually irrelevant to finding the probability of another specific sequence. Each family's birth order is independent of others.

**Solution**

Since every possible sequence of six children has the same probability, and we're looking for an estimate for *one specific* sequence (B G B B B B), our best estimate is simply:

**{answer: 45}** 

**Important Note:** This is a statistical estimate. In reality, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B might be slightly higher or lower than 45 due to random chance.
