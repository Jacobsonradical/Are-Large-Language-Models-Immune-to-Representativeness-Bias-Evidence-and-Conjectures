Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability, but we're dealing with a real-world scenario where we're making an estimate based on a sample.  The key assumption is that the order of births (boy or girl) is essentially random.

**Logic**

* **Equal Chance:** We're assuming an equal chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth.  
* **Specific Sequence:** The probability of any specific birth order sequence (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is the same. This is like flipping a coin six times and getting a specific sequence of heads and tails.

**Estimation**

Since each specific birth order sequence has an equal probability, we'd expect to find roughly the same number of families with the sequence B G B B B B as we found with G B G B B G.
