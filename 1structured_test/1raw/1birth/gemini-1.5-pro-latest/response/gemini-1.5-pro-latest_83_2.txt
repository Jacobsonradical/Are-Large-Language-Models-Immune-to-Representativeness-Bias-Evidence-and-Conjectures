Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy and girl births. We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of a different birth order.

**Assumptions**

We'll assume:

* **Equal Chance:** There's an approximately equal chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth. 
* **Independence:**  The sex of one child doesn't influence the sex of the other children in the family.

**Logic**

If we assume an equal chance of having a boy or girl, any specific birth order of 6 children has the same probability.  This is because each birth has two equally likely possibilities (B or G), and we have 6 births in a row (2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64 possible combinations).

**Estimate**

Since every specific birth order (including G B G B B G and B G B B B B) has the same probability, we'd expect them to occur with roughly the same frequency in a large enough sample.

**Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.**

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
