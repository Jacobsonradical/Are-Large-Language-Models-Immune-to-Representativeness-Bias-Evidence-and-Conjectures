Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making estimations based on a sample.  We're assuming that the birth of a boy or girl has an equal, independent probability (about 50/50).

**Logic**

* **Equal Chance:**  Every specific birth order of 6 children has an equal probability. This is because the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly the same for each birth.
* **Sample Size:**  The fact that 45 families had the order G B G B B G doesn't change the probability of other orders occurring.

**Estimation**

Since every sequence of 6 births is equally likely, we'd expect the sequence B G B B B B to occur with roughly the same frequency as G B G B B G within the total population.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
