Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Underlying Assumption**

This question relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).  In reality, there can be slight variations, but for this kind of estimation, we assume an equal chance.

**Logic**

If the chance of having a boy or girl is equal, then any specific birth order is equally likely.  This means:

* The sequence G B G B B G is just as likely as B G B B B B.
* In fact, any other specific sequence (like G G G B B B or B B G G B G) is also equally likely.

**Estimation**

Since each specific birth order sequence has an equal chance, we'd expect to find roughly the same number of families with the B G B B B B order as we did with the G B G B B G order.
