Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Assumption**

This problem relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).  While real-world factors can slightly skew this, we'll use this assumption for the estimation.

**Logic**

* **All sequences are equally likely:** If we list out all the possible birth order combinations for 6 children (BBGBBG, GGBBGB, etc.), each specific sequence has an equal chance of occurring.
* **Finding the probability:** The probability of one specific sequence (like GBBGBG or BGBBBB) is calculated as (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.  This is because there's a 1/2 chance for each birth to be the specific gender needed in the sequence.

**Estimation**

Since each specific birth order sequence has a 1/64 chance, and we know 45 families had the sequence GBBGBG, we can estimate:

* **Approximate total families:** There are 64 possible sequences, and we've observed the equivalent of one full sequence (GBBGBG) with 45 families.  Therefore, we can estimate that there were roughly 64 * 45 families surveyed.
* **Families with BGBBBB:** Since each sequence has an equal probability, we'd expect approximately 45 families to have the BGBBBB sequence.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
