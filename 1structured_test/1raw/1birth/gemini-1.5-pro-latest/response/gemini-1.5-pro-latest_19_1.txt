Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Situation**

The problem assumes that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50).  We know this isn't perfectly accurate in real life, but it's a reasonable assumption for this kind of estimation.

**Logic**

* **Equal Likelihood:** If the order of births is truly random, any specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) has the same probability as any other specific sequence. 
* **Estimating from a Sample:**  The fact that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G gives us information about the likely size of the total group surveyed.

**Estimation**

Since each specific sequence of boys and girls has an equal chance of occurring, we'd expect roughly the same number of families to have each possible sequence. 

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.**

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
