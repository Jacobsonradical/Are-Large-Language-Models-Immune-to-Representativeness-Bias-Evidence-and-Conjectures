Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem hinges on the assumption that the sex of each child in a family is like a coin flip â€“ a 50/50 chance of being a boy or a girl.  We're given data on one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of another.

**Logic**

If the probability of having a boy or a girl is truly random and independent for each child:

* The specific order G B G B B G should be roughly as common as B G B B B B.  
* Any other specific order (like B B G G B G) should also be roughly as common.

**Estimation**

Since we're assuming each specific birth order has a similar likelihood, our best estimate is that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is approximately equal to the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

**Answer:**
