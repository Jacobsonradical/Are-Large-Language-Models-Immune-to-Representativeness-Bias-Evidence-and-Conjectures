Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Assumption**

This problem relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50).  In reality, there can be slight variations, but for this estimation, we'll assume an equal chance.

**The Logic**

* **All sequences are equally likely:**  With a 50/50 chance for each birth, any specific sequence of 6 children (BBBBBB, GGGGGG, BGBGBG, etc.) has an equal probability of occurring. 
* **Estimating from one sequence:** Since we assume all sequences are equally likely, finding 45 families with the sequence GBBGBG suggests there would be approximately 45 families with any other specific sequence.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
