Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Situation**

* **Equal Probability:**  We assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (close to 50/50).
* **Order Matters:** We're looking for a very specific birth order in both cases.

**Reasoning**

Since the probability of having a boy or a girl is approximately equal, any specific birth order of 6 children is equally likely.  This means that the sequence G B G B B G is just as likely as B G B B B B, or any other specific sequence.

**Estimate**

Because all birth orders are equally likely, we'd expect the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to be roughly the same as those with the order G B G B B G.

**Answer**
