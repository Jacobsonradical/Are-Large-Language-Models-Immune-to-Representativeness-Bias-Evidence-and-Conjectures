Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy and girl births.  We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of a different birth order.

**Key Assumption**

We'll assume the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50). In reality, there can be slight variations, but this assumption gives us a good starting point.

**Reasoning**

* **Each birth is independent:**  The gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next child. 
* **Specific orders are equally likely:**  Under our assumption, any specific order of 6 births (like GBBGBG or BGBBBB) has the same probability as any other specific order.

**Estimate**

Since every specific birth order is equally likely, we'd expect the order BGBBBB to occur about as often as the order GBBGBG.
