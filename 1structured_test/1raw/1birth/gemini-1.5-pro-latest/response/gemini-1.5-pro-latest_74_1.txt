Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Underlying Assumption**

This question hinges on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50). In reality, there can be slight variations, but for this estimation, we'll assume an equal chance.

**Logic**

* If the order of births was completely random, any specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) would have an equal probability. 
* Since we're assuming each sequence is equally likely, finding a different specific sequence should result in a similar number of families.

**Estimate**

Therefore, it's reasonable to estimate that approximately the same number of families would have the birth order B G B B B B.
