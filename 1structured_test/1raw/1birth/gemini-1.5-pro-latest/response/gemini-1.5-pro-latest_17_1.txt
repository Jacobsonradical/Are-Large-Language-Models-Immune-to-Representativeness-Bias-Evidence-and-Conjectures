Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

This problem involves probability and making estimations based on limited information. We're assuming that the sex of each child born is independent of the previous births (like flipping a coin). In reality, there can be slight variations.

**Logic**

* **Equal Chance:**  For any given birth, there's approximately an equal chance of having a boy (B) or a girl (G). 
* **Specific Sequence:** The sequence "GBGBBG" is just as likely as " BGBBBB" or any other specific order of boys and girls.

**Estimation**

Since each specific sequence of 6 children has an equal chance of occurring, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order "BGBBBB" would be roughly the **same** as the number of families with the birth order "GBGBBG".

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
