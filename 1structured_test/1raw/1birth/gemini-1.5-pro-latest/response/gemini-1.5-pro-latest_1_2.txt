Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're assuming an equal chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth. The specific order G B G B B G occurring 45 times is given to help us estimate the total number of families. 

**Logic**

* **Many Possible Orders:**  There are many possible sequences of boys and girls in a family of six children (2 possibilities for each child, so 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64 total possible sequences).
* **Roughly Equal Distribution:**  If the probability of having a boy or girl is equal, we'd expect each of these 64 sequences to be roughly equally represented among the families.

**Estimation**

Since we expect each sequence to be roughly equally likely, and we know one sequence (G B G B B G) occurred 45 times, we can estimate that other sequences, like B G B B B B, also occurred around 45 times.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
