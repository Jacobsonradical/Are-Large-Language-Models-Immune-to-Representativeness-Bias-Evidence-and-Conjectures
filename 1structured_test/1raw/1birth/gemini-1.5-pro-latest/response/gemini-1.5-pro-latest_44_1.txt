Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

We're assuming that the sex of each child is independent of the others (like flipping a coin).  In reality, there can be slight variations in birth probabilities, but we'll ignore that for this estimate.

**Probability of a Specific Sequence**

The probability of one specific sequence of births (like G B G B B G) is the same as any other specific sequence (like B G B B B B).  This is because each birth has roughly a 1/2 chance of being a boy or girl.

**The Estimate**

Since each sequence of six births is equally likely, we'd expect the same number of families to have each sequence.  

**Therefore:**
