Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're assuming the probability of having a boy or girl is roughly equal (50/50).  The question is asking us to estimate how many families would have a very specific birth order (all boys except one girl in the second position) based on the observed number of families with a different specific birth order.

**Logic and Estimation**

* **Randomness:** If the order of births is truly random, any specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) has an equal chance of occurring.
* **Small Sample Size:** 45 families is a relatively small sample size.  We wouldn't expect the exact numbers of every birth order to be perfectly equal in such a small sample.

**Estimate**

Since each specific birth order has an equal likelihood in a random distribution, we'd expect the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to be **roughly similar** to the number of families with the order G B G B B G. 

**Therefore, a reasonable estimate is that around 45 families were surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.**

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
