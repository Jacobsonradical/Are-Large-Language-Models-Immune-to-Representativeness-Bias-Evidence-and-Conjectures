Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability, but we have to be careful. We're *not* dealing with the probability of a single family having a specific order of children.  Instead, we're looking at a real-world scenario where we're using a sample (the 45 families) to make an estimate about a larger population.

**Assumptions and Logic**

We have to assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (which is generally true for large populations).  If one birth order was significantly more likely, we'd expect to see that reflected in the survey.

Since any specific order of 6 children has an equal probability, we can assume that the order G B G B B G is about as likely as the order B G B B B B. 

**Estimate**

Because we're assuming the orders are equally likely, our best estimate is that roughly the same number of families would have the birth order B G B B B B as G B G B B G.
