Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Assumption**

This problem relies on a key assumption: the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50). In reality, there can be slight variations, but for this estimation, we'll assume an equal chance.

**The Logic**

If the chances of having a boy or girl are equal, then *any* specific order of 6 children is equally likely.  Whether it's G B G B B G,  B G B B B B, G G G G G G, or any other combination, the probability is the same.

**The Estimate**

Since each specific order of births has the same probability, and we know 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately **45** families also had the order B G B B B B. 

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
