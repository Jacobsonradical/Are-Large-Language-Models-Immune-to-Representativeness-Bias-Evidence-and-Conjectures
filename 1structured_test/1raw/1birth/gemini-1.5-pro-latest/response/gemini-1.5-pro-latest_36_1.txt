Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Assumption**

This problem relies on a key assumption: the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).  In reality, this can vary slightly, but for the sake of estimation, we'll use this assumption.

**The Logic**

* **Each birth is independent:**  The sex of one child doesn't influence the sex of the next child.
* **All orders are equally likely:** If we're assuming a 50/50 chance for each birth, then every specific order of 6 children (BBGBGG, GGBBGB, etc.) has the same probability.

**The Estimate**

Since every sequence of boys and girls is equally likely, we'd expect to see the sequence "BGBBBB" roughly the same number of times as we see "GBGBBG".

**{answer: 45}** 
 
It's important to note this is an estimate. Due to random chance, the actual number of families with the birth order "BGBBBB" could be slightly higher or lower than 45.
