Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and assumptions about the sex of children being roughly equal. We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of a different, but similar, birth order.

**Assumptions**

We need to assume:

* **Equal chance of boy or girl:** The probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).
* **Independence:** The sex of one child doesn't influence the sex of the next child.

**Logic**

If the chance of having a boy or girl is equal and independent for each birth, then *any* specific birth order of 6 children should have the same probability.  Since G B G B B G and B G B B B B are both specific orderings with the same number of boys and girls, they should occur with roughly the same frequency.

**Estimate**

Therefore, our best estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is approximately the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G.
