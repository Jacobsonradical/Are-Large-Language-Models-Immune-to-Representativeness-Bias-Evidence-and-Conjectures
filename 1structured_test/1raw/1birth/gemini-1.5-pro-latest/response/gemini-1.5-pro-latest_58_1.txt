Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with the probability of specific birth orders in families with six children.  The assumption is that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50%). 

**Why we can't determine an exact answer:**

We cannot definitively say how many families will have the birth order BBBBBB based on the information given.  Here's why:

* **Independent Events:** Each birth is an independent event. The gender of a previous child does not influence the gender of the next child.
* **Small Sample Size:** 45 families is a relatively small sample size.  In a larger sample, we might see different birth order frequencies.

**Making an Estimate**

Since the probability of each birth order is independent and based on roughly a 50/50 chance, we can make the following assumption:

* **Any specific birth order is equally likely.**  This means GBBGBG is just as likely as BBBBBB, BGBGBG, GGGGG, etc.

**Therefore, our best estimate is that a similar number of families will have the birth order BBBBBB as GBBGBG.**

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
