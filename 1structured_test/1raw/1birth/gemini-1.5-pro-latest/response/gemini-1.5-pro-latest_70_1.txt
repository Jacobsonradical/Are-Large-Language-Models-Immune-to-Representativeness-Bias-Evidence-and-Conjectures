Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves the probability of specific birth orders. We're assuming the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).  

**Logic**

* **Each birth is independent:** The gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next.
* **Specific order probability:** The probability of any specific birth order (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is the same.  Since the probability of having a boy or girl is roughly equal, each specific sequence of 6 births has the same probability.

**Estimate**

Since every specific sequence of 6 births is equally likely, we'd expect the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to be roughly the same as the number with the order G B G B B G.
