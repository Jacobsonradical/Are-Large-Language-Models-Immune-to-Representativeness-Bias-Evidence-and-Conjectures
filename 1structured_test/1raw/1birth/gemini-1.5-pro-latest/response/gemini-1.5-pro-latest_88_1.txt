Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy vs. girl births. We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of another.

**Assumptions**

* **Roughly Equal Probability:**  We'll assume a roughly equal chance of a child being born a boy or a girl (approximately 50/50).
* **Independence:** We'll assume that the sex of one child's birth doesn't influence the sex of other births in the family.

**Logic**

If the probability of having a boy or girl is roughly equal, then any specific birth order of 6 children has the same probability. This is because each birth has two equally likely possibilities (B or G).

**Estimate**

Since every specific birth order has the same probability, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB is roughly the **same** as the number of families with the birth order GBGBBG.
