Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy vs. girl births.  We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of a different birth order.

**Assumptions**

We'll make a simplifying assumption:

* **Equal probability:** We'll assume there's an equal chance of a child being born a boy or a girl (50/50). In reality, this isn't perfectly accurate, but it's close enough for an estimate.

**Logic**

If the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, then every single specific birth order of 6 children has the same probability.  

Think about it with coin flips.  Getting Heads-Tails-Heads-Tails-Tails-Heads is just as likely (or unlikely) as getting Heads-Heads-Heads-Tails-Tails-Tails.

**Estimate**

Since every birth order is equally likely under our assumption, we'd expect the birth order B G B B B B to occur roughly the same number of times as G B G B B G.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
