It's impossible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based solely on the number of families with the birth order GBGBBG. Here's why:

* **Independent Events:**  The sex of each child in a family is generally considered an independent event. This means the outcome of one birth (boy or girl) doesn't influence the outcome of the next birth.
* **Equal Probability (Generally):** While there can be slight variations, the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal for each birth. 

**Why this matters:** Knowing that 45 families had a specific birth order doesn't tell us anything about the likelihood of other specific birth orders. There's no logical connection between the two.

**To get an estimate, you would need additional information, such as:**

* The total number of families surveyed.
* The overall ratio of boys to girls born in the city. 

**Without this additional information, any estimate would be a pure guess.**

**{answer: Cannot estimate based on the given information.}**
