Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This question relies on the assumption that the sex of one child's birth doesn't influence the sex of other children's births.  Essentially, we're dealing with probabilities similar to flipping a coin.

**Reasoning**

* **Equal Probability:**  If we assume an equal chance of having a boy (B) or girl (G) for each birth, then any specific sequence of 6 births has the same probability. 
* **Many Possible Sequences:** There are many different possible sequences of boys and girls in a family of six children (2 possibilities for each birth, so 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64 total possible sequences).

**Estimation**

Since each sequence has an equal probability, and we know one specific sequence (GBGBBG) occurred 45 times, we can estimate that other specific sequences, like BGBBBB, would occur a similar number of times.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45} 

**Important Note:** This is a rough estimate. In reality, the sex ratio at birth isn't exactly 50/50, and there can be slight variations. However, without more information, assuming equal probability for each sequence is a reasonable approach for an estimation.
