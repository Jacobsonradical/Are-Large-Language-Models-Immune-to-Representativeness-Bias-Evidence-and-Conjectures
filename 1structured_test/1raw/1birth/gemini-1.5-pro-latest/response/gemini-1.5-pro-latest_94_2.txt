Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Underlying Assumption**

This question assumes that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).  While in reality, there can be slight variations, we operate on this assumption for simplicity.

**Logic**

* **Possible Sequences:**  For any family with 6 children, there are numerous possible birth order sequences (BBBGGG, GBGBGB, etc.). 
* **Equal Probability (theoretically):**  Because each birth has a roughly equal chance of being a boy or girl, each unique birth order sequence has an equal theoretical probability.

**Estimation**

If one specific birth order (GBGBBG) appeared 45 times in the survey, it suggests that other specific birth orders (like BGBBBB) would have a similar likelihood of appearing.

**Answer**

Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB is:

{answer: 45}
