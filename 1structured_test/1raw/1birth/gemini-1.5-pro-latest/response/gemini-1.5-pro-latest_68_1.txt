Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This question deals with the probability of specific birth orders in families with six children.  The assumption is that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).

**Why We Can't Know the Exact Number**

We can't determine the *exact* number of families with the birth order BBBBBB just from knowing how many had the order GBGBBG. Here's why:

* **Variations in Probability:**  While we assume a 50/50 chance for each birth, real-world factors can slightly skew these probabilities.
* **Small Sample Size:** 45 families are a relatively small sample size.  The more families surveyed, the more reliable our estimate would be.

**Making a Reasonable Estimate**

Given the assumption of roughly equal probability for boys and girls:

* Any specific birth order is equally likely.  GBGBBG is just as likely (or unlikely) as BBBBBB, GGGGGG, or any other specific sequence.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate is that roughly the same number of families would have the birth order BBBBBB as GBGBBG.
