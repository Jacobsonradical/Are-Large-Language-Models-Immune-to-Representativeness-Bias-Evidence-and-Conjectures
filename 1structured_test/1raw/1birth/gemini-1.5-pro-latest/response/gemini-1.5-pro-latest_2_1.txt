Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

The prompt highlights a specific, uncommon birth order. It's unlikely that there's a significant difference in probability between any two specific birth orders in a family of six.

**Estimating the Answer**

Since we're assuming the probability of any specific birth order is roughly equal, we'd expect a similar number of families to have the birth order BGBBBB as GGBBBG.

**Answer**

Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB is:

{answer: 45}
