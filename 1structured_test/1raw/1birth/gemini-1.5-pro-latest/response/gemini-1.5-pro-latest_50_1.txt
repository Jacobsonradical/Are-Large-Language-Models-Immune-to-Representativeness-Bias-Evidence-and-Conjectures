Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with the probability of specific birth order sequences in families with six children.  The key assumption is that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).

**Estimating the Probability**

* **Each Birth is Independent:** We assume each birth is an independent event. The gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next.
* **Equal Probability:**  With a 50/50 chance for each birth, the probability of any specific sequence (like BBBBBB, BGBGBG, etc.) is the same.

**Calculating the Estimate**

Since every unique sequence of boys and girls has an equal probability, finding the estimate for B G B B B B is the same as finding it for the given sequence G B G B B G. 

**Therefore, our estimate is that 45 families likely had the birth order B G B B B B.**

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
