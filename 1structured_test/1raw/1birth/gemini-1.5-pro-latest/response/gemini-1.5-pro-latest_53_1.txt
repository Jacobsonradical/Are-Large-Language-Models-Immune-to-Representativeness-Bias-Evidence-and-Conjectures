Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions. We're assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).  

**Logic**

The specific order G B G B B G is just one possible sequence out of many.  Since each birth has two equally likely outcomes (boy or girl), the probability of any specific sequence in 6 births is:

(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64

This means that we'd theoretically expect the sequence G B G B B G to occur about 1 out of every 64 families with six children.

**Estimation**

We observed this specific sequence (G B G B B G) in 45 families. If this sample is representative of the whole city, we can assume that a roughly similar number of families would have the sequence B G B B B B.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
