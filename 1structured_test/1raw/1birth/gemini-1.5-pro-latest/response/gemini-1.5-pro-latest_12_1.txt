It's impossible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order BBBBBB based solely on the number of families with the order GBGBBG. Here's why:

* **Independent Events:**  The sex of each child in a family is generally considered an independent event.  This means the outcome of one birth (boy or girl) doesn't influence the outcome of any other birth in the family.
* **Small Sample Size:**  Knowing the birth order frequency for one specific sequence in a limited sample doesn't give us enough information to predict the frequency of any other specific sequence.

**To illustrate:**

Imagine flipping a coin six times. Getting the sequence Heads-Tails-Heads-Tails-Tails-Heads once doesn't make it any more or less likely that you'll get six Heads in a row in a different set of six flips.

**Therefore, we cannot provide a reliable estimate.**
