Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy and girl births. We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of a different birth order.

**Assumptions**

We need to assume:

* **Equal chance of boy or girl:**  We'll assume there's a roughly 50/50 chance of a child being a boy or a girl. 
* **Independence:** We'll assume the gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next child.

**Logic**

If there's an equal chance of having a boy or girl, then *any* specific birth order of 6 children has the same probability.  This is because each birth has two possibilities (B or G).

**Calculation**

Since every specific birth order has the same probability, the number of families with the order BGBBBB should be roughly the **same** as the number of families with the order GBGBBG.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
