Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Underlying Assumption**

This question relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (which is generally true for large populations). If this assumption holds, then any specific birth order is equally likely as any other.

**Logic**

*  There is only one way to get the order G B G B B G.
*  There is also only one way to get the order B G B B B B. 
*  Since all orders have equal probability, we'd expect to see these two orders about the same number of times in a large enough sample.

**Answer**

Therefore, our best estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is the same as the number with the order G B G B B G.
