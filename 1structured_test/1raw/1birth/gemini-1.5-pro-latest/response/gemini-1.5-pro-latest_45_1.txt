Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

This problem involves probability, specifically the probability of a specific sequence of events (boy or girl births). We're assuming an equal chance of having a boy or girl for each birth.

**Reasoning**

* **Each Birth is Independent:** The sex of one child doesn't influence the sex of any other child.
* **Equal Probability (Simplified):** We're assuming a 50/50 chance for a boy or girl, though in reality, it's slightly more complex.

Since each birth has an equal and independent chance, any specific sequence of 6 children (like BBBBBB, BGBGBG, etc.) has the same probability.

**The Estimate**

Because every sequence of six children is equally likely, we'd expect to find roughly the same number of families with each sequence.  Since we know 45 families had the sequence GBGBBG, we can estimate that approximately **45** families also had the sequence BGBBBB. 

**{answer: 45}**
