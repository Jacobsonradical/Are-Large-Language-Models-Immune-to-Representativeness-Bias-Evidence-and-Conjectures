Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This question relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (which is generally true in real life).  We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of a different, equally specific birth order.

**Logic**

If the probability of having a boy or girl is roughly 50/50, then any specific birth order of 6 children has an equal chance of occurring.  This is because each birth is an independent event.

**Estimate**

Since every specific birth order (including all boys, all girls, or any other sequence) has an equal chance, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB would be roughly the **same** as the number of families with the order GBGBBG.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
