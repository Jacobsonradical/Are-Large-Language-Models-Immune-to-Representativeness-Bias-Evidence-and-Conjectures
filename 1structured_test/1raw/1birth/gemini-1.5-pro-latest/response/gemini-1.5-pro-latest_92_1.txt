Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Assumption**

This problem relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50).  In reality, there can be slight variations, but for this estimation, we'll assume an equal chance.

**Logic**

* **Possible Orders:** For any family with 6 children, there are numerous possible birth orders (BBBGGG, BGBGBG, GGGGGG, etc.). 
* **Equal Likelihood (Theoretically):**  Because we're assuming an equal chance of boy or girl, each specific birth order (like G B G B B G) is as likely as any other specific order (like B G B B B B).

**Estimation**

Since every specific birth order sequence has the same theoretical probability, and we know 45 families had one specific order, it's reasonable to estimate that approximately the same number of families would have any other specific order.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
