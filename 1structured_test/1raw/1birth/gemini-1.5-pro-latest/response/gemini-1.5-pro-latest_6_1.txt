It's impossible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based solely on the number of families with the birth order GBGBBG. Here's why:

* **Independent Events:**  The sex of each child in a family is generally considered an independent event. This means the outcome of one birth (boy or girl) doesn't influence the outcome of the next birth.
* **Equal Probability (roughly):** While not perfectly equal in reality, the probability of having a boy or a girl is close to 50/50.

**Why this matters:**

Knowing that 45 families had a specific birth order doesn't give us any information about how many families will have a completely different specific order. 

**Analogy:**

Imagine flipping a coin six times.  You might get a specific sequence like "Heads-Tails-Heads-Tails-Tails-Heads".  But, knowing this tells you nothing about how many times you'll get a sequence like "Tails-Heads-Tails-Tails-Tails-Tails".

**Conclusion:**

We need more information or assumptions to make an estimate. 

**Answer:** {answer: Cannot estimate}
