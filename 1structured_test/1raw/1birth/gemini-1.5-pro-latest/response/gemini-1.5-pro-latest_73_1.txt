Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Underlying Assumption**

This question relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).  In reality, there can be slight variations, but for this estimation, we'll assume an equal chance.

**Logic**

* **Possible Sequences:**  For any family with 6 children, there are numerous possible birth order sequences (BBGBGB, GGBBGB, etc.).
* **Equal Probability (approximately):**  Because each birth has an approximately equal chance of being a boy or girl, any specific sequence of 6 births has the same probability as any other specific sequence. 

**Conclusion**

Since all sequences have roughly equal probability, we would expect the sequence B G B B B B to occur with about the same frequency as G B G B B G. 

**Answer:**
