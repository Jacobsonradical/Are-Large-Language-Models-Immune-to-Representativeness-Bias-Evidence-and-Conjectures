Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

This problem involves probability, specifically the probability of a specific sequence of events (boy or girl births). We're assuming the probability of having a boy or girl is roughly equal (50/50).

**Logic**

* **Each birth is independent:**  The sex of one child doesn't influence the sex of the next child.
* **Equal probability:**  The chance of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is approximately equal for each birth.

**Why we can't give an exact answer:** We can't say for sure how many families will have the exact order BGBBBB just because 45 families had the order GBGBBG.  The births are random.

**Estimate**

Since the probability of each specific sequence of six births is low, and we're assuming an equal chance of boys and girls, it's reasonable to estimate that the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB would be **similar** to the number of families with the order GBGBBG.

**Answer:**

{answer: Approximately 45}
