Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Assumption**

This question relies on the assumption that the sex of a child at birth is random, with a roughly 50/50 chance of either a boy or a girl.  We also assume there's no biological factor influencing families to have more children of a specific sex.

**Logic**

* **Equal Probability:** If each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or girl, then any specific order of 6 children is equally likely. 
* **Many Possible Orders:** There are many different possible orders for 6 children (2 possibilities for each birth, so 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64 total possible orders).

**Estimate**

Since any order is approximately equally likely, we'd expect the order B G B B B B to occur at a similar rate to the order G B G B B G.  

**Therefore, our estimate is that approximately 45 families were surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B.**

**Answer:** {answer: 45}
