Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy vs. girl births.  We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of another.

**Assumptions**

We need to assume that:

* **Equal Probability:**  The probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (close to 50/50).
* **Independence:**  The sex of one child's birth doesn't influence the sex of the other children.

**Logic**

If the probability of having a boy or girl is approximately equal and independent, then *any* specific birth order of 6 children should be roughly as likely as any other specific birth order. 

**Estimate**

Since we're assuming all birth orders are roughly equally likely, and we know 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately **45 families** also had the order B G B B B B. 

**Answer:**

{answer: 45} 

**Important Note:**  This is a simplified estimate. In reality, there can be slight variations in boy/girl birth ratios, and biological factors can sometimes make certain combinations slightly more likely within individual families. However, for the purpose of this problem, assuming equal probability is a reasonable approach.
