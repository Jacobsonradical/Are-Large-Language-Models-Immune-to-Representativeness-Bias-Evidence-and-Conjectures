It's impossible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based solely on the information given. Here's why:

* **Assumption of Equal Probability:**  We'd have to assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is perfectly equal (50/50) and independent for each birth. In reality, this isn't always the case.
* **Small Sample Size:** 45 families, while it seems like a decent number, might not be representative of the entire city's population and their birth order patterns. 

**To illustrate:**

If we *did* assume perfect 50/50 probability for each birth, the chances of any specific order (like BGBBBB or GBGBBG) would be equal. However, that doesn't mean we'd find an equal number of families with each order in a limited real-world sample.

**Therefore:**

{answer:  Cannot estimate based on the given information}
