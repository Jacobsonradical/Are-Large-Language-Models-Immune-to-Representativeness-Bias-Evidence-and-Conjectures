It's impossible to give a reliable estimate based on the information given. Here's why:

* **Order matters:**  The prompt focuses on the *exact* order of births. This implies that the probability of any specific sequence is likely very low. 
* **Biological sex isn't perfectly random:** While we often simplify birth probabilities to a 50/50 chance, there are slight biological factors that can influence the sex ratio in a population.
* **Small sample size, large extrapolation:** 45 families is a very small sample from a whole city.  Even if G B G B B G was unusually common, extrapolating to a different specific sequence is highly unreliable.

**To get a better estimate, you would need:**

* **Overall birth statistics:**  The general proportion of boys to girls born in the city.
* **Assumptions:**  We'd have to assume the families surveyed are representative of the city's population in terms of family size and sex distribution of children.

**Without this additional information, any estimate would be purely speculative.**
