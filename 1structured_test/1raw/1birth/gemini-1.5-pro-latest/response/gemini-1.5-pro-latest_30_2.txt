It's impossible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order BBBBBB based solely on the number of families with the birth order GBGBBG. Here's why:

* **Independent Events:** The sex of each child's birth is generally considered an independent event.  This means that having one boy doesn't make it more or less likely that the next child will also be a boy.
* **Small Sample Size:**  45 families is a relatively small sample size when considering all possible birth order combinations.

**To illustrate:** Even if we knew that there was an equal chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth, the probability of a specific birth order (like BBBBBB) is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.  This is the same probability as any other specific order, including GBGBBG. 

**Conclusion:**  We don't have enough information to make a reasonable estimate.
