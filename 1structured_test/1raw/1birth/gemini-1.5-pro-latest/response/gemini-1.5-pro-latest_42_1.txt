Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This question relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (which is generally true for large populations).  We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of a different, equally specific birth order.

**Logic**

If the probability of having a boy or girl is approximately equal, then any specific birth order of 6 children should be roughly as likely as any other specific birth order of 6 children. 

**Solution**

Since G B G B B G and B G B B B B are both specific birth orders of 6 children, we would expect them to occur with roughly the same frequency in a large enough sample.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
