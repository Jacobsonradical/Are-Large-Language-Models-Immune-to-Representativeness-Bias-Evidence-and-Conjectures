Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy and girl births.  We're assuming the following:

* **Equal Chance:** There's an approximately equal chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth.
* **Independence:** The gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next child.

**Logic**

If there's a 50/50 chance of having a boy or girl for each birth, then *any specific* order of 6 children is equally likely.  This includes G B G B B G and B G B B B B, or any other sequence.

**Estimate**

Since all sequences are equally likely, if 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we would expect roughly the same number to have the sequence B G B B B B.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
