Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This question relies on the assumption that the sex of one child's birth doesn't influence the sex of other children's births.  In reality, there can be slight variations, but for this problem, we're assuming each birth has an independent 50/50 chance of being a boy or girl.

**Logic**

* **Equal Probability:**  Every specific birth order sequence (like GBBGBG or BGBBBB) has an equal probability of occurring by chance.  
* **Estimating from a Sample:** Since every sequence is equally likely, finding a large number of families with one specific order suggests there should be a similar number of families with any other specific order. 

**Solution**

Since 45 families had the sequence GBBGBG, we'd expect approximately the same number to have the sequence BGBBBB.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
