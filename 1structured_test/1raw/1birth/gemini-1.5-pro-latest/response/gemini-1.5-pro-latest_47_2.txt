Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy and girl births. We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of a different birth order.

**Assumptions**

To solve this, we need to assume:

* **Equal probability of boys and girls:**  We'll assume there's a roughly 50/50 chance of any given birth being a boy or a girl.
* **Independence of births:** We'll assume that the gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of any other child in the family.

**Reasoning**

If we assume an equal chance of each birth order, any specific sequence of 6 births (BBBGGG, BGBGBG, etc.) has the same probability. 

**Estimate**

Since every specific birth order sequence has an equal chance, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB is roughly the **same** as the number of families with the order GBGBBG.

**Answer:**
