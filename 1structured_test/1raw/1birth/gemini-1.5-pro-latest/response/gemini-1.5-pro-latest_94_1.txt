It's impossible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based solely on the number of families with the birth order GBGBBG. Here's why:

* **Independent Events:** The sex of each child's birth is generally considered an independent event. This means the outcome of one birth doesn't influence the outcome of the other births. 
* **Equal Probability (Generally):** While slight variations exist, the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal for each birth.

**Why this matters:**  Knowing that 45 families had a specific birth order doesn't tell us anything about how many families will have a completely different birth order. 

**To illustrate:** Imagine flipping a coin six times.  You might get a specific sequence (like Heads-Tails-Heads-Tails-Tails-Heads). But, that doesn't give you any information about how many times you'll get a different specific sequence (like Tails-Heads-Tails-Tails-Tails-Tails) in a set number of tries.

**Therefore:**  There's no reliable way to estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB from the given information. 

**Answer: {answer: Cannot estimate}**
