Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're assuming an equal chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth. The specific sequence G B G B B G is given as a baseline, and we're asked to estimate how many families might have a different specific sequence (B G B B B B).

**Logic**

* **Each birth is independent:** The gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next.
* **Probability of a specific sequence:** The probability of any specific sequence of 6 births (like GGBBBG or BBBBBB) is the same. This is because each birth has a 1/2 chance of being a boy or girl.

**Estimate**

Since every specific sequence of 6 children is equally likely, we'd expect roughly the same number of families to have each sequence. 

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
