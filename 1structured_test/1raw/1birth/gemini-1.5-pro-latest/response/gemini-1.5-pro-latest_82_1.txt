It's impossible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based solely on the number of families with the birth order GBGBBG. Here's why:

* **Independent Events:**  The sex of each child in a family is generally considered an independent event.  This means that having a girl first doesn't influence the probability of having a boy or girl for subsequent children.
* **Small Sample Size:** 45 families is a relatively small sample size.  Drawing conclusions about the entire city's birth order patterns based on this sample is unreliable.

**To get a reasonable estimate, you would need:**

* **A much larger sample size:** A larger, more representative sample of families from the city.
* **Assumptions:** You might assume the probability of having a boy or girl is roughly equal (close to 50/50).

**Without this additional information, any estimate for the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB would be purely speculative.**

**Answer: {answer: Not enough information to estimate}**
