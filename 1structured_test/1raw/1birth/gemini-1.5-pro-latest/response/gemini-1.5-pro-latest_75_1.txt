It's impossible to estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based solely on the number of families with the birth order GBGBBG. 

Here's why:

* **Randomness of Gender:**  The sex of each child in a family is generally considered an independent event, similar to flipping a coin.  The outcome of one birth doesn't influence the next.
* **Small Sample Size:** Knowing the birth order distribution in 45 families doesn't give us enough information about the likelihood of a specific order in the entire city's population.

**To get a reasonable estimate, we would need:**

* **The total number of families surveyed:** This would give us a sense of the population size.
* **An assumption of equal probability:** We'd need to assume that any specific birth order is roughly as likely as any other.

**Without this information, any estimate would be pure speculation.** 

**Answer:** {answer: Cannot estimate}
