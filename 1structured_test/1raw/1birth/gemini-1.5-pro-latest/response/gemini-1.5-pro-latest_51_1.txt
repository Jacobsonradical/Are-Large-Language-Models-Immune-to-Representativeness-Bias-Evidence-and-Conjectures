Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

This problem relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (which isn't perfectly accurate in reality, but it's a common simplification).  We're also assuming the gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next child.

**Logic**

If the order of births was truly random, any specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) would be equally likely.

**Estimate**

Since every specific birth order sequence has the same likelihood, we'd expect roughly the same number of families to have the B G B B B B sequence as the G B G B B G sequence.
