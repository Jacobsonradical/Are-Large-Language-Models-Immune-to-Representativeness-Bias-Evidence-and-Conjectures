It's impossible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based solely on the number of families with the birth order GBGBBG. Here's why:

* **Independent Events:** The sex of each child in a family is generally considered an independent event (unless there are specific genetic factors). This means the outcome of one birth doesn't influence the outcome of the next.
* **Equal Probability (roughly):**  While not perfectly equal, the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly 50/50.

**Why this matters:**

Knowing that 45 families had the specific order GBGBBG tells us nothing about how many families might have had a different order, even one with all boys. It's like flipping a coin six times and getting a specific sequence – it doesn't change the odds of getting a different sequence in the next set of flips.

**What you would need:**

To estimate the number of families with birth order BGBBBB, you would need:

* **Total Number of Families:** The total number of families surveyed in the city.
* **Assumption:** You'd have to assume the rough 50/50 probability of boys and girls holds true for this population.

**Example:**

If you knew 1000 families were surveyed, and you assumed a 50/50 chance for each birth, a simplified estimate for *any* specific birth order (including BGBBBB) would be:

(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * 1000 families ≈ 16 families
