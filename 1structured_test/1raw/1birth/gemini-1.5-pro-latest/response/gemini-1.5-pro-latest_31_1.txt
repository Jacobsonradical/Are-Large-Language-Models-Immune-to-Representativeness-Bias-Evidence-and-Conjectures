Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making estimations based on a sample.  We're given information about one specific birth order pattern and asked to estimate how often another pattern might occur.

**Key Assumption**

We're assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50). In reality, there can be slight variations, but for this estimation, we'll use this assumption.

**Logic**

* **All patterns are equally likely:** With a 50/50 chance of having a boy or girl, any specific birth order sequence (BBGBGG, GGBBGB, etc.) is equally likely.
* **Our sample represents the larger population:** We're assuming the 45 families surveyed are a representative sample of all families with six children in the city.

**Estimation**

Since all birth order patterns are equally likely, we'd expect the pattern BGBBBB to occur roughly the same number of times as the pattern GBGBBG in the overall population.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
