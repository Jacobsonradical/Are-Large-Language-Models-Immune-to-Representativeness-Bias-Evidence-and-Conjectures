Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making estimations based on a sample.  We're assuming that the sex of each child is like a coin flip â€“ a 50/50 chance. 

**Logic**

1. **Specific Sequence Probability:** The probability of any *specific* birth order for 6 children is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64. This is because there's a 1/2 chance of either gender for each birth.

2. **Equal Likelihood:** Since each specific sequence has an equal probability, we can assume that the order G B G B B G is just as likely as the order B G B B B B, or any other specific order.

**Estimation**

Since we found 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, and all sequences are equally likely, we'd expect to find approximately the same number of families with the sequence B G B B B B.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
