Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making estimations about a larger population based on a sample.  We're assuming that the order of births for boys and girls within a family is essentially random. 

**Logic**

* **Equal Chance:** If we assume an equal chance of having a boy or a girl, any specific birth order sequence of 6 children has the same probability.
* **Sample to Population:**  Since one specific order appeared 45 times in the survey, we can estimate that other specific orders would appear roughly the same number of times.

**Estimate**

Because any specific birth order sequence is equally likely, we'd expect the order B G B B B B to appear a similar number of times as G B G B B G.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
