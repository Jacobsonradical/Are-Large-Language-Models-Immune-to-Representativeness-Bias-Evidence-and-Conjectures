It's highly unlikely that the order of births of boys and girls is anything but random.  This means that any specific sequence of births is equally likely as any other.

Since the specific sequence G B G B B G has no bearing on the likelihood of the sequence B G B B B B, we can assume they have the same probability of occurring.

Therefore, our best estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.
