Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Concept**

This question relies on the assumption that the sex of a child's birth is random, with an approximately equal chance of a boy or a girl.  If we follow this assumption, any specific birth order sequence (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) should have a roughly equal chance of occurring.

**Estimation**

Since each specific birth order sequence has a similar probability, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be similar to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
