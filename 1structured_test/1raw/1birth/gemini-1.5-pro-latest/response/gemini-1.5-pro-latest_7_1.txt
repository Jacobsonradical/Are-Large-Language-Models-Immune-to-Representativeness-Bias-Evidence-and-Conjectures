Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This question deals with the probability of specific birth orders. We're assuming an equal chance of having a boy or girl for each birth. 

**Logic**

* **Each birth is independent:**  The gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next child.
* **Equal probability:** The chance of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is roughly 50/50.

**Estimation**

Since each birth has an approximately equal chance of being a boy or girl, any specific order of 6 children is going to be relatively rare.  The fact that 45 families had the order G B G B B G doesn't change the probability of the order B G B B B B.

**Answer**

Given the roughly equal probability of each birth order, we would expect a similar number of families to have the order B G B B B B. 

**{answer: 45}**
