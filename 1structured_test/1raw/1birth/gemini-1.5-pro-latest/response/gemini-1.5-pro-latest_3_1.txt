Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Assumption**

This question relies on a key assumption: the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).  We also assume births are independent events â€“ having one gender doesn't influence the gender of the next child.

**Logic**

If the chance of having a boy or girl is equal, then *any* specific order of 6 children is equally likely.  This is the same logic that tells us getting heads-tails-heads-tails-tails is just as likely as getting all heads when flipping a coin.

**Estimate**

Since every specific sequence is equally likely, we'd expect the sequence B G B B B B to occur roughly the same number of times as G B G B B G.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
