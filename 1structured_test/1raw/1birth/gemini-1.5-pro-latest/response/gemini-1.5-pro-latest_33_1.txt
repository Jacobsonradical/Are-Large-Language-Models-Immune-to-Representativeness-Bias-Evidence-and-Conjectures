Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're assuming an equal chance of having a boy or girl for each birth. The specific order G B G B B G occurring 45 times is just one particular sequence out of many possible sequences.

**Estimating the Number of Families**

* **Possible Sequences:** With 6 children, there are 2 possible outcomes for each birth (boy or girl).  Therefore, there are 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64 possible sequences.
* **Equal Probability (Theoretically):** If we assume an equal chance of each sequence, we'd expect each of the 64 sequences to appear roughly the same number of times in a large enough sample.
* **Our Estimate:** Since G B G B B G appeared 45 times, and we're assuming a roughly even distribution across all sequences, we'd estimate that B G B B B B also appeared around **45 times**.

**Important Note:**  This is a simplification. In reality, the sex distribution in births isn't perfectly 50/50, and there can be slight variations.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
