Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Assumption**

This question relies on the assumption that the birth order of boys and girls is completely random, like flipping a coin. In reality, this might not be perfectly accurate, but it's how we'll approach the problem.

**Equal Probability**

* If each birth has a 50/50 chance of being a boy or a girl, then any specific order of 6 children is equally likely. 
* Think of it like flipping a coin six times â€“ getting heads (boy) then tails (girl) then heads then tails, etc., is just as likely as any other specific sequence.

**The Estimate**

Since every specific birth order sequence is equally likely, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order BBBBBB should be the **same** as the number of families with the birth order GBGBBG.

**Answer:**
