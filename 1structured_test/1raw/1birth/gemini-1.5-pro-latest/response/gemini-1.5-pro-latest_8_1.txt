Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability, but we have limited information. We're assuming the probability of having a boy or girl is roughly equal (50/50).  The specific order of births (GBGBBG) is just one possible combination among many.

**Estimating the Answer**

Since we're assuming an equal chance of boys and girls, any specific birth order of 6 children is equally likely.  This means that the order BGBBBB is just as likely to occur as GBGBBG.

Therefore, our best estimate for the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB is the same as the number of families with the order GBGBBG.

**Answer:**
