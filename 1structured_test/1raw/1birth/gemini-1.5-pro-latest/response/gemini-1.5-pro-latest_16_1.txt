It's impossible to estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based solely on the number of families with the birth order GBGBBG. Here's why:

* **Randomness of Gender:** The sex of each child in a family is generally considered an independent event, similar to flipping a coin.  Just because one family has a specific order doesn't influence the order in another family.
* **Small Sample Size:**  Even if we knew the overall probability of a BGBBBB birth order, 45 families is a very small sample size to make accurate predictions about a specific, different order.

**To make an estimate, we would need additional information, such as:**

* The overall birth rate of boys vs. girls in the city.
* A much larger sample size of families. 

**Therefore, there is no reasonable basis for providing an estimate.**

**{answer: cannot estimate}**
