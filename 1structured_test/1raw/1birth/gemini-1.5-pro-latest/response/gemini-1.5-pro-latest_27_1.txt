Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

This question relies on the assumption that the sex of one child in a family does not influence the sex of any other child.  Essentially, we're dealing with a series of coin flips – each birth has about a 50/50 chance of being a boy or girl.

**Logic**

* **Equal Probability:** If each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or girl, then any specific order of 6 children is equally likely. 
* **Irrelevant Information:**  The fact that 45 families had the order G B G B B G is irrelevant to the probability of another order occurring. It's like flipping a coin six times and getting heads every time – it doesn't change the odds of getting a different sequence on the next six flips.

**Estimate**

Since every order of boys and girls is equally likely, we'd expect the order B G B B B B to occur with roughly the same frequency as G B G B B G.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
