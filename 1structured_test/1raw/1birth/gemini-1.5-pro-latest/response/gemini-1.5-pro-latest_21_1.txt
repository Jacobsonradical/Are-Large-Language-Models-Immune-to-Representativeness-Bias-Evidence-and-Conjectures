Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Situation**

* We're assuming an equal chance of having a boy or girl for each birth.
* The specific order of births is important in this problem.

**Logic**

The probability of any specific birth order for 6 children is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64.  This is because there's a 1/2 chance of either gender for each of the six births.

Since each unique birth order sequence has the same probability, we can estimate that roughly the same number of families will have each sequence.

**Estimate**

Because we found 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, and all sequences have an equal likelihood, we'd expect approximately the same number of families to have the sequence B G B B B B.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
