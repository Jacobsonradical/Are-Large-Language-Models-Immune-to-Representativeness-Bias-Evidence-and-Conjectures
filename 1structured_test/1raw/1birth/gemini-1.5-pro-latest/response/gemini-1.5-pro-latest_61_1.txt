Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem highlights a potential misconception about the probability of birth orders.  Many people assume that all birth orders are equally likely, but that's not necessarily true. 

**Why the given information matters**

The fact that 45 families had the specific order G B G B B G is interesting, but it doesn't directly tell us how many families had the order B G B B B B.  There's no direct mathematical relationship between the frequencies of these two specific orders.

**Making an Assumption**

To make an estimate, we need to assume that, in the absence of other information, each birth within a family has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl (approximately 50/50 in reality).

**Estimating the Probability**

* Each specific birth order of 6 children has a probability of (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64.  This is because there are two equally likely possibilities for each birth (boy or girl).

**The Estimate**

If we assume that all birth orders are approximately equally likely, then we'd expect the order B G B B B B to occur at a similar rate to the given order (G B G B B G).

**Therefore, our estimate is that approximately 45 families also had the birth order B G B B B B.**

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
