It's impossible to estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based solely on the number of families with the birth order GBGBBG. Here's why:

* **Independent Events:** The sex of each child in a family is generally considered an independent event.  The outcome of one birth doesn't influence the outcome of the next. 
* **Small Sample Size:**  Knowing the birth order pattern of 45 families doesn't give us enough information about the overall distribution of birth order patterns in the entire city.

**To make a reasonable estimate, we would need:**

* **A larger sample size:**  A much larger sample of families would provide a more representative picture of birth order probabilities.
* **Assumptions:** We might assume an equal probability of having a boy or girl for each birth, but even this is a simplification.

**In conclusion:**  We cannot provide a reliable estimate without more information.
