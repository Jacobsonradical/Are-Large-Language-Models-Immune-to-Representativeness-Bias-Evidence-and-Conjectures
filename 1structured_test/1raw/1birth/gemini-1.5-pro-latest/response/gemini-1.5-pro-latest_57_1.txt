Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

The prompt highlights a very specific birth order for six children.  Assuming an equal chance of having a boy or girl for each birth, any specific birth order is equally likely. 

**Estimating the Number**

Since each unique birth order has the same probability, we'd expect the same number of families to have each possible order. Given that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we would estimate a similar number for the order B G B B B B.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
