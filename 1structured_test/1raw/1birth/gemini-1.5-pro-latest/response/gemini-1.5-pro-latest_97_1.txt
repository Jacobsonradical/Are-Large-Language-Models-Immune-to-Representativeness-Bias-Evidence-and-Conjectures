Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with the probability of specific birth orders in families with six children.  The key assumption is that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).

**Reasoning**

* **Symmetry:** The order G B G B B G and B G B B B B are symmetrical.  This means that for every family with the first birth order, it's equally likely to have a family with the second birth order, assuming boys and girls are equally probable.

**Estimation**

Since we're assuming an equal chance of each birth order, and the given order is symmetrical to the one we're estimating, it's reasonable to believe that approximately the same number of families would have the B G B B B B order.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
