Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Underlying Assumption**

This question relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50). In reality, there can be slight variations, but for the sake of this estimation, we'll assume an equal chance.

**The Logic**

* **Equal Probability:**  Every specific birth order of 6 children has an equal probability. This is because each birth has an independent 1/2 chance of being a boy or a girl.
* **Estimating from a Sample:** The fact that 45 families had the order G B G B B G gives us a snapshot of the distribution.  Since all birth orders are equally likely, we'd expect roughly the same number of families for any other specific order.

**Estimate**

Given the logic above, our best estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

**{answer: 45}**
