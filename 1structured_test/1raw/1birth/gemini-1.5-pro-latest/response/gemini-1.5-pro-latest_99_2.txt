Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and making assumptions about the likelihood of boy and girl births.  We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of a different specific birth order.

**Assumptions**

We need to make a key assumption to solve this:

* **Equal Probability:** We'll assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).  

**Logic**

If the probability of having a boy or girl is equal, then any specific birth order of 6 children has the same probability.  This is because each birth is an independent event.

**Estimate**

Since every specific birth order has the same probability under our assumption, we'd expect the birth order B G B B B B to occur roughly the same number of times as G B G B B G.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
