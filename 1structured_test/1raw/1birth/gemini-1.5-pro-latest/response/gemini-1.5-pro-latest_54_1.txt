Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Concept**

This problem revolves around the probability of specific birth orders.  Assuming an equal chance of a boy (B) or girl (G) birth for each child, any specific birth order of 6 children is equally likely.

**The Logic**

* There are numerous possible birth order combinations for 6 children (2 possibilities for each birth, so 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64 total combinations). 
* The specific sequence "GBGBBG" is just one of those combinations.
* Since all combinations are equally likely, the sequence "BGBBBB" should theoretically occur with the same frequency as "GBGBBG".

**The Estimate**

Given the logic above, if 45 families had the sequence "GBGBBG", we would expect approximately the same number to have the sequence "BGBBBB".

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
