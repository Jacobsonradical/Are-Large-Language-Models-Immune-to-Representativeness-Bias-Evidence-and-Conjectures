Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

This question relies on the assumption that the sex of one child's birth does not influence the sex of other children's births.  We're essentially dealing with a series of coin flips – each birth has roughly a 50/50 chance of being a boy or girl.

**Estimating the Probability**

* Each specific birth order of 6 children has the same probability. Think of it like flipping a coin six times – every specific sequence of heads and tails is equally likely.
* Since each birth has two possibilities (boy or girl), there are 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64 possible birth orders.

**Estimating the Number of Families**

If 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, and every birth order is equally likely, we can estimate that approximately 45 families will have each of the other birth orders, including B G B B B B.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
