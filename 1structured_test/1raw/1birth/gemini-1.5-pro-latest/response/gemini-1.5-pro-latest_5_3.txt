Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This question relies on the assumption that the sex of a child at birth is random and has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl (about 50/50).  We're given data from families with a specific birth order and asked to estimate the number of families with a different birth order.

**Logic**

* **Equal Probability:** If each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or girl, then any specific birth order of 6 children is equally likely. 
* **Irrelevant Information:** The fact that 45 families had the order G B G B B G is interesting but doesn't actually change the probability of the other birth order (B G B B B B) occurring.

**Estimation**

Since every possible birth order is equally likely, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is roughly the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G. 

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
