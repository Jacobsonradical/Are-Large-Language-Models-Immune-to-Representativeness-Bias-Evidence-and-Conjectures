It's impossible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based solely on the number of families with the birth order GBGBBG. Here's why:

* **Independent Events:**  The sex of each child in a family is generally considered an independent event.  This means that the sex of one child doesn't influence the sex of the next child. 
* **Equal Probability (roughly):** While not perfectly equal, the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly 50/50.

**Why this matters:**

Knowing that 45 families had a specific birth order doesn't give us any information about how many families might have a completely different order.  

**Analogy:**

Imagine flipping a coin six times.  You might get a specific sequence (like Heads-Tails-Heads-Tails-Tails-Heads).  But knowing this sequence occurred tells you nothing about how many times a different sequence (like Tails-Heads-Tails-Tails-Tails-Tails) might occur if you repeated the experiment many times.

**Conclusion:**

We need more information or data to estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB. 

**Answer:** {answer: Cannot estimate based on the provided information}
