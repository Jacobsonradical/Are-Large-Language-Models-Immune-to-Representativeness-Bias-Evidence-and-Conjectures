It's impossible to estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based on the information given. Here's why:

* **We don't know the overall boy/girl ratio:** The fact that 45 families had the order GBGBBG doesn't tell us anything about the general likelihood of having a boy versus a girl in this city. 
* **Birth order isn't perfectly random:**  While there's a strong element of chance, factors like family planning can influence the sex distribution of children.

**To make an estimate, we'd need more information, such as:**

* The total number of families surveyed.
* The overall proportion of boys to girls born in the city.

**Therefore, there's no valid way to provide an answer in the requested format.**
