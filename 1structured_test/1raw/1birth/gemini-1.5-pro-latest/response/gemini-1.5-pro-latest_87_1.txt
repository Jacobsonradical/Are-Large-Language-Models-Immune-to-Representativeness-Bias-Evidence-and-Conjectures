Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

This problem relies on the assumption that the birth of a boy or girl is equally likely, similar to a coin flip.  We're given information about one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of another.

**Logic**

* **Equal Probability:** If each birth has a 50/50 chance of being a boy or girl, any specific order of 6 children is equally likely. 
* **Irrelevant Information:**  The fact that 45 families had the order G B G B B G is interesting but doesn't directly help us calculate the probability of the order B G B B B B.

**Estimate**

Since every specific birth order has the same likelihood, we'd expect the order B G B B B B to occur roughly the same number of times as G B G B B G in a large enough sample.

**{answer: 45}** 
 
**Important Note:** This is an estimate. In reality, slight variations in birth rates and other factors could mean the actual number of families with the order B G B B B B might be slightly higher or lower than 45.
