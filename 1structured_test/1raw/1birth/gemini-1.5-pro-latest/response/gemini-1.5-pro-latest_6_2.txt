Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Situation**

This problem relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).  We're also assuming there are no factors influencing the sex of children in a specific order.

**Logic**

* **Specific Order is Unlikely:**  Any specific birth order (like GBGBBG or BGBBBB) is statistically unlikely.
* **Equal Probability:** Since the chance of having a boy or girl is roughly equal, we can assume that different specific birth orders should occur with roughly the same frequency over a large sample size.

**Estimate**

Given this logic, if 45 families have the birth order GBGBBG, we would expect a very similar number to have the birth order BGBBBB.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
