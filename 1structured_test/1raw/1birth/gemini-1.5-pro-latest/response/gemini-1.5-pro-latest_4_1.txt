Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

This problem involves probability and assumptions about the likelihood of boy vs. girl births. We're given data on one specific birth order and asked to estimate the frequency of a different birth order.

**Assumptions**

To solve this, we need to assume:

* **Equal probability of boys and girls:**  We'll assume there's a roughly 50/50 chance of a child being a boy or a girl.
* **Independence of births:** We'll assume the gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next child.

**Logic**

If the probability of having a boy or girl is equal and independent for each birth, then *every unique birth order of 6 children has the same probability*.  Since the specific order G B G B B G has 45 occurrences, we'd expect any other unique order (like B G B B B B) to have a similar number of occurrences.

**Answer**

{answer: 45} 

**Important Note:** In reality, the sex ratio at birth isn't exactly 50/50, and there can be slight variations. However, without more information, assuming equal probability is the best approach for this estimation.
