Here's how to approach this problem and provide an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with the probability of specific birth orders in families with six children.  The assumption is that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50/50).

**Logic**

* **Each birth is independent:** The gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next child.
* **Specific order probability:** The probability of any specific birth order (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is the same.  Since there are two equally likely possibilities for each birth (boy or girl), the probability of a specific sequence of six births is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64.

**Estimate**

Since the probability of each specific birth order is equal, we'd expect roughly the same number of families to have each sequence. 

**Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.**

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
