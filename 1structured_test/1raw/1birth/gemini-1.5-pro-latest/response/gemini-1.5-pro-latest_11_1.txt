Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Assumption**

This problem relies on the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50). In reality, there can be slight variations, but we'll work with this assumption for the problem.

**Logic**

* **Equal Probability:**  If the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, then every specific birth order for 6 children has the same probability. 
* **Specific Order:** The sequence G B G B B G is just one specific order out of many possible orders for six children.
* **Estimating from a Sample:** The 45 families with the G B G B B G order represent a small sample of all the families with six children in the city.

**Conclusion**

Since every specific birth order has an equal chance, we'd expect roughly the same number of families to have the B G B B B B order as the G B G B B G order.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
