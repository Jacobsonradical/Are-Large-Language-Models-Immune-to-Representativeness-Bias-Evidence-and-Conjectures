I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand the concept and provide an answer based on logical reasoning.

The question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy.

The question also mentions that there are 45 families with the order G, B, G, B, B, G. This implies that the order B, G, B, B, G, B is not as common, as we would expect the number of families to be symmetrical around the middle if the order of births did not matter.

So, while I can't provide an exact number without the actual data, it's reasonable to estimate that there are fewer families with the order B, G, B, B, G, B than families with the order G, B, G, B, B, G. Therefore, your estimate could be less than 45 families.
