I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem if you had the data.

The question asks for the number of families where the exact order of births is Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. If we consider the first birth as a choice between a boy or a girl, there are 2 possibilities. For the second birth, regardless of the first, there are also 2 possibilities. This pattern continues for all 6 births.

Since the order matters, we need to multiply these possibilities for each birth. So, the total number of ways to arrange B's and G's for 6 children is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 64.

However, we know that the survey results included 45 families with the specific order G B G B B G. This means that there are 64 - 45 = 19 families with the order B G B B B B.

So, your estimate would be:
{answer: 19}
