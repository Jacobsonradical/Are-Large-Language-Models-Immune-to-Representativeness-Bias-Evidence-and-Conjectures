To answer this question, we first need to understand that the order of births for boys and girls can be reversed without changing the family's gender composition or the fact that all six children are accounted for. Therefore, the order B G B B B G is equivalent to the order B G B B B B G with the words "Boy" and "Girl" swapped.

Now, let's consider the possible orders for six children with three boys (B) and three girls (G). There are two ways to arrange three boys and three girls in a row without specifying their exact positions:

1. B B B G G G (3! * 3! = 6 * 6 = 36 ways)
2. B B G G B B G (3! * 3! = 6 * 6 = 36 ways)

Since the order B G B B B G is equivalent to B B B G G B B G, we have double the number of families with this specific order of births. However, we already know that there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, which implies there are 45 families with the order B G B B B G (since they are equivalent).

Now, to find the number of families with the order B G B B B B G, we can subtract the number of families with the order G B G B B G from the total number of families with three boys and three girls:

Total families = Number of families with B G B B B G + Number of families with B G B B B B G (swapped)
              = 45 + 45
              = 90 families

The number of families with the order B G B B B B G is equal to the number of families with the order B G B B B B G (swapped), which is half of the total number of families with three boys and three girls:

Number of families with B G B B B B G = Total families / 2
                                  = 90 / 2
                                  = 45 families

Therefore, our estimate is:
{answer: 45 families}
