To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations. However, since we only need the gender (boy or girl) for each child, we can consider this as a problem of combinations.

In a family of six children, there are two gender types (B for boy and G for girl). The number of ways to arrange 6 'B's and 6 'G's in a row (without considering the order) is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items (in this case, 6 boys and 6 girls), and r is the number of items to choose at a time (in this case, 1 boy or 1 girl).

So, the number of ways to arrange boys and girls in this order is C(12, 6) = 12! / (6!(12-6)!) = 924.

However, when arranging the order of boys and girls, we are double-counting families with a different starting gender. For example, B G B B B B and G B G B B B B are considered as two different arrangements, but they represent the same family. To account for this, let's find the number of arrangements with an odd number of boys first, and then divide by 2.

There are C(12, 5) = 792 ways to arrange 5 boys and 7 girls, and C(12, 7) = 924 ways to arrange 7 boys and 5 girls. Since we double-counted families with an odd number of boys, the number of unique families is half of the sum of these two combinations: 792 + 924 / 2 = 1372 / 2 = 686.

However, in the problem statement, we are only given the exact order of births as G B G B B G, which is a family with an even number of boys. Since there were 686 families with an odd number of boys, and only one family with an even number of boys (G B G B B G), we can subtract 686 from our estimate.

So, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is 686 - 1 = 685.
