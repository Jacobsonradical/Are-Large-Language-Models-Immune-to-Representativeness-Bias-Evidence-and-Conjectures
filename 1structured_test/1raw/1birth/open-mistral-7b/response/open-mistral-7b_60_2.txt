I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using basic principles of probability.

Given that there are 6 children in each family (3 boys and 3 girls), and we're interested in the order of their births, we can treat this as a permutation problem. The total number of permutations of 6 items (children) is 6! (6 factorial), which equals 720.

Now, let's consider the specific order of births you're interested in: B G B B B B. This has 6 positions filled by 3 B's and 3 G's. To find the number of ways this specific order can occur, we can treat it as a combination problem. The total number of ways to choose 3 positions for the 3 boys is C(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * 3!) = 20.

So, there are 20 families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B.

However, since we're asking for an estimate, it's important to note that this is a fixed order and doesn't account for families with reversed orders, interchanged boys and girls, etc. Without more information about the distribution of birth orders in the population, it's difficult to provide a more refined estimate.

Therefore, based on the specific order you've provided, my estimate is that there are 20 families with this exact order of births. For a more accurate estimate, additional data would be required.
