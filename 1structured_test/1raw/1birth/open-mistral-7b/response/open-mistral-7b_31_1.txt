I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using basic probability concepts.

In a family of six children, there are 15 different orders for the birth of boys and girls (assuming no twins). If the exact order of births is G B G B B G, there are 5 positions for the first boy (B), and once he's placed, there are 4 remaining positions for the 5 girls (G), so the number of ways to arrange B G B B B G is 5C1 * 4C5 = 5 * 1 = 5 ways.

If 45 families have the order G B G B B G, and there are 15 different orders, the proportion of families with this specific order is 45/15 = 3.

Since there are no restrictions on the number of families with any particular order, we can estimate that the number of families with the order B G B B B B B is also 3 times the total number of families surveyed.

So, the answer to your question in the requested format is:
{answer: 3 * number_of_total_surveyed_families}

To find the actual number, you would need to know the total number of families surveyed.
