I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

The question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. In this case, the order is important.

If we assume that the gender of each child is independent of the gender of the other children, then the probability of having a boy or girl in any given birth is 0.5.

The probability of having the exact order of B G B B B G in six children is (0.5)^6 * 6!, where 6! is the factorial of 6, which represents the number of ways to arrange 6 distinct objects.

However, the question only gives us the number of families with the order of B G G B B G, not B G B B B B G. To find the number of families with the latter, we need to know the number of families with the former and subtract it from the total number of families with some order of B and G.

Without knowing the total number of families with some order of B and G, I'm unable to provide an exact estimate. If you had that information, you could calculate the difference to find the estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B G.
