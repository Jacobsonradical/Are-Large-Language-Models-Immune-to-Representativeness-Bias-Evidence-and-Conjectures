I'm an AI and I don't have real-time data or the ability to conduct surveys. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem if you were to conduct the survey yourself.

The question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. Since the question is about order, we can consider the first child as any gender (B or G).

There are 2 possible ways to start this sequence with a boy (BBGGGB) and 2 ways to start with a girl (BGGBGBG). So, in total, there are 2 x 4 = 8 different ways to start the sequence with a boy or a girl.

For each of these starting sequences, there are 5 positions left to fill with the remaining B and G children. Since there are 2 types of children, the next 5 positions must alternate between B and G. This means that there are only 1 way to fill the remaining positions.

Therefore, the total number of families with this exact order of births is 8 (different starting sequences) x 1 (unique way to fill the remaining positions) = 8 families.

However, since the question asks for an estimate, and this is a precise calculation, it might be more appropriate to say that there are approximately 8 families. But remember, this is an estimate based on the assumption that the order of births is random and follows the given pattern. In reality, the exact number could be slightly different due to random variations.

{answer: approximately 8 families}
