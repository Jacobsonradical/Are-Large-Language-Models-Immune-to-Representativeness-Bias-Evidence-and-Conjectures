I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using basic probability concepts.

There are 2 types of orderings for 6 children (boys and girls):
1. Ordering with at least 1 boy first (B*G*G*G*G or B*G*G*G*B or B*G*G*B*G or B*G*B*G*G or B*G*B*G*B or B*B*G*G*G or B*B*G*G*B or B*B*G*B*G or B*B*B*G*G or B*B*B*G*B)
2. Ordering with all girls first (G*G*G*G*G)

Let's calculate the probability of each type of ordering:

1. Probability of ordering with at least 1 boy first:
There are 11 ways to arrange 6 children with at least 1 boy first (as shown above).
So, the probability is 11/C(6, 2) = 11/15

2. Probability of ordering with all girls first:
There is 1 way to arrange 6 girls in the order G*G*G*G*G
So, the probability is 1/C(6, 5) = 1/6

Now, to find the number of families with all boys first (B*B*B*B*B*B), we can subtract the probability of ordering with at least 1 boy first from 1.

So, the number of families with all boys first is approximately:
{answer: 1 - (11/15) - (1/6) â‰ˆ 3/10}

However, without specific data, this is an estimate and not an exact number. The actual number may differ from this estimate based on the distribution of births in the city.
