I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or gather data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the necessary data.

The question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. We know the number of families with the exact order of Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl. To find the number of families with the reversed order, we can use the concept of permutations.

Permutations are arrangements of objects where the order matters. In this case, the objects are boys and girls, and there are 6 of each (12 objects in total). The number of permutations of 12 objects with 6 identical objects of one type (boys) and 6 identical objects of another type (girls) is given by the formula:

12! / (6! * 6!)

where "!" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

However, since we only care about the order of boys (B) and girls (G), not their specific identities, we can divide this value by 2 to account for the fact that the positions of the boys and girls can be switched without changing the order.

So, the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl Girl is half of the number of permutations of 12 objects with 6 identical objects of one type and 6 identical objects of another type.

Unfortunately, without knowing the number of families with the exact order of Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl Girl, I can't provide an estimate for the number of families with the exact order of Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Boy. I hope this helps you understand how you might approach this problem if you had the necessary data.
