To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of complementary probability. First, let's find out the probability of having at least one boy born first (B).

Since there are six children in each family, there are C(6, 1) = 6 ways to choose the first position for the boy. For the remaining five positions, there are C(5, 5) = 1 ways to arrange the five girls in the order B G B B B. So, the total number of families with at least one boy born first is 6 * 1 = 6.

Now, let's find the number of families with all girls born first (B G B B B B is not possible). Since there are six girls, there are C(6, 6) = 1 ways to arrange the all girls. So, there are only 1 family with all girls born first.

Finally, we can find the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B by subtracting the number of families with at least one boy born first from the total number of families:

Total families = Number of families with at least one boy born first + Number of families with all girls born first

Since we are given the number of families with at least one boy born first, we can calculate the number of families with all girls born first and find the total number of families:

Total families = 6 + 1 = 7 families

Now, we can calculate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B:

Number of families with B G B B B B = Total families - Number of families with at least one boy born first

= 7 - 6

= 1 family

However, since we are looking for an estimate based on the given data, it is unreasonable to assume that there is only 1 family with the exact order of births as B G B B B B. Therefore, we cannot provide a reliable estimate based on the given information.
