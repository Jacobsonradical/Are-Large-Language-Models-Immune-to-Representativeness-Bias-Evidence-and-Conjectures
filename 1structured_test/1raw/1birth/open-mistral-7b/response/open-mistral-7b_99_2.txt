To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations. In a family of six children, there are two possibilities for the first child (boy or girl). Once we decide the gender of the first child, there are still five positions left for the remaining five children.

For the family with the order B G B B B B, we have decided the gender of the first and sixth children. Now, we have four positions for the remaining three boys. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange these three boys, which equals 6.

Similarly, for the family with the order B G B B B G, we have decided the gender of the first and fifth children. Now, we have four positions for the remaining three girls. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange these three girls, which also equals 6.

Since the genders of the first and sixth children do not affect the arrangement of the remaining children, the number of families with the order B G B B B B is equal to the number of families with the order B G B B B G.

However, in our initial question, we were told that there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G. Since there are twice as many families with the order B G B B B G as families with the order G B G B B G, there must be 45 / 2 = 22.5 families with the order B G B B B B, which is not possible.

There seems to be an error in the given information, and it's not possible to provide an accurate estimate based on the provided data.
