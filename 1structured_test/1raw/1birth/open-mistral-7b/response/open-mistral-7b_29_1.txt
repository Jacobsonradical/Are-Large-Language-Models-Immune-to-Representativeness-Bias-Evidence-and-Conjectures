To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the exact number of families with this specific birth order is not provided. One reasonable assumption is that the probability of having a boy or girl birth is equal, which is often assumed to be 0.5.

Given that there are six children in each family, the number of ways to arrange these children in a sequence of boys and girls is given by the Bell number B(6), which is the number of partitions of a set with 6 elements. The formula for Bell numbers is B(n) = sum from k=1 to n of B(k-1) * (n-k+1)! / k!

However, calculating the Bell number for B(6) is complex and beyond the scope of this platform. We can simplify the problem by assuming that the order of births for boys and girls is independent, meaning the probability of having a boy or girl birth does not depend on the previous births.

In this case, we can calculate the probability of having a specific sequence of births by multiplying the probabilities of having each boy or girl birth. Since we assume the probability of a boy or girl birth is 0.5, the probability of having the exact order of births B G B B B B is 0.5^6 = 0.015625.

Now, to estimate the number of families with this specific birth order, we multiply the probability of having this order by the number of families with the order G B G B B G, which we know is 45:

{answer: 45 * 0.015625} = 0.71875 or approximately 1 family in 1.4.

Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a family, we can round up or down depending on our interpretation of the problem. If we round down, our estimate would be that there is 0 family with this specific birth order. If we round up, our estimate would be that there is 1 family with this specific birth order.

In conclusion, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is either 0 or 1.
