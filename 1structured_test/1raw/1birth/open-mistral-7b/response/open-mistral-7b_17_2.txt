I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can provide some insight based on the information given.

The question mentions that the exact order of births for 45 families was G B G B B G. Since each family has six children, there are a total of 6! (factorial) or 720 possible orders of births for six children.

Since we know one order (G B G B B G), we can subtract this known order from the total to find the number of other possible orders. So, the number of other possible orders is 720 - 1 = 719.

However, we need to consider that half of these orders will be the reverse of the one we know (B G B B B G becomes G B B G B G B). So, we need to divide the number of other possible orders by 2: 719 / 2 = 359.5.

Since it's not possible to have half a family, it seems there might be an error or missing information in the question. If the question is meant to ask for the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B, then the answer should be 0, as the question provided only one example of a family with that order.

In summary, based on the information given, it's not possible to provide a precise answer. It seems there might be an error or missing information in the question.
