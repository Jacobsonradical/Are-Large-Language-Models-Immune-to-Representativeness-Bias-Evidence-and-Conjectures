I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can provide some reasoning based on the information given.

The question states that there are 45 families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G. Since the gender of the first child is a girl (G), the remaining five children can be either boys (B) or girls (G), but the order must be B G B B B for the last four positions.

Now, let's consider the case when the first child is a boy. In this case, the order of births must be B G G G G G, which is not mentioned in the question. So, it seems that all the 45 families with the given order have the first child as a girl.

Since the gender of the first child is fixed as a girl, the number of families with the order B G B B B B should be equal to the total number of families minus the number of families with the order G B G B B G. However, the question does not provide the total number of families surveyed.

Without this information, I'm unable to provide an exact estimate. I would recommend conducting additional research or gathering more data to find the total number of families and then calculate the difference to find the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
