I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct surveys or gather real-world data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem if you had the data.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy. Let's call this order pattern "BBBBGG".

To find an estimate for the number of families with this pattern, you would need to know the total number of families with six children and the number of families with the specific G B G B B G pattern. However, you've only been given the number of families with the G B G B B G pattern.

Since the order of boys and girls doesn't matter in a permutation (as long as there are more boys than girls in this case), we can assume that the number of families with the BBBBGG pattern is the same as the number of families with the GBBBGG pattern.

If the number of families with the G B G B B G pattern is 45, then your estimate for the number of families with the BGBBBG pattern would be the same. Therefore, your estimate would be:

{answer: 45}

Again, this is an estimate based on the assumption that the number of families with the BGBBBG pattern is the same as the number of families with the GBBBGG pattern, which is not confirmed in the information given.
