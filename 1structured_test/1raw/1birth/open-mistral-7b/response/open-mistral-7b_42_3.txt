I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand the problem and suggest a method to estimate the number of families.

In this case, there are six positions for the children's births, and we know that in 45 families, the order was G B G B B G. Since there are two genders, we can assume that for every family with a certain order, there should be another family with the opposite order of the same gender.

Given this, we can estimate that the number of families with the order B G B B B B could be equal to the number of families with the order G B G B B G, which is 45.

So, your estimate could be:
{answer: 45}
