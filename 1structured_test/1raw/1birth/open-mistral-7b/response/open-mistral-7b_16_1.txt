To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the exact number of families with the specific order of births B G B B B B is not provided. One reasonable assumption could be that the frequency of boys and girls being born is roughly equal. In that case, we might expect that the order B G B B B B would be as rare as G B G B B B G.

Since we know that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can infer that the number of families with the order B G B B B B G may be similar. However, without more specific data, it's impossible to provide an exact number.

So, based on the assumption that the birth order of boys and girls is roughly equal, our estimate would be that there are approximately 45 families with the order B G B B B B B.

{answer: approximately 45 families}
