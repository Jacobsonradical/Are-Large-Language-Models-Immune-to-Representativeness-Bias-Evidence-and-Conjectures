I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

In a family of six children, there are 7 possible places for the first boy (B) to be born (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, or not at all if all are girls). Once the first boy is placed, there are 6 places left for the girls (G). So, for the pattern B G B B B G, there are 7 * 6 = 42 possible arrangements.

In your survey, you found 45 families with the pattern G B G B B G. Since there are only two possible patterns with 3 boys and 3 girls (B G B B B G and G B G B B G), the number of families with the pattern B G B B B B G should be equal to the number of families with the pattern G B G B B G minus the number of families with the pattern G B G B B G (since they've already been counted).

So, your estimate would be:

{answer: 45 - 42 = 3 families}

Again, I must emphasize that as a text-based AI, I don't have the ability to collect or analyze data. This is just an example of how you might approach the problem if you had the necessary data.
