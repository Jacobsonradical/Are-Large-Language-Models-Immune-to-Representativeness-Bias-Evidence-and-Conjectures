To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the information given does not provide enough data to determine the exact number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Assuming that the gender of a child is randomly distributed, we can estimate the probability of having six boys in a row to be very low. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is significantly less than the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

However, without specific data or a mathematical model to calculate the probabilities, I cannot provide an exact number. Therefore, my estimate is:

{answer: less than 45 families}
