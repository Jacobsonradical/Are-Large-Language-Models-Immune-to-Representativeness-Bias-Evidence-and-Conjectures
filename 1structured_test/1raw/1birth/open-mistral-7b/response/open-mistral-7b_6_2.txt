I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families with six children where the exact order of births is Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy.

Since we know the number of families with the order G B G B B G is 45, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

The two orders are reversed, so if there are N families with the order B G B B B B, then there should be N families with the order G B G B B G.

Since we have 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and we know that the two orders are reversed, we can estimate that there are also 45 families with the order B G B B B B.

So, the answer is:
{answer: 45}
