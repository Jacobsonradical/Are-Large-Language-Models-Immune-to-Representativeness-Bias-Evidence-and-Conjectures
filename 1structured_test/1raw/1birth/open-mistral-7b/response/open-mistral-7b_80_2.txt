To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the survey only provided information about families with the specific order G B G B B G. Without more data, it's not possible to accurately estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

However, if we assume that the gender of the first child is random and independent of the gender of the next child (which is a common assumption in probability), then we can use the concept of symmetry to make an estimate.

If the gender of the first child is random, then there should be as many families with the order B G B B B B as there are with G B G B B G. Since there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we could estimate that there are also 45 families with the order B G B B B B.

So, {answer: 45} would be an estimate based on this assumption. However, remember that this is just an estimate, and without more data, it's impossible to say for sure.
