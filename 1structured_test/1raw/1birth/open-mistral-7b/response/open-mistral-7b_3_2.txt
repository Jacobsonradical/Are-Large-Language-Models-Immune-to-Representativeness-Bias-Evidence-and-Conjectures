I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy.

Since the gender of the first child does not affect the order of the subsequent five, we can consider the first child as either a boy or a girl, and then find the number of possibilities for the remaining five children.

There are 2 possibilities for the first child: Boy or Girl. For the remaining five children, the order is fixed as Boy, Girl, Boy, Boy, Girl. So, the number of possibilities for the remaining five children is 2 (for the first child) times 1 (since the order is fixed) = 2.

Therefore, the total number of families with this exact order is the number of possibilities for the first child times the fixed order: 2 times 1 = 2 families.

However, since the question asks for an estimate, it implies that we don't have exact numbers and are guessing based on incomplete or uncertain information. In this case, without more context or information, it's not possible to provide an estimate.

So, in the format you requested:
{answer: I cannot provide an estimate.}
