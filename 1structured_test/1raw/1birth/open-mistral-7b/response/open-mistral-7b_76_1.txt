To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the gender distribution in births, as the information given does not provide enough data to determine the exact number of families with all boys or all girls. Let's assume a common gender ratio of 1.05 boys per girl (approximately 51% boys and 49% girls).

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to arrange six children with two specified gender types (e.g., BBBBBB or BBBBGG). For simplicity, we can consider arranging three boys and three girls at once (since the order of boys and girls is fixed in the question). Using the formula for permutations, we have:

Number of arrangements = n! / (n1! * n2!)
where n is the total number of children, n1 is the number of children of type 1 (boys), and n2 is the number of children of type 2 (girls).

Since we've assumed 1.05 boys per girl, the number of girls will be rounded up to ensure we account for at least one boy per family.

n1 = 3 (boys)
n2 = 4 (rounded up girls)

Now, we can calculate the number of arrangements for both possible orders:

1. Order B G B B B G
Number of arrangements = 6! / (3! * 3!)
= 720 / (6 * 6)
= 20

2. Order B B G B B G
Number of arrangements = 6! / (3! * 3!)
= 720 / (6 * 6)
= 20

Now, let's calculate the number of families with all boys or all girls, assuming a gender ratio of 1.05 boys per girl:

1. Families with all boys:
Number of arrangements = 6! / (3! * 3!)
= 720 / (6 * 6)
= 20

2. Families with all girls:
Number of arrangements = 6! / (3! * 3!)
= 720 / (3! * 3!)
= 60

Since we've assumed an equal probability of boys and girls, we can estimate that half of the families with all boys will have order BBBBBB, and half of the families with all girls will have order B G B B B G.

Estimate for families with order B G B B B B:
= (Number of families with all boys * half) + (Number of families with all girls * half)
= (20 * 0.5) + (60 * 0.5)
= 10 + 30
= 40

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 40.
