I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather real-world data. However, I can help you understand how to reason about this problem based on the information provided.

The question states that there are 45 families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G (Girl, Boy, Girl, Boy, Boy, Girl). This order has 3 girls and 3 boys.

If we want to find out how many families have the order of births as B G B B B B (Boy, Girl, Boy, Boy, Boy, Girl), we can use the principle of counting indistinguishable permutations. In this case, the order of boys and girls within the boy group (B B B) does not matter, so we have 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the 3 boys. Similarly, the order of girls and boys within the girl group (G B G) does not matter, so we have 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange the 2 girls and 1 boy.

So, the total number of ways to arrange the boys and girls in the order B G B B B B is 3! * 2! = 6 * 2 = 12.

However, we need to consider that the order of the entire group of 6 children does not matter. So, we divide the total number of arrangements by the number of ways to arrange the 6 children in a row, which is 6! (6 factorial) = 720.

So, the number of families with the order of births as B G B B B B is 12 / 720 = 0.0166667 (approximately).

Since we cannot have a fraction of a family, this information is not meaningful in the context of this problem. It suggests that the actual number of families with this birth order is likely to be very small compared to the number of families with the G B G B B B G order. Without more data, it's not possible to provide a more precise estimate.
