I'm an AI and don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using probability concepts.

Assuming that the gender of a child is random (i.e., a boy or a girl has a 50% chance of being born), we can use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways to arrange 6 children with 3 boys and 3 girls, maintaining the specified order.

First, let's find the number of ways to arrange 3 boys and 3 girls in any order:

Total arrangements = Number of ways to arrange 6 children
                             = C(6, 6) = 6! / (3! * 3!)
                             = 720

Now, let's find the number of arrangements that meet the specified order:

Arrangements with B G B B B G = Number of ways to arrange 3 girls and 3 boys in the specified order
                                          = C(3, 3) * C(3, 3)
                                          = (3! / (3! * 0!)) * (3! / (2! * 1!))
                                          = 1 * 6
                                          = 6

So, there are 6 arrangements with the specified order. However, we don't know the exact number of families with 6 children that meet this order. To make an estimate, let's assume that the families with this order are a small fraction of all families with 6 children.

Since there were 45 families with the G B G B B G order and we've determined that there are 6 possible arrangements with the specified order, we can make an estimate as follows:

{answer: approximately 45/6 families with the order B G B B B B}

Again, this is an estimate based on the assumption that families with the specified order are a small fraction of all families with 6 children. Without actual data, we cannot provide a more precise answer.
