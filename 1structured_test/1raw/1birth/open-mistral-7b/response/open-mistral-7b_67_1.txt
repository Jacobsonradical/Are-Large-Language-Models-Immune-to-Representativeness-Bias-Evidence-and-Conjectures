I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you think about this problem logically.

The order of births you provided, G B G B B G, has 3 boys and 3 girls. Since the gender of a child doesn't affect its position in the birth order, the number of families with this exact order should be equal to the number of families with the opposite order of boys and girls, which is B G B G B G.

So, if there are 45 families with the first order, there should also be 45 families with the second order, assuming there are no other factors affecting the birth order. Therefore, your estimate would be:

{answer: 45}
