To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probabilities and the given information about families with the order G B G B B G.

First, let's note that the order of births is symmetric, meaning that the order B G B B B B is just the reverse order of G B G B B G. Therefore, the number of families with the order B G B B B B is equal to the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

The question gives us the number of families with the order G B G B B G: 45 families. Since the number of families with the order B G B B B B is the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that there are also 45 families with the order B G B B B B.

{answer: 45}
