I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

The question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. To find the number of families with this order, we subtract the number of families with the order G B G B B G from the total number of families with six children whose last birth was a boy (B).

The problem gives us the number of families with the order G B G B B G, which is 45. Since the order of boys and girls can be reversed, we can also consider this as the number of families with the order B G B G B G.

However, when counting the families with the order B G B B B B, we must account for families where the last birth was a girl, not a boy. So, we need to subtract the number of families with the order B G B B B G from the total number of families with six children whose last birth was a girl (G).

Unfortunately, the problem does not provide this information. As a result, it's not possible to provide an exact answer to this question based on the information given.
