I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using basic principles of combinatorics.

For a family of six children, there are a total of 720 different ways to arrange six boys (B) and girls (G) (6! = 720).

Let's consider the number of families where the exact order is B G B B B G. This arrangement can be thought of as having 5 positions for the girls and 1 position for the boy. So, the number of ways to arrange this specific order is 5! = 120.

Now, let's consider the number of families where the exact order is B G B B B B. This arrangement can be thought of as having 6 positions for boys. So, the number of ways to arrange this specific order is 6! = 720.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families where the exact order is B G B B B B. Since we don't have the total number of families surveyed, we can't provide an exact number. However, we can say that the number of families with this specific order is 720, based on the total number of ways to arrange six boys.

Therefore, your estimate would be:
{answer: 720 families}
