To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the information given does not allow for a direct calculation. Let's assume that the gender of a child is independent of the gender of the previous children. This means that the probability of having a boy or a girl in each birth is 0.5.

Given this assumption, the survey results suggest that the sequence G B G B B G has a probability of 0.03125 (1/32) of occurring by chance. On the other hand, the sequence B G B B B B has an equal probability of 0.03125.

Since both sequences are equally likely, assuming independence, we can estimate that there are as many families with the sequence B G B B B B as there are families with the sequence G B G B B G.

So, our estimate is:
{answer: 45 families} (assuming the same number of families for both sequences)
