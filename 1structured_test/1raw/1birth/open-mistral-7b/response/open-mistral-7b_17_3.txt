I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem theoretically.

The total number of permutations for six elements (boys or girls) is 6! (factorial), which equals 720. Since there are two types of elements (boys and girls), we can use the concept of multinomial coefficients to find the number of permutations where each type of element appears a certain number of times.

The multinomial coefficient C(n; r1, r2, ..., rk) is the number of ways to divide a set of n items into k non-empty subsets with r1 items in the first subset, r2 items in the second subset, and so on. In this case, n = 6 (total number of children), r1 = r2 = r3 = r4 = 1 (one boy or girl each), and r5 = r6 = 2 (two boys or girls each).

So, the number of permutations with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is given by C(6; 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2) = 15120.

However, we need to subtract the number of families with the exact order of births as G B G B B B, because these are considered as different permutations even though they represent the same family order (just with the gender labels switched).

We know there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G. So, the number of families with the order B G B B B B is 15120 - 45 = 15075.

So, your estimate would be:
