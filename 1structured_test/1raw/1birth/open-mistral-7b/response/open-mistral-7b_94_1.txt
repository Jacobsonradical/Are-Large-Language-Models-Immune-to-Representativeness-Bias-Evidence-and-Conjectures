I'm an AI and I don't have the capability to conduct real surveys or have real-time data. However, I can help you understand the problem and provide a logical approach to estimate the number of families.

In a family of six children, there are 7 possible ways to arrange them (6! divided by 2! for permutations of boys and girls, as the gender of each child is not relevant to the arrangement).

If the exact order of births is G B G B B G, that is one specific arrangement.

Now, let's consider the reverse arrangement B G B B B G. Since the order of births does not affect the child's identity, this is also a valid arrangement.

Therefore, for every family with the arrangement G B G B B G, there is another family with the arrangement B G B B B G. Since there are 45 families with the first arrangement, there should be approximately 45 families with the second arrangement.

So, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
