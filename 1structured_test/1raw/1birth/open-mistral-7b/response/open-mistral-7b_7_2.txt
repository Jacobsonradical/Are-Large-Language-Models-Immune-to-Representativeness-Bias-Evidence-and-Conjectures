I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or have real-time data. However, I can help you reason through this problem.

In a family of six children, there are several possible orders of births for boys (B) and girls (G). One of these orders is B G B B B B.

We know that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G. This means that in the other families, the order of births was not G B G B B G.

Since there are only a few possible orders of births, and many families must have one of these other orders, it's reasonable to estimate that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is less than 45.

However, without more specific information about the total number of families surveyed or the other possible orders of birth, I can't provide a more precise estimate.

So, your estimate could be:
{answer: less than 45}
