To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the information provided only gives us data for one specific order of births (G B G B B G). However, we can assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, which is a common assumption in demographics.

Let's consider the number of ways to arrange six items (boys and girls) in two groups: one group of boys and one group of girls. This is a combination problem, and the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items in one group, and "!" denotes factorial.

Given our assumption of equal probability of boys and girls, the odds of having more boys or more girls are the same. So, if we consider one group as boys and the other as girls, the number of families with this specific order (B G B B B G) should approximately equal the number of families with the reversed order (B B B B G B G).

First, let's find the number of ways to arrange six items into two groups of three and three. For the first group (boys), we have C(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20 ways. For the second group (girls), we have the same number of ways, C(6, 3) = 20 ways.

Now, to find the total number of ways to arrange these two groups, we multiply the number of ways for each group: 20 * 20 = 400 ways.

Since we assume that the number of families with the specific order (B G B B B G) should approximately equal the number of families with the reversed order (B B B B G B G), we can estimate the number of families with the reversed order to be 400 as well.

So, your estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B B B B G B G would be 400.
