To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the gender distribution in a family, as the question does not provide any information about it. A common assumption is that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5).

Let's consider the case where we have six boys (B B B B B B). This sequence doesn't match the given pattern, so we can rule it out.

Now, let's consider the case where we have five girls and one boy (G G G G G B). This sequence also doesn't match the given pattern, so we can rule it out.

The only remaining option is six girls followed by one boy (G G G G G B). The pattern G B G B B G matches the given pattern, so we've found one family with this pattern.

Since we've ruled out the other two possibilities, and there's only one option left that fits the pattern, it means that there must be exactly one family with the exact order of births B G B B B B. However, the question asks for an estimate, and given that we're making an assumption about gender distribution, it would be inappropriate to give an exact number.

Therefore, based on the assumption of equal probability for boys and girls, our estimate is that there is likely only one family with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

{answer: 1 (with an estimate of around 1, but the exact number is likely 1 due to the assumption) }
