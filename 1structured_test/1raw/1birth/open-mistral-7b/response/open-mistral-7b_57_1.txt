To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the data provided only gives information about families with the specific order G B G B B G. Without additional information, we cannot make a definitive calculation for the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the assumption that the gender of a child is random, meaning the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5). Given that there are two possible orders for boys and girls (B B G G G G and G G B B B B), and considering the equal probability of having a boy or a girl, we can estimate that there could be as many families with the order B G B B B B as there are with the order G B G B B G.

So, if there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that there might be 45 families with the order B G B B B B.

{answer: 45}
