To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the information provided does not allow us to calculate an exact number. One reasonable assumption could be that the gender distribution in births is relatively balanced, which means the probability of a boy or a girl being born is approximately 50%.

Given that there are six children in each family, the total number of permutations for six elements (two boys and four girls, or four boys and two girls) is 6! = 720.

The order we are interested in is B G B B B B, which is one of the 6! permutations for four boys and two girls. So, the total number of families with this exact order is 1 (since we have only one desired order).

However, the question asks for the number of families with the exact order of B G B B B B. Since the probability of having six boys is very low (0.015625), we can assume that all families with six boys were not included in the survey.

Therefore, the remaining families have to have at least one girl, and thus, the order B G B B B B is not possible.

Given this, it seems that the data provided does not allow us to estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.
