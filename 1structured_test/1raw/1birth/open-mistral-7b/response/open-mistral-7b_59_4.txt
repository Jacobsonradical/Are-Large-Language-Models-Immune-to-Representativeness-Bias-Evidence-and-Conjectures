To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the information provided does not allow for a precise calculation. Let's assume that the gender of a child is random, meaning the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5).

Given that the surveyed families all have six children, and we know the exact order of births for 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B by considering the opposite sequence (which would be the same sequence if we swap 'B' and 'G' everywhere).

Since the gender of a child is assumed to be random, the probability of having a sequence of six boys in a row should be the same as having six girls in a row. Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B to be the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G, which is 45 families.

{answer: 45 families}
