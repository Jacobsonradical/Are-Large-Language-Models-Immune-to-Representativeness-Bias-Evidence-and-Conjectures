To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probability and the fact that we know the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange six children (without considering gender). This can be done using combinations: C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items being chosen. In this case, n = 6 and r = 6, so C(6, 6) = 1.

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to arrange six children with exactly three boys and three girls. Since there are C(6, 3) ways to choose the three boys and C(6, 3) ways to choose the three girls, we can multiply these two values to get the total number of arrangements: C(6, 3) * C(6, 3) = 20 * 20 = 400.

However, we must account for the fact that we are only interested in the exact order of births. In this case, the order of the boys and girls does not matter, so we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 2! (since there are 2 ways to arrange the three boys and 2 ways to arrange the three girls): 400 / 2! = 400 / 2 = 200.

Now, let's assume that in the families with the order G B G B B G, the gender distribution is randomly distributed. This means that the probability of having a family with the order B G B B B B is equal to the probability of having a family with the order G B G B B G, which is 1/2 (since there are two orders).

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B is 1/2 * number of families with the order G B G B B G = 1/2 * 45 = {answer: 22.5}.

Since we cannot have half a family, this estimate is not precise. A more accurate estimate would require more data or additional assumptions about the gender distribution.
