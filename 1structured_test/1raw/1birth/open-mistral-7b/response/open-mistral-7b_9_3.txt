To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the gender ratio of children in families. A common assumption is a 50-50 ratio of boys and girls. However, since the order of births is given, we can't account for families with fewer than six children using this assumption.

Let's consider families with exactly six children first. In these families, the gender ratio can still be assumed to be 50-50. The order of births given is "Boy Girl Boy Girl Boy Girl," which can be rewritten as "B1 G1 B2 G2 B3 G3" where the numbers represent the positions in the family.

There are 6! (factorial) ways to arrange the six positions, which is 720. However, since the gender is fixed, we need to consider only the arrangements of the positions for each gender separately. There are 6! ways to arrange the positions for boys (B1, B2, B3) and 6! ways to arrange the positions for girls (G1, G2, G3).

Since the positions are different, we can multiply the number of arrangements for boys and girls to get the total number of arrangements for the given order of births: 720 * 720 = 518400 arrangements.

Now, let's make an assumption about the proportion of families with exactly six children. If we assume that all families have six children (which is not the case), then the number of families with the given order of births would be 518400.

Since we cannot assume that all families have six children, we need to make another assumption. If we assume that the proportion of families with exactly six children is the same as the proportion of arrangements with exactly six children in the total arrangement of all possible families, then the number of families with the given order of births would be the proportion of arrangements with exactly six children multiplied by the total number of families surveyed.

However, without knowing the total number of families surveyed or the actual proportion of families with exactly six children, we cannot provide a specific estimate. Therefore, the answer is:
{answer: cannot be determined with the given information}
