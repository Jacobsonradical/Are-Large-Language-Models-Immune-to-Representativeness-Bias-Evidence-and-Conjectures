I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

Given that there are 6 children in each family, their genders can be represented by the letters B (boy) and G (girl), and the order of birth can be represented by a sequence of these letters. In a family with 6 children and where the order of birth is B G B B B G, there are 2 boys and 4 girls.

If we assume that the gender of a child is random and independent of the gender of the other children, the probability of having a B followed by a G is 1/2 (for boy) times 1/2 (for girl) = 1/4. Since there are 2 such pairs in the sequence, the probability of having this exact order of births is (1/4)^2 * (1/2)^4 = 1/256.

Now, to estimate the number of families with this exact order, we need to multiply the probability by the total number of families surveyed. However, since the question only gives the number of families with the order G B G B B G, we can't provide a precise estimate. But if we assume that the number of families with this order is not significantly different from the number of families with the order B G B B B G, we can make an educated guess that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is about the same. Therefore, an estimate could be:

{answer: 45 families (since the question gave this number for the other order)}

Again, this is just an estimate based on the assumption that the number of families with different orders is similar. Without actual data, we can't provide a more precise answer.
