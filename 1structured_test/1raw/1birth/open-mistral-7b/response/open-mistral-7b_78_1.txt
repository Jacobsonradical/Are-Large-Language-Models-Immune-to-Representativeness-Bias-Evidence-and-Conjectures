To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of complementary probabilities. First, let's find the probability of a family having the order of births G B G B B G.

Since there are six children, the number of ways to arrange them is 6! (factorial). However, we are interested in the arrangement where there are exactly three girls and three boys. This can be calculated using combinations:

Number of arrangements with 3 girls and 3 boys = C(6, 3) * C(6, 3)

C(n, r) denotes the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items without considering the order.

Plugging in the values, we get:

Number of arrangements with 3 girls and 3 boys = (6! / (3! * 3!)) * (6! / (3! * 3!))
                                                                 = (720 / (6 * 6)) * (720 / (6 * 6))
                                                                 = 20 * 20
                                                                 = 400

Now, let's find the probability of a family having the order of births as B G B B B B. This can also be calculated using combinations:

Number of arrangements with 3 boys and 3 girls = C(6, 3) * C(6, 3)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Number of arrangements with 3 boys and 3 girls = (6! / (3! * 3!)) * (6! / (3! * 3!))
                                                                 = (720 / (6 * 6)) * (720 / (6 * 6))
                                                                 = 20 * 20
                                                                 = 400

The probability of a family having the order of births G B G B B G is the number of such arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:

P(G B G B B G) = 400 / 720
                     = 1 / 3

Now, we'll find the complementary probability, which is the probability of a family having the order of births B G B B B B:

P(B G B B B B B) = 1 - P(G B G B B G)
                        = 1 - (1/3)
                        = 2/3

To estimate the number of families with the order of births as B G B B B B, we can multiply the number of families surveyed (45) by the complementary probability:

{answer: 45 * (2/3) â‰ˆ 30}

So, our estimate is that there are approximately 30 families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B.
