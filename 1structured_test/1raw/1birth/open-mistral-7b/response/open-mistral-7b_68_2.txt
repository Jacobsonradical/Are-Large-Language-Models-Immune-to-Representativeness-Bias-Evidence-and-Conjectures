I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or analyze data from a specific city. However, I can help you understand the concept and provide an educated guess based on symmetry.

In this case, the order of births for boys (B) and girls (G) is given as G B G B B G. Since the genders don't matter for the purpose of symmetry, we can consider this as G1 B1 G2 B2 G3.

Now, if we swap every "G" with "B" and every "B" with "G", we get B1 G1 B2 G2 B3, which is the reverse order of the original. This means that for every family with the given order, there is another family with the reversed order.

So, if there are 45 families with the given order, then there should be approximately the same number of families with the reversed order. Therefore, your estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 45} (approximately, assuming an equal distribution of families with reversed order)
