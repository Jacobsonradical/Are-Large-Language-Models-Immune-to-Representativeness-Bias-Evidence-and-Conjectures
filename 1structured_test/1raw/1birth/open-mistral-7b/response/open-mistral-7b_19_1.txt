I'm an AI and don't have the ability to conduct surveys or gather real-world data. However, I can help you understand how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

Given that the question asks for an estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, and we know the number of families with the order G B G B B G, we can make an assumption.

Assuming that the gender of the first child being a boy or a girl is not relevant to the birth order frequency, we can consider both orders (G B G B B G and B G B B B G) as the same, as they both result in the same distribution of boys and girls in their birth order.

If there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, then we can estimate that there should be an equal number of families with the order B G B B B G. Therefore, your estimate would be:

{answer: 45 families}

Again, this is an assumption-based answer, as the question does not provide enough information to definitively say that the gender of the first child does not affect the birth order frequency.
