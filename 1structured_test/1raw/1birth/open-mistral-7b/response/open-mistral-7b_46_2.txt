I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect real-world data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem if you had the data.

Given that there are 6 children in each family, there are a total of 6! (6 factorial) = 720 possible orders of births for 6 children.

In the case of the question, we're looking for families with the order of births as B G B B B G. This is one specific permutation of those 6 children.

There are also another 6! permutations of the boys (B) and girls (G) that result in the same order of boys and girls but with the genders reversed, i.e., G B G B B B B. These 2 permutations account for all families with this specific gender distribution and order.

Now, we know that in 45 families, we found the order of G B G B B G. This means that there are 45 - 2 = 43 families where this order is reversed.

So, the total number of families with this specific gender distribution and the order of B G B B B B or B G B B B B G is 45 + 43 = 88 families.

However, you asked for an estimate, not an exact number. If the survey was not exhaustive or if some families were missed, the actual number of families with this specific order might be less than 88. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B B would still be around 88, but with some uncertainty due to the incomplete survey.

{answer: around 88 families}
