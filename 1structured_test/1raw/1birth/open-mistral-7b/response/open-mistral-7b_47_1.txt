I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using basic principles of combinatorics.

In a family with six children, there are two possibilities for the gender of the first child (boy or girl). For the second child, there are also two possibilities, but since the first child is already a boy or a girl, one of these possibilities is already filled. So, for the second child, there are only one "new" possibility (if the first child is a girl, then the second can be a boy; if the first child is a boy, then the second can't be a boy but can be a girl). This pattern continues for the third, fourth, and fifth children.

For the sixth child, since all five previous positions are filled, it can be of any gender without affecting the order.

So, the total number of ways to arrange B and G for six children, given that the order is fixed as B G B B B G, is 2 * 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 32.

However, in your question, you're asking for the number of families with the exact order of B and G as B G B B B B. So, the total number of families with this order is the number of ways to choose the six positions for the boys (B) from the six available positions, which is C(6, 4) = 15.

Since you mentioned that 45 families had the exact order of B and G as G B G B B G, the number of families with the exact order of B and G as B G B B B B is 45 - 15 = 30.

So, the answer to your question is {answer: 30}.
