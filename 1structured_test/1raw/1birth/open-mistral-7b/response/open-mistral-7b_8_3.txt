To answer this question, we first need to understand the probabilities of having boys (B) or girls (G) in a family, and then apply those probabilities to calculate the number of families with a specific birth order.

Let's assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is 0.5 (or 50%) each. This assumption is based on the belief that the gender of a child is not influenced by the gender of the previous child.

Now, let's consider the order of births for boys and girls in the question: G B G B B G. This means that there are 3 boys and 3 girls, and the boys are born before the girls in each pair.

To calculate the number of families with this exact birth order, we need to multiply the probabilities of having a boy (B) and a girl (G) in each position. The number of families with this specific birth order is then the product of these probabilities, raised to the power of the number of children (6):

{answer: (0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5) * (Number of families surveyed) = (0.0015625) * (Number of families surveyed)}

However, we don't know the exact number of families surveyed. We can only estimate this number based on the assumption that the gender of a child is not influenced by the gender of the previous child.

In the given question, we know that there are 45 families with the exact order of births of boys as G B G B B G. To find the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use this information to find the constant in our equation.

We know that:

Number of families with G B G B B G = (0.0015625) * (Number of families surveyed)

Since there are 45 families with the order as G B G B B G, we can write:

45 = (0.0015625) * (Number of families surveyed)

Now, we can solve for the number of families surveyed:

Number of families surveyed = 45 / 0.0015625 ≈ 28,982.13

However, the number of families surveyed must be a whole number. Since the number we obtained is not a whole number, it means that our assumption about the gender probability being 50% might not be accurate. It's possible that the gender of a child can influence the gender of the next child.

To obtain a whole number for the number of families surveyed, we can consider that the probability of having a boy or a girl is slightly different from 50%. For example, we can assume that the probability of having a boy is 0.51 (or 51%) and the probability of having a girl is 0.49 (or 49%).

With this assumption, we can calculate the number of families with the exact birth order as B G B B B B:

Number of families with B G B B B B = (0.51 * 0.49 * 0.51 * 0.49 * 0.51 * 0.49) * (Number of families surveyed)

Now, we can solve for the number of families surveyed:

Number of families surveyed = (0.51 * 0.49 * 0.51 * 0.49 * 0.51 * 0.49) / (0.0015625) ≈ 28,982

This number is a whole number, and it represents our best estimate of the number of families surveyed with the exact birth order of B G B B B B. However, it's important to note that this estimate is based on an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl
