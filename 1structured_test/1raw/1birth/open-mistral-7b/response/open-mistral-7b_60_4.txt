To answer this question, we cannot provide an exact number based on the given information. The reason is that the survey only provides data on families with the specific order of births G B G B B G. It does not provide any information about families with other orders of birth, such as B G B B B B or any other order. Therefore, it's not possible to make an estimate or draw any conclusions about the frequency of these other orders without more data.

However, if you're looking for an estimate based on the assumption that the order of births is random and there's no preference for one gender over the other, then the probability of having six boys or six girls in a row would be very low. In such a case, we could say that the number of families with this order is likely to be relatively small compared to families with the order G B G B B G. But again, this is just an assumption and without more data, we cannot provide a precise estimate.
