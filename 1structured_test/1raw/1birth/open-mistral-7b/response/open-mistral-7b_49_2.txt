I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

In this case, we're looking for families with the exact order of births as Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy. The number of ways to arrange these six elements (B's and G's) in this specific order is 6! (factorial) divided by the number of ways to arrange the 3 B's and 3 G's separately, which is (3! * 3!) because order matters for boys and girls in this case.

So, the number of families with the order B G B B B G is 6! / (3! * 3!) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 20 families.

However, since we know that 45 families have the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that there might be 20 - 45 = -25 fewer families with the order B G B B B G. But since the number of families cannot be negative, it's more appropriate to say that the exact number of families with the order B G B B B G is unknown, and we can only say that it's less than 20 based on the given information.

So, my estimate would be:
{answer: less than 20 families}
