This is a probability problem, and we don't have enough information to provide an exact number. However, we can make an estimate based on symmetry.

In the given order of births, there are 3 boys and 3 girls. Since the order of births is important, we're looking for families with 3 boys and 3 girls in a specific order.

Now, there are 6! (factorial) ways to arrange 6 children. Since the genders are fixed (3 boys and 3 girls), we can divide this total number of arrangements by the number of ways to arrange 3 boys and 3 girls separately (3! for boys and 3! for girls).

However, in the given order (G B G B B G), the girls are always in the even positions, and the boys are always in the odd positions. This means that if we arrange the boys first, the girls will automatically be in the even positions. So, the number of ways to arrange the boys (3!) times the number of ways to arrange the girls within those positions (also 3!) should give us the number of arrangements with the given order.

Thus, the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B would be (3! * 3!).

Unfortunately, we don't know how many families were surveyed in total, so we can't provide an estimate of the number of such families from this data. The given information only allows us to find the number of families with the specific order of births B G B B B G, not their proportion in the total number of surveyed families.
