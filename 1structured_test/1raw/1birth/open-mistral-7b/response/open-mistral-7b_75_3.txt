I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families surveyed where the exact order of births was Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Boy. Since the total number of families with the exact order of Boy Girl Girl Boy Boy Boy was not provided, we cannot provide a precise number.

However, we do know that 45 families had the exact order of Boy Girl Girl Boy Boy Boy Girl. This means that there must be an equal number of families with the exact order of Boy Girl Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl, as the gender of the first child does not affect the count of families with the specified second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth birth orders.

So, your estimate would be that there are approximately 45 families with the order of Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Boy Boy. This is because if half of the families with the first order switched to the second order, the total number of families with this exact birth order would remain the same (45 families).
