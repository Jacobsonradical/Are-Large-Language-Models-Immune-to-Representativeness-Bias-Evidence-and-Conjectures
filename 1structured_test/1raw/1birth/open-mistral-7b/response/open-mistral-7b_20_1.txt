I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy (B) Boy (B) Girl (G). Since the gender of the first child is not specified, we can assume that there are twice as many families with BGBBBG as there are with GBGBGB.

So, if there are 45 families with BGBBBG, then there would be approximately 45 * 2 = {answer: 90} families with GBGBGB.
