To answer this question, we will make an assumption based on the available information. Since we know that in 45 families, the order of birth was G B G B B G, we can infer that the order of boys and girls is not necessarily fixed and can vary.

However, without any additional information about the gender ratio or birth order preferences in the population, it's not possible to provide an exact number of families with the order B G B B B B. Therefore, I will provide an estimate based on the assumption of equal probability for all permutations of boy and girl birth orders.

There are 6! (720) possible permutations for the order of 6 children. Half of these permutations will have an even number of boys, and half will have an odd number of boys. Since we're interested in the order B G B B B B, which has an even number of boys, there should be 720/2 = 360 such permutations.

However, it's important to note that this is an assumption based on the assumption of equal probability for all permutations, which may not be accurate in a real-world scenario. To get a more accurate estimate, data on gender ratios and birth order preferences in the population would be needed.

{answer: approximately 360 families}
