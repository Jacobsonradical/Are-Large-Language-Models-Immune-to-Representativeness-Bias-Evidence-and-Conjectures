I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can use logic to help answer your question.

The question states that the exact order of births of boys (B) and girls was G B G B B G in 45 families. Since the genders of the children are alternating (G for girl, B for boy), we can think of this as a pattern of two distinct elements (G or B).

If we assume that there are two types of families: those with the pattern G B G B B G and those with the pattern B G B B B B G, then we know that there are 45 families with the first pattern.

To find the number of families with the second pattern (B G B B B B G), we need to consider that each family with the first pattern has a complementary family with the second pattern. In other words, for every family with the first pattern, there is one less family with the second pattern (since one position in the pattern is filled twice).

So, the number of families with the second pattern is the total number of families minus the number of families with the first pattern.

Therefore, your estimate should be:

{answer: 45 families - 45 families = 0 families}

However, this answer doesn't make sense in the context of the question, which asks for the number of families with the second pattern. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the question or the way it's worded. I would recommend checking the question again to see if there's any missing information or if the numbers provided don't add up.
