To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. First, let's find the number of families with at least one boy and then subtract the number of families with the specific order of boys G B G B B G.

1. The total number of families with at least one boy is C(n, k) = C(6, 1) * C(5, 5) = 6 * 120 = 720 (where n = 6 is the total number of children and k = 1 is the minimum number of boys).
2. The number of families with exactly 6 boys is C(6, 6) = 1.
3. The number of families with exactly 5 boys and 1 girl is C(6, 5) * C(1, 1) = 6 * 1 = 6.
4. The number of families with exactly 4 boys and 2 girls is C(6, 4) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 1 = 15.
5. The number of families with exactly 3 boys and 3 girls is C(6, 3) * C(3, 3) = 20 * 6 = 120.

Now, let's find the number of families with the specific order of boys G B G B B G:

1. The first girl can only be born in the 6th position.
2. The second girl can only be born in any of the 5 positions before the first boy (B).
3. Similarly, the third girl can be born in any of the 4 positions before the second boy (B).
4. The fourth girl can be born in any of the 3 positions before the third boy (B).
5. The fifth girl can be born in any of the 2 positions before the fourth boy (B).

So, the number of families with the specific order of boys G B G B B G is:
C(5, 1) * C(4, 1) * C(3, 1) * C(2, 1) * C(1, 1) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:

Total families with at least one boy - Families with specific order of boys
720 - 120 = {answer: 600} families.
