I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help explain the concept and provide a theoretical answer based on symmetry.

Given that the question is about families with six children, the number of possible gender combinations is C(6, 3) = 20 (since there are 3 ways to choose 3 positions for girls among 6 positions overall).

One of these combinations is B G B B B B, which is the one you're not interested in. The remaining 19 combinations are all symmetrical to this one (for example, B G B G B B, B B G B G B, etc.).

Since the order of births doesn't matter for the girls in these symmetrical combinations, we can assume that each of the 19 symmetrical combinations corresponds to the same family situation. Therefore, if we find that one of these combinations was observed in 45 families, we can estimate that all 19 symmetrical combinations were observed a total of 45 * 19 = 885 times.

However, since we're only interested in the specific combination B G B B B B, we need to divide the total by 19 to get an estimate for the number of families with this exact order of births.

So, the answer to your question would be:
{answer: 45 families / 19 â‰ˆ 2.37 families}

This estimate suggests that the exact order of births B G B B B B was observed in approximately 2 families in addition to the 45 families with the observed order G B G B B G. However, since we can't have a fraction of a family, this result is not meaningful in a practical sense. It's important to note that this estimation assumes that all gender combinations are equally likely, which may not always be the case in real-world situations.
