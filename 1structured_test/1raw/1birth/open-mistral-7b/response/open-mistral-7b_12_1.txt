I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or analyze data. However, I can provide an approach to estimate the number of families with a specific birth order.

In this case, we're looking for families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B. Since there are 6 positions and 2 genders (B for boy and G for girl), the total number of ways to arrange 6 items (children) is given by the formula for permutations: n!, where n is the number of items. In this case, n = 6.

For the order G B G B B G, the number of ways to arrange 6 items is 6!, which equals 720.

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to arrange 6 items with 3 boys (B) and 3 girls (G). Since there are 3! ways to arrange 3 boys and 3! ways to arrange 3 girls, the total number of ways to arrange 6 items with 3B and 3G is 3! * 3! = 6 * 6 = 36 ways.

Therefore, the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is estimated to be the total number of families with the desired birth order divided by the number of ways to arrange 6 items with 3B and 3G.

So, the estimate would be:
{answer: 720 families with the desired birth order / 36 ways to arrange 3B and 3G} = {answer: 20 families}
