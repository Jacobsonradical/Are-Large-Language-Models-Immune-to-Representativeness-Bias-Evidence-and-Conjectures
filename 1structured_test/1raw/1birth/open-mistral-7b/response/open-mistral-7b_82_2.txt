I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or observe real-world data. However, I can help you understand the concept and provide an estimate based on certain assumptions.

The exact order of births of boys (B) and girls (G) for six children can be represented as BBGGBB, BGGBBB, BBBGBB, BBBBGB, BBBBGG, and BGGGBB (six permutations, since order matters).

Given that 45 families have the order G B G B B G, the number of families with the order B G B B B B would be the number of families with the order G B G B B B minus the number of families with the order G B G B B B that have been counted under G B G B B G (since the last two children are the same in both orders).

Let's denote the total number of families surveyed as N. The number of families with the order G B G B B B is the same as the number of families with the order B G B B B B, and they can be calculated as N/6 (since there are 6!/2! ways to arrange 6 children into two groups of 3, and half of them will have boys first).

So, the number of families with the order G B G B B B is N/6, and the number of families with the order G B G B B B that have been counted under G B G B B G is 45.

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B is N/6 - 45. Since I don't have the value of N, I can't provide a specific number, but the estimate is proportional to N/6 - 45.
