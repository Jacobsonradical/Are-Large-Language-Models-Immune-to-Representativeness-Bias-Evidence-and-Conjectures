I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or have real-time data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, you can use the concept of permutations. In this case, you're looking for the number of ways to arrange 6 positions (for the 6 children) with 2 B's and 4 G's.

The total number of ways to arrange 6 items is 6! (6 factorial), which is 720.

The number of ways to arrange 2 B's and 4 G's in 6 positions is given by the formula for combinations: C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.

So, C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15 ways to arrange 2 B's and 4 G's.

Therefore, the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B would be the total number of families minus the number of families with the order G B G B B G, which is also 15.

Since we don't have the total number of families surveyed, I can't give you an exact number. However, if we assume that the total number of families is close to the number of ways to arrange 6 items (720), then your estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B would be 720 - 15 = 705.

{answer: approximately 705 families}
