I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

In a family of six children, there are 6! (factorial) or 720 different ways to arrange the order of births (B for boy, G for girl). Among these, we're interested in two specific arrangements: BGGBBB and GBGBGB.

To find the number of families with the arrangement BGGBBB, we need to find the number of ways to arrange 5 girls and 1 boy in 6 positions, which is given by 6! / (5! * 1!) = 720 / (120 * 1) = 6 ways.

Similarly, for the arrangement GBGBGB, we need to find the number of ways to arrange 4 girls and 2 boys in 6 positions, which is given by 6! / (4! * 2!) = 720 / (24 * 2) = 15 ways.

So, if we assume that the two arrangements are equally likely (which is not necessarily true in real life), the estimated number of families with the arrangement B G B B B B would be half the number of families with the arrangement G B G B B B, which is 6 * 0.5 = {answer: 3}.

However, this is just an estimate based on the assumption that the arrangements are equally likely. In real life, the actual number may be higher or lower.
