I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using combinatorics.

The order of six births can be thought of as arranging six objects (B for boy and G for girl) in six positions. The exact order of births you're interested in is B G B B B B.

The number of ways to arrange six objects in six positions is given by the factorial of 6, which is 6!. This means there are 720 possible arrangements.

The number of ways to arrange six boys and girls in the order B G B B B B is the number of ways to choose 6 positions for the 3 boys and 3 positions for the 3 girls, multiplying the number of ways to arrange the boys in those 6 positions by the number of ways to arrange the girls in the remaining 6 positions.

This can be calculated as C(6,3) * C(6,3) * 3! * 3!, where C(n,r) represents the number of combinations of choosing r items from a set of n items.

However, since the positions of the boys and girls are interchangeable, we need to divide this number by 2! to account for this symmetry.

So, the number of families with the order B G B B B B is (6 choose 3) * (6 choose 3) * 6! * 6! / 2! = 20,160.

But we're given that there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G. This means there are 20,160 - 45 families with the order B G B B B B.

So, your estimate would be:
{answer: 20,115} (since I'm an AI, I can't provide an exact count, but I can tell you that the estimate is 20,115 families)
