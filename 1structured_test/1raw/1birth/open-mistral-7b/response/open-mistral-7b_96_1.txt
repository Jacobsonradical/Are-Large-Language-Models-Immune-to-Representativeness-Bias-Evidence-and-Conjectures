I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem if you were to collect the data yourself.

In this case, we're trying to find out how many families have six children with the exact order of births as Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy.

To estimate this, we could consider the number of ways to arrange six distinct objects (boys and girls) into two groups of three (two boys and three girls or three boys and three girls). This is a combination problem, which can be calculated using the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of objects and k is the number of objects in each group.

First, let's find the number of ways to arrange six objects into two groups of three. This would be C(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20 ways.

However, we need to account for the fact that the order of boys and girls within each group doesn't matter. So, for each arrangement of three boys and three girls, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the boys and 3! = 6 ways to arrange the girls.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange six children with two groups of three is 20 * 6 * 6 = 720.

However, we need to subtract the cases where the order of births is B G B G B G, which we know is 45 families. So, the number of families with the order of births as B G B B B B would be 720 - 45 = 675.

So, your estimate would be:
{answer: 675}
