I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can provide an answer based on the information given and some logical reasoning.

The question states that there are 45 families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G (Girl, Boy, Girl, Boy, Boy, Girl). This means there are 5 boys and 1 girl in each of these families.

If we want to find out how many families have the exact order of births as B G B B B B (Boy, Girl, Boy, Boy, Boy, Girl), we can assume that the gender of the children is randomly distributed and the order of birth is also random, as long as the boy-girl ratio is maintained (in this case, 5 boys to 1 girl).

Since the order of birth doesn't matter in this context (only the ratio does), the number of families with the exact order of B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the order of G B G B B B G, which we know is 45.

So, my estimate would be:
{answer: 45}

Again, this is just an estimate based on the assumption that the gender distribution and order of birth are random. The actual number could be different if the survey results deviate from this assumption.
