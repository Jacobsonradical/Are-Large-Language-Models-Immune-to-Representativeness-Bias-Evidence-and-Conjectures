I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using basic principles of combinatorics.

In a family of six children, there are two types of orders: those starting with a boy (B) and those starting with a girl (G).

For a family starting with a boy (B G B B B G), there are 5 positions for the three girls to be born. So, the number of families with this order is C(6, 3) = 20.

Similarly, for a family starting with a girl (G B B B B G), there are 5 positions for the three boys to be born. So, the number of families with this order is also C(6, 3) = 20.

Since the question asks for the total number of families with exactly six children, we should double the number of families with the order G B B B B G because each family is being counted twice (once for each starting position).

So, your estimate would be:
{answer: 2 * 20 = 40 families}

However, the survey data mentioned only families with the order G B G B B G. It would be helpful to have more information to make a more precise estimate. For example, knowing the total number of families surveyed or the proportion of families with a certain order of births could allow for a more accurate calculation.
