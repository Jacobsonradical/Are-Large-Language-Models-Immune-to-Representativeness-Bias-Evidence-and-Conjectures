I'm an AI, and I don't have real-time data or the ability to conduct surveys. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families where the exact order of births is Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. We know there are 45 families with the order Boy Girl Girl Boy Boy Girl.

To find an estimate for the opposite order, we could assume that the gender of a baby does not depend on the gender of the previous babies. Therefore, we could estimate that the number of families with the order Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl Boy Girl is also 45.

However, since there are only two possible orders for six children (either all boys or all girls first, followed by the other gender), the total number of families with these two orders should add up to the total number of families surveyed.

So, if there are 45 families with one order, and 45 families with the opposite order, there would be 90 families in total. However, the question does not provide the total number of families surveyed, so I can't give a precise answer.

Therefore, the answer is: {answer: approximately 45 families, assuming equal distribution of gender orders in the population} (with the understanding that this is an estimate based on the assumption that gender distribution does not affect birth order.)
