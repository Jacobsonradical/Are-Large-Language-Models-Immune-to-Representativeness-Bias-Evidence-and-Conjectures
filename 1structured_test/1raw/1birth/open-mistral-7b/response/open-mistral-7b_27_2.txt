To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the information provided does not allow for a definitive answer. We can assume that the number of boys and girls in a family follows a binomial distribution, where the probability of having a boy or a girl is the same (as the question does not suggest otherwise).

However, the question asks for the exact order of births, which means we cannot assume that the order of boys and girls is randomly distributed. The given order G B G B B G suggests a pattern, and it's unlikely that this specific pattern occurs more frequently than random orderings.

Given these limitations, a reasonable estimate would be that the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B is less than the number of families with the exact order G B G B B G. However, without further information, it's impossible to provide a precise number.

Therefore, {answer: less than 45 families} is a reasonable estimate.
