To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations. In this case, we are arranging 6 positions (for the 6 children) with 2 types of elements (Boys and Girls), with 3 boys and 3 girls.

The total number of ways to arrange 6 elements with 2 types is given by the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of elements and k is the number of elements of one type. In our case, n = 6 and k = 2 (Boys and Girls).

However, since the gender of each child is fixed (3 boys and 3 girls), we are actually looking for arrangements without repetition, which is given by the formula for permutations: P(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!).

So, the total number of ways to arrange 6 children with 3 boys and 3 girls is P(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 720 / (2 * 24) = 15.

We know that in 45 families, the order was G B G B B G. Since we are looking for the opposite order (B G B B B B), we can subtract the number of families with the G B G B B B G order from the total number of possible orders, and then divide by 2 to account for the fact that each arrangement is counted twice (once for each order).

So, the number of families with the B G B B B B G order is 15 - 45 / 2 = 15 - 22.5 â‰ˆ 12.5, which means there are about 12 families with this order of births.

However, since the number of families cannot be a fraction, we should round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, our estimate is that there are 12 families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B.
