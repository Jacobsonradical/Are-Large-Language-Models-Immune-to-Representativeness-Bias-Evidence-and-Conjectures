I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or directly observe data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

The question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. Since we know the number of families with the order Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the reverse order.

Assuming that the gender of a child is random and independent of the gender of their siblings (a common assumption in probability), the number of families with the reverse order would be equal to the number of families with the original order.

So, if there were 45 families with the order B G B B B G, then your estimate for the number of families with the reverse order B B G G B G B would be {answer: 45}.

However, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the assumption of gender independence. In reality, there may be factors affecting the gender distribution within families that are not accounted for in this simple model. Therefore, this estimate should be considered as an approximation.
