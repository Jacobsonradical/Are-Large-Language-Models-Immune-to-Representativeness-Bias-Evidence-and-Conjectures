I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using combinatorics.

In a family with 6 children, there are 2 possible genders for each child: Boy (B) or Girl (G). The number of ways to arrange 6 items (children) in a specific order is given by the factorial function, which counts the number of arrangements without considering the order of identical items. For example, BBGGG and BBBGGG are considered the same arrangement of 6 boys and girls.

To find the number of families with 6 children where the exact order of births is B G B B B G, we need to consider the order of the boys and girls separately. First, let's find the number of ways to arrange the 5 non-identical items (4 boys and 1 girl). This can be done using the factorial function: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Now, we need to account for the fact that the boy and girl must be in specific positions within this arrangement. The boy can be in any of the first 5 positions, and the girl must be in the 6th position. So, the number of arrangements with this gender order is the number of ways to choose 1 position from the first 5 positions for the boy, which is given by the binomial coefficient: C(5, 1) = 5.

Multiplying the number of arrangements for the non-identical items with the number of ways to choose the position for the boy gives us the total number of arrangements with this gender order: 120 × 5 = 600.

However, we need to account for the fact that the exact order of births B G B B B G is one of the 6! = 720 possible orders, and not all of them represent distinct families. The order B G B B B G is already accounted for in the 600 arrangements we found earlier, so we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the boy and girl are in different orders but have the same gender distribution, which is given by the number of ways to choose 2 positions from the first 5 positions for the boys: C(5, 2) = 10.

There are 10 distinct arrangements with the same gender distribution but different orders, such as B G B B B G, B GB B B G, B G B B G B, and so on. Subtracting these arrangements from the total number of arrangements with this gender order leaves us with 600 - 10 = 590 distinct families with this gender order.

Since we started with a survey of 45 families with this exact gender order, our estimate of the number of families with this order in the entire city would be 590. However, without more information about the size of the city or the distribution of family sizes, this estimate is not precise.
