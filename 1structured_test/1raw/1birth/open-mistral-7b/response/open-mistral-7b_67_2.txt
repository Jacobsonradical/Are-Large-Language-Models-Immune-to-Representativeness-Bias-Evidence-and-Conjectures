To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the exact number of families with this specific birth order (B G B B B B) is not provided in the information given. A common assumption in such cases is that the birth order is randomly distributed, and the gender of the child does not affect the probability of the next birth being a boy or a girl.

If we assume this, then the probability of having six boys in a row (B B B B B B) is very low, and the probability of having six girls in a row (G G G G G G) is also low. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the families have a mix of boys and girls.

Considering that the exact order of births of boys and girls was G B G B B G in 45 families, it means that the order B G is less likely to occur. So, it's plausible that the order B G B B B B is less common than G B G B B G.

Therefore, based on this assumption, it's likely that there are fewer families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B. However, without more specific information, it's not possible to provide an exact number.

{answer: Fewer than 45 families, but the exact number cannot be determined with the given information}
