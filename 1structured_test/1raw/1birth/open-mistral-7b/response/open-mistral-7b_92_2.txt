To answer this question, we need to make an assumption as there is not enough information given to make a precise calculation. Let's assume that the gender of a child is random and independent of the genders of the siblings (which is often the case in real life).

In a family of six children, there are two possible orders for all boys (BBBBBB) and all girls (GGGGGG). We know that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G. That means there are 45 families with one specific order.

Now, let's consider the opposite order, B G B B B G. Since the genders are assumed to be independent, the probability of this order should be the same as the order we know (G B G B B G), assuming the same number of boys and girls.

Therefore, if we multiply the number of families with the specific order (45) by 2 (for considering both orders), we can estimate the number of families with the opposite order:

{answer: 90 (estimate)}

This estimate assumes that the gender of a child is random and independent, which is often the case in real life but not always.
