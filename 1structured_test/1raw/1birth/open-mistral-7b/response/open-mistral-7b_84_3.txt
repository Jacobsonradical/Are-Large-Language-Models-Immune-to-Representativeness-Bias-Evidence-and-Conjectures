I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this estimate.

The number of ways to arrange six objects (boys or girls) into a row is given by the factorial function, denoted as n!. In this case, there are 6! ways to arrange 6 children.

We're interested in the number of arrangements with a specific order: B G B B B B or BGBBBB. This is a permutation with a fixed number of Boys (B) and Girls (G), which can be calculated using the concept of multinomial coefficients.

However, since we don't have the number of boys and girls in the total population, we can't provide an exact number. If we assume an equal number of boys and girls, we can estimate that half of the families would have the arrangement B G B B B B and the other half would have the arrangement G B G B B G.

So, if the total number of families surveyed is 45, this estimate would be 45/2 = 22.5 families. Since we can't have half a family, this is not a valid answer in the context of this question. This is a limitation of the information provided and the assumption of an equal number of boys and girls.

Without more information, it's not possible to provide a more precise estimate.
