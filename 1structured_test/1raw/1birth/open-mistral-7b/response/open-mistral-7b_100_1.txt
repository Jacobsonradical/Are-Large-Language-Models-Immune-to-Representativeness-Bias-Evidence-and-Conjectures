I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem to make an estimate.

In this case, you're looking for families with six children where the order of births is Boy-Girl-Boy-Boy-Boy-Boy. Let's consider the first position (position 1) as a Boy (B). Then, the remaining five positions can have any combination of Boys (B) and Girls (G), but since we want a total of 3 Boys and 2 Girls, the possible combinations are BBBGG, BBGGG, BBGGBB, BGGGBB, and GBBBBB.

There are 5 choices for the position of the first Girl (position 2), and 4 choices for the position of the second Girl (position 4). For the remaining positions (position 3, 5, and 6), since there are 3 Boys left and we've already placed 2 of them, there are only 1 choice left for the position 3, 2 choices left for the position 5, and 3 choices left for the position 6.

So, the total number of combinations is 5 * 4 * 1 * 2 * 3 = 360.

However, the initial problem stated that the exact order of births was G B G B B G in 45 families. Since there are 6! (720) ways to arrange 6 children, and the order B G B B B B is only one of them, the actual number of families with 6 children should be 720.

Therefore, the number of families you're looking for should be 360 (the number of families with the specific order B G B B B B) divided by the number of ways to arrange 6 children (720), multiplied by 100 to get a percentage:

{answer: 360/720 * 100 â‰ˆ 50%}

This estimate suggests that about half of the families surveyed had the exact order of births as Boy-Girl-Boy-Boy-Boy-Boy.
