To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations and some reasoning.

First, let's consider the total number of ways to arrange six children without considering gender. This is known as a permutation of six items, which can be calculated as 6! (factorial), which equals 720.

Now, let's consider the families with exactly two boys and four girls (B B G G G G). There are C(6, 2) ways to choose the positions of the two boys, which equals 15. Then, for each of these arrangements, there are 6! ways to arrange the girls, so the total number of arrangements for this gender pattern is 15 * 720 = 10,800.

Now, let's consider the families with exactly three boys and three girls (B B B G G G). There are C(6, 3) ways to choose the positions of the three boys, which equals 20. Then, for each of these arrangements, there are 6! ways to arrange the girls, so the total number of arrangements for this gender pattern is 20 * 720 = 14,400.

Adding the number of arrangements for both gender patterns, we get 10,800 + 14,400 = 25,200.

However, when calculating the number of families with G B G B B B, we have double-counted the families with B G B B B G. Since there are C(6, 5) ways to choose the positions of the five girls in G B G B B B, which equals 120, and each of these has 2 ways of rearranging the boys, the actual number of families with G B G B B B is 120 * 2 = 240.

Subtracting the double-counted families from the total, we get 25,200 - 240 = 24,960.

To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can assume that the gender distribution is approximately equal in the surveyed families. Since the ratio of families with G B G B B B to the total families is 240/24,960, we can estimate that about 1% of the families have this exact order of births.

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:

{answer: 0.01 * total families surveyed}
