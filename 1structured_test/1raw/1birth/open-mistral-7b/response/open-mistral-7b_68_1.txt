To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of complementary probability. We know that there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, so the number of families with the opposite order (B G B B B B) would be the complement of this percentage.

First, let's find the probability of having a boy first (B) in the family with six children: P(B) = 1/2. Since the order we're interested in is B G B B B B, the probability of having a girl after the first boy (B) is also 1/2.

Now, let's calculate the probability of having the first four children as boys (B B B B) and the last two as girls (G G). The probability of this event is (1/2)^4 * (1/2)^2 = 1/64.

Since the order we're looking for is B G B B B B, the probability of having a boy after the first four boys (B B B B) is 1/2. The probability of having the last two children as girls (G G) under this condition is also 1/2.

Therefore, the probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B is (1/2) * (1/64) * (1/2)^2 = 1/512.

Now, to find the estimated number of families with this order, we can multiply the total number of families with the probability of having this order:

{answer: 45 families * 1/512 â‰ˆ 0.088}

Since the number of families must be an integer, we can round up to 1 family or simply assume that there is at least 1 family with this exact birth order. Therefore, our estimate is:
