I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or observe data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl, which we can denote as B G B B B G.

Since each child can be either a boy or a girl, there are 2 possibilities for the first child, 2 for the second, and so on, so there are 2^6 = 64 possible orders of births for 6 children.

However, there are some orders that are not possible because they have more boys than girls or vice versa. In this case, the order B G B B B G is possible because there are 3 boys and 3 girls.

Therefore, to estimate the number of families with this specific order of births, you can divide the total number of possible orders by the number of orders that are not possible, which have more boys or more girls than your target order.

Unfortunately, without more information about the gender ratio in the families, I can't give a specific estimate for the number of families with this order of births. You would need to know the gender ratio to calculate the number of non-possible orders.
