I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl, which we will denote as B G B B B G.

Let's consider the total number of ways to arrange 6 children, which is the factorial of 6 (6!). Now, let's consider the number of ways to arrange the children in the order B G B B B G. This can be done by first choosing the position of the first girl (which can be done in 5 places), then choosing the position of the first boy after the girl (which can be done in 4 places), and so on. So, the number of arrangements in the desired order is 5C1 * 4C1 * 3C1 * 2C1 * 1C1 = 5! * 4!.

To find the number of families with an opposite order (G B G B B B G), we can reason in a similar way: first choose the position of the first boy (5 choices), then choose the position of the first girl after the boy (4 choices), and so on. So, the number of arrangements in this opposite order is 5C1 * 4C1 * 3C1 * 2C1 * 1C1 = 5! * 4!.

Since there are two equally likely arrangements, the probability of either arrangement is 0.5. Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B G is 0.5 times the total number of families with 6 children, which is the estimated number of families with the opposite order, G B G B B B G.

So, your estimate could be:
{answer: 0.5 * number_of_families_with_6_children}
