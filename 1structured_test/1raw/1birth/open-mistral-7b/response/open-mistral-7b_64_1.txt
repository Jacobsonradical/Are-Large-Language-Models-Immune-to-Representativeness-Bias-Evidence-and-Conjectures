To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the survey data only provides information about families with the order of births as G B G B B G. Without additional data, it's not possible to calculate the exact number of families with the order of boys first (B G B B B B).

However, we can make an educated guess based on the assumption of equal probability of boys and girls being born first. If we assume this to be true, then the survey data suggests that girls are more likely to be born first (45 families with G B G B B G). If we assume that boys and girls have an equal chance of being born first, then there should be an equal number of families with B G B B B B.

So, our estimate would be that there are approximately 45 families with the order of births as B G B B B B.

{answer: 45 families}
