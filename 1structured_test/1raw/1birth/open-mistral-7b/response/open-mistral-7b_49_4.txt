I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to think about this problem.

The question asks for the number of families with six children where the exact order of births is Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. Let's call this number X.

Now, we know the number of families with six children and the exact order of births as Girls Boy Girls Boy Boys is 45. Let's call this number Y.

Since the order of births only matters in relation to each other, not absolute positions, we can assume that every time we swap a B and a G in the order G B G B B G, we get a new order that corresponds to a different family. There are 5 swaps to be made in the order G B G B B G, so there are 5! (5 factorial) = 120 possible orders after swapping.

If we subtract the number of families with the order B G B B B G from the total possible orders, we should be left with the number of families with the order B G B B B G after swapping.

So, the equation to solve is:

120 = X + Y

where X is the number of families with the order B G B B B G, and Y is the number of families with the order G B G B B B G (which we know is 45).

Solving for X, we get:

X = 120 - 45 = 75

So, my estimate based on the information given would be that there are 75 families with the exact order of births as Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl Girl.
