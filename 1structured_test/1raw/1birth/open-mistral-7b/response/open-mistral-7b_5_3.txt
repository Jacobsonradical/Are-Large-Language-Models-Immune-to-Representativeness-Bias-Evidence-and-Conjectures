I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to directly collect or analyze data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy.

Since we know the number of families with the order G B G B B G, we can assume that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is equal to the number of families with the order G B G B B G, but with the 'G' and 'B' switched for each family.

Therefore, if there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that there are also 45 families with the order B G B B B B G.

So, the estimate would be:
{answer: 45}
