I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for the number of families with all boys or all girls in the order B G B B B B (where B represents a boy and G represents a girl). Since we know the number of families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G, we can make an assumption based on the fact that there should be an equal number of families with all boys and all girls (assuming the births are random and the gender does not affect the order).

So, if there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that there should be approximately 45 families with the order B G B B B B.

{answer: 45 (approximately)}
