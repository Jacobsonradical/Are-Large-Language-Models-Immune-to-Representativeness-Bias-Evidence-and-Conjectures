To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations. The order of births for six children can be arranged in 6! (6 factorial) ways.

The arrangement G B G B B G has 2 boys and 4 girls. The arrangement B G B B B B has 6 boys and no girls.

The number of ways to arrange 2 boys and 4 girls is C(6,2) * C(4,4) = 15 * 1 = 15 ways.

The number of ways to arrange 6 boys is C(6,6) = 1.

So, the total number of ways to arrange boys and girls in the order B G B B B G or B G B B B B G is 15 * 1 + 1 = 16 ways.

Since there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B G is 45 * (16/15) â‰ˆ 48 families.

{answer: 48 families}
