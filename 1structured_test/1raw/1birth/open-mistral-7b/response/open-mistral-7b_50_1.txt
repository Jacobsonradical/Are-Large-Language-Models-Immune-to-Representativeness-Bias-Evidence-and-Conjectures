I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for the estimate of the number of families where the exact order of births is B (boy) G (girl) B (boy) B (boy) B (boy). This is a permutation problem, but since the gender of the child doesn't matter (B can represent either a boy or a girl), it is a combination problem.

There are 2 types of positions (B or G) and 6 positions to fill. So, the total number of combinations is C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15.

However, we need to account for the fact that the order of boys and girls doesn't matter. So, we divide the total number of combinations by 2! (since we can swap the positions of the first boy and girl without changing the birth order).

So, the estimated number of families where the exact order of births is B G B B B B is 15 / 2 = 7.5.

Since the number of families must be a whole number, it's likely that the actual number is either 7 or 8 (we don't have enough information to determine which). Therefore, a more conservative estimate would be 7 families.
