I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or directly observe data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy. Let's denote this as B G B B B G.

The number of children in each family is six, and there are two genders: boy and girl. So, there are C = 2^6 = 64 possible orders of births (permutations).

We know that one of the orders is G B G B B G, which is counted in the 45 families with the order B G G B B G. Therefore, the number of families with the order B G B B B B is the total number of possible orders minus the number of families with the order B G G B B G, which is 64 - 45 = 19.

So, your estimate would be:
{answer: 19}
