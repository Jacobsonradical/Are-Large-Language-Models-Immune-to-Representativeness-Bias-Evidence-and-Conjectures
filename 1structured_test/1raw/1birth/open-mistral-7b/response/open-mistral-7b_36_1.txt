To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probability. First, let's find the probability of having a boy (B) as the first child. Since we don't have specific data about the gender ratio, we'll assume a 50-50 ratio for simplicity. So, the probability of a boy is 0.5.

Next, since we already have a boy, the probability of having a girl (G) as the second child is also 0.5. This continues for the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth children, giving us a total probability of having all six children in the order B G B B B B as (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.015625 or 1.5625% chance.

However, since we're looking for an estimate, we can round up to 1.6% or 1 in 62 families having this exact birth order.

{answer: approximately 1 in 62 families}
