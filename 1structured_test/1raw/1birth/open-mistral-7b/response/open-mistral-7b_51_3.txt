I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

There are 6! (factorial) ways to arrange 6 children, which is 720 ways in total. To find the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B G, we subtract the number of families with G B G B B G order from the total, since these two orders are simply swapped.

There are also 6! ways to arrange 6 children in the order G B B B B G.

So, your estimate would be:

{answer: 720 (total arrangements) - 6! (arrangements with G first) = 720 - 720 = 0}

However, this seems to be a contradiction. The question mentions there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G. This suggests there might be an error or misunderstanding in the question or its interpretation. I would recommend checking the information again.
