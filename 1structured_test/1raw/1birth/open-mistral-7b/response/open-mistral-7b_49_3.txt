The question asks for an estimate of the number of families that have the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy (B) Boy (B) Boy (B) Boy (B).

Since the number of boys and girls in each family is six, and the order of the boys and girls doesn't matter (as long as it's Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Boy Boy), we can treat this as a problem of arranging six identical objects (Bs or Gs) in a specific order (BBBBGG or GGGGBB).

The number of ways to arrange six identical objects in a specific order is given by the formula n! / (r_1! * r_2! * ... * r_k!), where n is the total number of objects, and r_1, r_2, ..., r_k are the numbers of objects in each of the k distinct groups. For this problem, n = 6, and r_1 = r_2 = 3 (since there are 3 boys and 3 girls).

So, the number of ways to arrange the boys and girls in the specified order is 6! / (3! * 3!) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 20.

However, since the order of the boys and girls doesn't matter, we need to divide this number by 2 (since there are two possible orders: BBGGGBB and GBGBGBB).

So, the total number of ways to have six children with the exact order of births as Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Boy Boy is 20 / 2 = 10.

Since we know that 45 families have the exact order of births as Girl Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Girl, and we want to find the number of families with the exact order as Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Boy Boy Girl, we can subtract the number we found from the total number of families with the specified order and divide by 2 (to account for the two possible orders).

So, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births as Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Boy Boy Girl is 10 - 45 / 2 = 10 - 22.5 â‰ˆ 7.5.

However, since the number of families cannot be a fraction, we might interpret this as meaning that the actual number is less than 10 but more than 7.

So, a possible estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Boy Boy Girl is between 7 and 10 families.
