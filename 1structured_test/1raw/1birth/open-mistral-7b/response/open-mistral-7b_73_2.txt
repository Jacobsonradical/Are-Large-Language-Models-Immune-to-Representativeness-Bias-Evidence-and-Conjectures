I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using a bit of probability.

In a family of six children, there are 6! (factorial) ways to arrange the boys (B) and girls (G) in any order. The number of ways to arrange six children with exactly three boys and three girls is given by the combination C(6,3) = 6! / (3! * 3!) = 20.

Now, let's consider the specific arrangement you're interested in: B G B B B B. This is one of the 20 possible arrangements with three boys and three girls.

The arrangement you're not interested in is G B G B B B G. This is also one of the 20 possible arrangements, but it's the same as the first arrangement in reverse. So, there's only one unique arrangement to consider for this case.

Since there are twice as many favorable arrangements as the arrangement you're not interested in, the number of families with the arrangement B G B B B B B would be half the total number of favorable arrangements, which is 20/2 = 10 families.

However, this is an estimation based on the given information. In reality, the actual number could be different due to variation in births of boys and girls in real families.
