I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

The problem asks for the number of families with all boys or all girls in the same order (B G B B B B or B BB BB BB BB). Since we know the number of families with the order G B G B B G, we can use this information to make an estimation.

First, let's consider the number of families with all boys. The number of ways to arrange 6 boys (B's) is C(6, 6) = 1, where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.

Similarly, the number of families with all girls is also C(6, 6) = 1.

Now, let's consider the family with the order G B G B B G. Since there are 5 positions for girls (G's) and 1 position for a boy (B), the number of ways to arrange this family is C(5, 4) * 1 = 5.

Since there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, the total number of families with all boys or all girls is 2 * 1 + 1 * 5 = 7.

However, since we know that there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, it means that there must be an overlap between the families with all boys and all girls, which is represented by the families with the order B G B B B B.

So, if we subtract the 45 families with the order G B G B B G from the total number of families with all boys or all girls (7), we get an estimate of the number of families with the order B G B B B B: 7 - 45 = -38.

This answer doesn't make sense because the number of families must be a non-negative integer. This indicates that the given information is not sufficient to make a reliable estimation. It's possible that more information about the distribution of boys and girls in the city or the survey methodology is needed to make a more accurate estimation.
