I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or have real-time data. However, I can provide an approach to solve this problem based on the information given.

The question states that there are 45 families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G. This implies that there are more families with boys born first, as the number of girls (G) is always less than the number of boys (B) in each family by at least one.

Let's denote the number of families with boys born first as B and families with girls born first as G. We know that B + G = total number of families (let's say T).

We also know that in B families, the order is B G G B B G, and in G families, the order is B G G B B B. So, the total number of boys born first in both cases is B + G.

Since each family has six children, there are 6B + 6G boys in total. But we know that there are 45 families with B + G boys born first, and each of these families has 5 boys born after the first boy. So, we can write an equation:

(B + G) * 5 = 6B + 6G - 45

Solving this equation for B or G will give us the number of families with boys born first. Once we have that, we can simply subtract it from the total number of families (T) to find the number of families with girls born first, which will have the order B G B B B B.

Unfortunately, I can't solve the equation for you directly, as I don't have the value of T. However, I hope this approach helps you to solve the problem with the actual data.

{answer: The number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is estimated to be T - (B + G), where B and G are solutions to the equation (B + G) * 5 = 6B + 6G - 45 and T is the total number of families surveyed.}
