I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

Given that the question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Boy, Girl, the number of families with the exact order of Boy, Girl, Boy, Girl, Boy, Boy would be the same, as the gender of the first child doesn't affect the order of the remaining five.

So, to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, you could divide the number of families with the order G B G B B G by 2.

However, without the actual number of families with the order G B G B B G, I can't provide a specific numerical answer.

So, your estimate would be:
{answer: half the number of families with the order G B G B B G}
