I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem to make an estimate.

The number of ways to arrange 6 distinct elements (boys 'B' and girls 'G') in a row without regard to their gender is given by the formula for permutations: P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)! where n is the total number of elements and r is the number of elements in the arrangement.

In this case, n = 6 (6 children) and r = 6 (6 places in the arrangement). So, the total number of arrangements is P(6, 6) = 6! / (6-6)! = 720.

Now, for the arrangement B G B B B B, we have 3 'B's and 3 'G's. The number of ways to arrange 3 'B's and 3 'G's in this order is given by P(3, 3) = 3! / (3-3)! = 6.

There are other arrangements with 3 'B's and 3 'G's, such as G B G B B G. The number of such arrangements is also 6, because there are 6 ways to choose which 3 positions will be filled with 'B's.

Since there are 2 such arrangements (B G B B B B and G B G B B G), and we know that 45 families had the arrangement G B G B B B G, we can estimate that there are 45 * 2 / 6 = 30 families with the arrangement B G B B B B.

So, your estimate would be:
{answer: 30}
