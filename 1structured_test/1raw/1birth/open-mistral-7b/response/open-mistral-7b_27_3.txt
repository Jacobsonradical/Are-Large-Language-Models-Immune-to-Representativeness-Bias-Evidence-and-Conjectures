I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly collect or analyze data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

For each gender (boy or girl), there are 2 possible positions for the first birth in a family with 6 children. Once the position of the first child is determined, the position of the other children of that gender is also determined (since the order is fixed as B G G B B G).

For boys, there are 2 possible positions for the first boy (B). After placing the first boy, there are 5 positions left for the 4 boys. So, there are C(5, 4) = 5 ways to place the remaining 4 boys.

Similarly, for girls, there are 2 possible positions for the first girl (G). After placing the first girl, there are 5 positions left for the 5 girls. So, there are C(5, 4) = 5 ways to place the remaining 4 girls.

Since the order of the boys and girls is fixed, we can multiply the number of ways to place the boys by the number of ways to place the girls. So, the number of families with the exact order of births as B G G B B B is 2 * 5 * 5 = 50.

However, this calculation assumes that each family has at least one boy and one girl. If the city surveyed includes families with only boys or only girls, then this calculation would overestimate the number of families with the specified birth order.

Therefore, without more information about the gender distribution in the city, I can't provide a precise estimate. But based on the given information, an estimate would be 50 families.
