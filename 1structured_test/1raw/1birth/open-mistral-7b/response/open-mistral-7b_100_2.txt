I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

In this case, you're asked for an estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy.

Since the question mentions that the order was G B G B B G in 45 families, it implies that there are more families with boys born first than with girls. This is because the question specifies the exact order of births, and in the given order, there are more opportunities for boys to be born first.

So, if we assume that there are more families with B as the first birth, we can estimate that the number of families with B G B B B B would be less than the number of families with G B G B B G.

However, without more specific information, it's impossible for me to provide a precise number. I would suggest conducting further analysis or gathering more data to make a more accurate estimate.

{answer: Unable to provide a precise number. More data or analysis is required.}
