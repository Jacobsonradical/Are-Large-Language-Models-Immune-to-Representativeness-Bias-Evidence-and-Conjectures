To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. First, let's find out how many families have at least one boy born first.

1. Families with at least one boy born first:
   - Families with all boys: C(6, 6) = 1 (only one way to have 6 boys)
   - Families with 5 boys and 1 girl: C(6, 5) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 1 = 15
   - Families with 4 boys and 2 girls: C(6, 4) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 1 = 15
   - Families with 3 boys, 2 girls, and 1 more boy: C(6, 3) * C(2, 2) * C(1, 1) = 20 * 15 * 1 = 300
   - Families with 3 boys, 3 girls, and 1 more boy: C(6, 3) * C(3, 3) * C(1, 1) = 20 * 6 * 1 = 120
   Total families with at least one boy born first = 1 + 15 + 15 + 300 + 120 = 451

Now, let's find out how many families have at least one girl born first:

1. Families with at least one girl born first:
   - Families with all girls: C(6, 6) = 1 (only one way to have 6 girls)
   - Families with 5 girls and 1 boy: C(6, 5) * C(1, 1) = 15 * 1 = 15
   - Families with 4 girls and 2 boys: C(6, 4) * C(2, 2) = 15 * 1 = 15
   - Families with 3 girls, 3 boys, and 1 more girl: C(6, 3) * C(3, 3) * C(1, 1) = 20 * 6 * 1 = 120
   Total families with at least one girl born first = 1 + 15 + 15 + 120 = 151

Finally, let's find out the number of families with an exact order of births as B G B B B B:

1. Families with exactly 6 girls: 0 (there are no such families)
2. Families with 5 boys and 1 girl: C(5, 5) * C(1, 1) = 120 * 1 = 120
3. Families with 4 boys, 2 girls, and 0 more boys: C(4, 4) * C(2, 2) = 6 * 1 = 6

Now, use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to estimate the number of families with an exact order of births as B G B B B B:

Total families with B G B B B B = Families with 5 boys and 1 girl - Families with at least one girl born first + Families with at least one boy born first - Total families

Estimate = 120 - 151 + 451 - 451 = 0 families

However, this result does not make sense since we know there are some families with this exact order of births. This means that our survey may not have captured all families or our estimation method may not be accurate.

Therefore, I cannot provide a reliable estimate in the given format. I recommend revisiting the survey methodology or using a different estimation method to get a more accurate result.
