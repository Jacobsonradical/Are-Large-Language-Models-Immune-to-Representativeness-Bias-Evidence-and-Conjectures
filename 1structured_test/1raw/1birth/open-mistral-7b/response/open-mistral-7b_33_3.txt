To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations. First, let's calculate the total number of permutations for six children, without considering gender. This is done by calculating the factorial of six (6!), which is 720.

Now, let's consider the gender of the children. Boys and girls are not distinguishable, so we treat them as the same type of object. In this case, we have 3 boys and 3 girls. The total number of ways to arrange these 6 objects (3B and 3G) is also calculated by finding the factorial of 6, but dividing it by the factorial of the number of identical objects (3B or 3G), which is 3!.

So, the total number of ways to arrange 3B and 3G is 720 / (3! * 3!) = 120.

However, we are interested in the specific order B G B B B B, which is one of the 6! permutations that include only boys first. Therefore, the number of families with this exact order is 1 out of 6!, or approximately 0.00179 (using a calculator to find the fraction 1/6!).

To estimate the number of families with this exact order, we can multiply this fraction by the total number of families surveyed, which is 45.

{answer: 0.00179 * 45 â‰ˆ 0.078}

So, our estimate is that there are approximately 0.078 or 8 families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.
