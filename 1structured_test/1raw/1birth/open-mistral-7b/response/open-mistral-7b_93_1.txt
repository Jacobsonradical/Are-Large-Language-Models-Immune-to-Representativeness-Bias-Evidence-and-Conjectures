To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations. First, let's understand that there are 2 types of children: boys (B) and girls (G).

In this case, we are looking for families with 6 children where the order of births is B G B B B B. Since the gender of the children doesn't matter for the question, let's treat them as identical items.

The number of permutations for 6 identical items is given by the formula:

n! / (n - r)!

where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to arrange.

Here, n = 6 (total children), and r = 6 (since all 6 children are being arranged in order).

So, the number of permutations for this order is:

6! / (6 - 6)! = 720 / 1 = 720

However, we already know that there are 45 families with the order of births G B G B B G. Since these families have already been accounted for, we subtract the number of such families from the total number of permutations to find out how many families have the order B G B B B B.

So, our estimate is:

{answer: 720 - 45} = 675

Therefore, our estimate is that there are 675 families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.
