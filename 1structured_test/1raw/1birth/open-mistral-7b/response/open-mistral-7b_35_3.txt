I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using logical reasoning.

In a family of six children, there are two possible orders for boys (B) and girls (G) if we consider the gender of the first child as a starting point. Since we're interested in the order B G B B B B, let's start by considering the boy as the first child:

1. B G B B B B: This is one way to arrange six children with two boys and four girls.

Now, let's consider the girl as the first child:

1. G B G B B B: This is another arrangement that fits the order we're interested in, but it's actually the same as the first arrangement (B G B B B B) if we switch the first and second children. So, we only have one new arrangement.

However, we should also consider the case where the first two children are of the same gender (either both boys or both girls). In that case, we can switch the positions of the first two children to get the desired order:

1. B B G G G G: This is a family with four boys and two girls, and if we switch the first two children, we get the order B G B B B B.
2. G G B B B B: This is a family with four girls and two boys, and if we switch the first two children, we get the order B G B B B B.

So, we have three ways to arrange six children to get the order B G B B B B: one starting with a boy and two starting with a girl. Since we know that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G, we can estimate that there are 45 - 3 = {answer: 42} families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Again, remember that this is an estimate based on logical reasoning, and actual results may vary depending on the data collected in the survey.
