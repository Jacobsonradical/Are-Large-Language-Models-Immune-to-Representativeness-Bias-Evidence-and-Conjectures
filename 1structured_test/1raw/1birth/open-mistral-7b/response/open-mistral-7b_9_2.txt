To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations. First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange 6 children, regardless of gender. This is a permutation of 6 items taken 6 at a time, which is calculated as 6! (6 factorial).

Now, let's consider the families with 6 girls. There are 6! ways to arrange 6 girls, but since we are interested in the exact order, we need to divide by 6! to account for the fact that arranging 6 girls in the same order is the same arrangement. So, the number of families with 6 girls is 6! / 6! = 1.

Now, let's consider the families with 6 boys. Again, there are 6! ways to arrange them, but since we are interested in the exact order, we divide by 6!, giving us 1 family.

There are also families with a mix of boys and girls, and we can calculate the number of these families by finding the number of ways to arrange 'b' boys and 'g' girls, where b + g = 6, and multiplying this by the number of ways to arrange the boys and girls separately. This is equivalent to calculating the number of ways to choose b boys out of 6 (6 choose b) and then the number of ways to choose g girls out of the remaining 6 - b girls.

Now, let's calculate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B. There are 6 choose 0 ways to choose 0 boys (which means 6 girls), and 6 choose 6 ways to choose 6 boys (which means no girls). However, we are interested in families with at least 1 boy and at least 1 girl, so we need to add these two extreme cases to the sum of families with 1 to 5 boys and 1 to 5 girls.

To keep our estimate simple, let's assume that the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is approximately equal to the number of families with 3 boys and 3 girls. To calculate this, we multiply the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 6 by the number of ways to choose 3 girls out of 6, and then multiply this by the number of ways to arrange the 3 boys and 3 girls separately.

{answer: approximately 153 families}
