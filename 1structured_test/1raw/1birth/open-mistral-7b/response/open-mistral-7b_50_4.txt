To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of complementary probabilities. First, let's find the probability of having a family with the order of births G B G B B G.

The probability of having a girl (G) first is 1/2 (since there are two genders). After that, a boy (B) is born, so the probability is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4. This pattern continues, so the probability of having a family with the order of births G B G B B G is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/32.

Now, we know there are 45 families with the order of births G B G B B G. To find out the number of families with the order of births B G B B B B, we can use the complementary probability:

{answer: 45 * (1 - 1/32)}

To calculate this, simply multiply 45 by the probability of not having a family with the order of births B G B B B B:

{answer: 45 * 31/32}

This is an estimate, as the survey was not conducted with replacement, and the order of births in each family may affect future birth orders in other families. However, without more information, this is the best estimate we can provide.
