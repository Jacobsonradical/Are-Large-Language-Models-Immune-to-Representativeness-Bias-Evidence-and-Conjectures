To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) B B B B, we can use the concept of complementary probability. First, let's find out the probability of having at least one boy first in a family of six.

1. There are C(6, 1) ways to choose the position for the first boy (1 boy and 5 other positions), and C(5, 5) ways to choose the positions for the five girls. So, the total number of ways to arrange B G B B B B is C(6, 1) * C(5, 5) = 6 * 120 = 720 ways.

2. Now, we know that there are C(6, 5) ways to choose the positions for five boys and one girl. So, the number of ways to arrange B G B B B is C(6, 1) * C(5, 5) = 6 * 720 = 4320 ways.

3. The probability of having at least one boy first is the sum of the probabilities of having exactly 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 boys first. The probability of having exactly k boys first is C(k, 1) * C(5, 5-k) / C(6, 6) = k * C(5, 5-k) / 6.

4. The sum of these probabilities can be computed by adding up k from 1 to 5. Using this, we find that the probability of having at least one boy first is around 0.9467.

5. Now, we can find the complementary probability of having all girls first by subtracting 0.9467 from 1, which gives us around 0.0533.

6. The probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B is the complementary probability multiplied by the total number of families with six children. Let's assume there are N families with six children. Then, the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is around 0.0533 * N families.

Since the exact number of families with six children is not provided, we can only estimate the number of families with the desired order of births as around 0.0533 * N families.
