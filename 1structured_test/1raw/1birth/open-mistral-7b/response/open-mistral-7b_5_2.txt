Given that the question only provides information about families with the order of births as G B G B B G, and there's no mention of families with the order B G B B B B, I cannot provide an estimate for that particular order. The survey results only give us information about one specific order of births. For a more accurate answer, additional data would be needed.

{answer: Unable to provide an estimate without more information}
