I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand the concept and provide an answer based on basic probability principles.

The question asks for the estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl (B G B B B G).

Since we know there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can consider this as a starting point. To find the number of families with the reversed order B G B B B G, we can assume that the genders are independent events.

There are two arrangements possible with 6 distinct elements (B and G):

1. There are C(6, 2) = 15 ways to choose 2 positions for the girls out of 6 positions.
2. Then there are C(4, 4) = 1 ways to choose the positions for the 4 boys among the remaining 4 positions.

So, there are 15 * 1 = 15 families with the order B G B B B G.

However, we have counted each family twice (once for each order), so we need to divide the total number of families with the same order by 2 to avoid double-counting:

{answer: 15 families divided by 2 = 7.5 families}

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can conclude that there are either 7 or 8 families with the exact order of births as Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl Girl (B G B B B G). Without more data, it's not possible to determine the exact number.
