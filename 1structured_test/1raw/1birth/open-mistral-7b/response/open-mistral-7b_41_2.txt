Given that the survey only provides information about families with the specific order of births G B G B B G, we cannot make a direct comparison or estimate for the number of families with the order of births B G B B B B. However, we can make an assumption based on the symmetry of the gender distribution.

Assuming that the likelihood of a boy or a girl being born first is the same, and that the order of births for boys and girls is independent, then there should be as many families with B G B B B B as there are with G B G B B G. Although the survey data does not allow for this direct comparison, it suggests that the number of families with B G B B B B might also be around 45.

However, this is just an assumption based on symmetry and does not account for factors that may influence the birth order, such as genetic or environmental factors. Therefore, the actual number may be different.

{answer: around 45 (assuming equal likelihood of first-born gender and independent orders of birth)}
