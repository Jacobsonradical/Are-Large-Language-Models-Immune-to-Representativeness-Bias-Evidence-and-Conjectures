To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the original survey data only provided information about families with the specific order G B G B B G. Without additional information, we cannot make a precise estimate of the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

However, if we assume that the gender ratio of boys to girls is approximately 1:1, we can make an estimate. In families with six children, there are 6C5 = 15 ways to arrange 5 girls among the 6 children, and there are 6C1 = 6 ways to place the single boy in a position among the girls. So, there are 15 * 6 = 90 possible arrangements of girls.

Similarly, there are 6C5 = 15 ways to arrange 5 boys among the 6 children, and there are 6C1 = 6 ways to place the single girl in a position among the boys. So, there are 15 * 6 = 90 possible arrangements of boys.

Since we are interested in the number of arrangements where all boys come before all girls, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of arrangements of boys by the number of arrangements of girls, and then subtracting the number of arrangements with mixed genders.

The number of arrangements with mixed genders is the number of ways to arrange 3 boys and 3 girls, which is 6C3 * 6C3 = 126.

So, the number of arrangements with all boys before all girls is 90 * 90 - 126 = 8040 - 126 = 7914.

However, since there are two types of arrangements with all boys before all girls (B B B B B B and B B B B B G G), the actual number of such families is half of 7914, which is approximately 3957.

Therefore, our estimate is:
{answer: 3957}
