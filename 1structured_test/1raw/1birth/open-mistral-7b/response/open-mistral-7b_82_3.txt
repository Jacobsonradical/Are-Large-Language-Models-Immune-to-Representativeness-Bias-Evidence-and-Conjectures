I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using combinatorics.

The exact order of births of boys and girls can be represented as a permutation of B's and G's. In this case, you're asking for the number of permutations of BBBGGG.

The total number of permutations of 6 elements (B's and G's) is 6! (factorial of 6), which equals 720.

Since we're interested in the number of permutations where boys come first, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of ways to arrange the 3 boys (3!) by the number of ways to arrange the 3 girls (3!), and then multiply this by 2 (since the order of boys and girls is the same).

So, the number of permutations with B's first is: 3! * 3! * 2 = 6 * 6 * 2 = 120.

Therefore, if there are 45 families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G, and the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is 120, then your estimate of the total number of families surveyed would be 45 + 120 = 165 families.

However, since the question asks for an estimate, it's important to note that this is a theoretical calculation and the actual number could be different due to various factors such as sampling error, non-response, etc. in a real-world survey.
