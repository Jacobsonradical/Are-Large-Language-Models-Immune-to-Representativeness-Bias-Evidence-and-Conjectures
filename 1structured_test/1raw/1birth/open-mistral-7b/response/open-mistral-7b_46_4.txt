To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the following reasoning:

1. The question mentions that 45 families have the order G B G B B G.
2. Since the gender of each child is known, we can think of the order of births as a permutation of two types of elements: B and G.
3. In the case of G B G B B G, there are 5 'gaps' between the gender types.
4. If we consider the opposite order, B B B B B G B, there are also 5 'gaps.'
5. Therefore, when flipping the order of the second half of the sequence, we maintain the same number of gaps.
6. This means that for every family with the order G B G B B G, there is another family with the order B B B B B G B.
7. Since there are 45 families with the first order, we would estimate that there are also 45 families with the second order.
