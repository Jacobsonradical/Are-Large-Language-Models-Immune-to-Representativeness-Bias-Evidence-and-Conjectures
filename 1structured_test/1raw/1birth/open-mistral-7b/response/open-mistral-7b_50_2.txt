To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations. In this case, we are looking for the number of ways to arrange 6 children (2 boys and 4 girls) where the boys always come before the girls.

First, let's find the total number of ways to arrange 6 children without any restrictions. This is a permutation with 6 items, which can be calculated using the formula: P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!. Here, n = 6 (total children) and r = 6 (total positions).

So, the total number of arrangements is P(6, 6) = 6! / (6-6)! = 720.

Now, let's find the number of arrangements where we fix the positions of the 2 boys and fill the remaining 4 positions with girls. We can do this by calculating the number of arrangements for the 4 girls and multiplying it by the number of ways to place the 2 boys (2 factorials, since the positions of the boys don't matter).

The number of arrangements for 4 girls is P(4, 4) = 4! / (4-4)! = 24.

Since there are 2! ways to place the 2 boys, the total number of arrangements with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is 24 * 2 = 48.

However, since we only know that there are 45 families with the order of births as G B G B B G, our estimate for the number of families with the order of births as B G B B B B is lower than 48. We cannot say for sure, but it's likely that there are fewer than 48 families with this exact order of birth.

Therefore, our estimate is:
{answer: less than 48}
