I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem.

In a family with six children, there are 720 possible orders of birth (6!, factorial means multiplying all positive integers less than or equal to that number).

To find the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, you subtract the number of families with the order you're interested in from the total number of families.

First, let's find the number of families with the order of B G B B B G. Since the order of boys and girls doesn't matter, we can treat this as a problem of arranging 3 boys (Bs) and 3 girls (Gs) in 6 places. This can be calculated using the formula for permutations, which is 6! / (3! * 3!) = 20.

Now, to find the number of families with the order of B G B B B B, we subtract this from the total number of families: 720 - 20 = 700.

So, your estimate would be:
{answer: 700}
