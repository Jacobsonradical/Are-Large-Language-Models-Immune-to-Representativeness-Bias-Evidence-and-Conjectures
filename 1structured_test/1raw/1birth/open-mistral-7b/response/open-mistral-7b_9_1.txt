To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations. In this case, we are looking for the number of ways to arrange 6 positions (representing the children) with 3 boys (B) and 3 girls (G), where the order matters.

The total number of permutations for 6 items is 6! (factorial): 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720.

The number of ways to arrange 3 boys and 3 girls without considering their positions is given by the product of their factorials: 3! (factorial) for boys and 3! for girls:

Number of arrangements without considering order = 3! * 3! = 6 * 6 = 36

However, since the order of the boys and girls does matter in this case, we must divide the total number of permutations by the number of arrangements without considering order:

Estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B = Total permutations / Arrangements without considering order
                                                               = 720 / 36
                                                               ≈ 20

So, our estimate is that there are approximately 20 families in the city with the exact order of births as B G B B B B.
