To answer this question, we need to make an assumption as there isn't enough information to make a definitive answer. Since the question asks for an "estimate," we can assume that the gender of children is independent of each other's birth order (i.e., the probability of a boy or a girl being born in any position is the same).

Given this assumption, we know that there are 2 possible orders for boys (BBBBBB and BGBGBGBGB) and 1 possible order for girls (GGGGGG). If gender is independent, then each of these orders should occur with the same probability in the population.

The question gives us the frequency of one of these orders (G B G B B G), so we can infer the probability of this order. If the probability of this order is p, then the probability of the opposite order (B G B B B B) is also p, since gender is independent.

However, the question does not give us the number of families with the order B G B B B B. Since we only know the probability of this order, we cannot give an exact number.

Therefore, our estimate would be:
{answer: The number of families with the order B G B B B B is likely to be similar to the number of families with the order G B G B B G. Since we know there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, our estimate is that there are likely to be around 45 families with the order B G B B B B. However, this is just an estimate based on the assumption of gender independence, and the actual number could be different.}
