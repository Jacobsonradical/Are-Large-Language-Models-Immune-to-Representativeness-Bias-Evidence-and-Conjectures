To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can make an assumption based on the given information and the fact that there are two genders (boys and girls). Since the question mentions that the order of boys (B) and girls (G) is always the same in each family, we can consider the order as alternating between boys and girls.

Given that the first child is a boy (B), the next child must be a girl (G). After that, the pattern repeats, so the order must be alternating. Therefore, if we know that the order B G G B B G appears in 45 families, we can infer that the reverse order G B G B B G appears in an equal number of families, assuming no bias in birth order.

Since the total number of families is not provided, we cannot provide an exact number. However, we can estimate that there could be approximately 45 families with the order B G B B B B, given that the reverse order G B G B B G also occurs in an equal number of families.

So, the answer is:
{answer: approximately 45 families}
