I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to perform real-time surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem if you had that data.

The question asks for the number of families with six children in the exact order of births as Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy.

If you know the total number of families with six children and the number of families with six children in the specific order of G B G B B G, you can subtract the number you already know from the total to get your estimate.

However, without this data, I'm unable to provide a specific estimate.
