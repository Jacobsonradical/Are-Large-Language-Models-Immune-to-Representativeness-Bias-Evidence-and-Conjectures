I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or have real-time data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem based on given information.

In this case, the question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy (B) Boy (B) Boy (B).

The number of families with the order G B G B B G was given as 45. Since the order of boys and girls does not matter (except for the case where all six children are the same gender), we can treat each G B G B B G as two different families: one with the order B G B B B B and one with the order G B G B B B.

So, if there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, then there should be approximately 45 * 2 = 90 families with the order B G B B B B.

However, without more specific information, this is just an estimate. The actual number could be different due to factors like birth rate, family size, or the specific population of the city being surveyed.
