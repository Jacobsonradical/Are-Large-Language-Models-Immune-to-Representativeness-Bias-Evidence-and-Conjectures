To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations. In this case, we have 6 children, 3 boys (B) and 3 girls (G). We want to find the number of ways to arrange 6 elements (3B and 3G) in a specific order (B G B B B B).

The number of ways to arrange 6 elements is calculated using the formula for permutations, which is n! (n factorial), where n is the number of elements. However, since we are looking for a specific order of elements, we need to divide the total number of permutations by the number of permutations for the desired order.

The number of permutations for 3B and 3G in any order is 6! / (3! * 3!) = 20, since there are 6 spots to fill, and we can choose 3 spots for boys (B) and 3 spots for girls (G) in 6! ways.

Now, we want to find the number of permutations for 3B and 3G in the specific order of B G B B B B. This can be calculated as 3! * 2! = 12, since we have 3 spots for boys (B) before the 3 spots for girls (G).

Finally, we can estimate the number of families with the desired order by dividing the total number of permutations by the number of permutations for the desired order: 20 / 12 â‰ˆ 1.67.

Since the number of families cannot be a fraction, it is more reasonable to assume that there are no families with this specific order, as the survey reported a specific number of families with the G B G B B G order.

However, if we assume that there might be some errors in the survey or some families did not participate, we could estimate a small number of families with this order. For example, if we assume that there might be 1 or 2 families with this order, then our estimate would be:
