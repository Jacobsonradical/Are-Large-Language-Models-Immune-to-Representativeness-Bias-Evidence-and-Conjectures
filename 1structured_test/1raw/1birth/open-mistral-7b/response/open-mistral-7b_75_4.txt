I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or have real-time data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using basic probability concepts.

The problem asks for the number of families with six children in the exact order of births as Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy. Let's calculate the number of ways to arrange six objects (three Bs and three Gs) in this specific order.

We can use the concept of permutations (arrangements with order important) to calculate this. The number of permutations of n items is n! (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to n.

However, since the first position can be filled with either a B or a G, we have two possible ways to start. So, we'll multiply our final result by 2 to account for this.

First, let's calculate the number of ways to arrange the remaining five objects (2Bs and 3Gs): (2Bs)! * (3Gs)! = 2! * 3! = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, multiply this by the two possibilities for the first position: 12 * 2 = 24

So, the estimated number of families with this exact order of births is 24.

{answer: 24}
