As this data provides information about the order of births of boys and girls being G B G B B G in 45 families, but not about the order of births being B G B B B B, we cannot make a precise estimate based on the given information.

However, we can make an assumption to estimate the number of families with the order of births B G B B B B. Since the order of births is random, we might expect an equal probability of both orders (G B G B B G and B G B B B B G) occurring. If this is true, then we could expect half the number of families to have the order B G B B B B G.

So, based on this assumption, our estimate would be:
{answer: approximately half the number of families with the order G B G B B G, which is 45/2 = 22.5 families. However, since the number of families cannot be a fraction, we would round this estimate to the nearest whole number, which is 23 families.}
