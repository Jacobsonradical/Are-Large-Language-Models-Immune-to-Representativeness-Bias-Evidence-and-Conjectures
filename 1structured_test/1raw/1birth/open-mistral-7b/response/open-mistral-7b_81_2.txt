This is a probability problem, and without more information about the gender ratio of boys to girls in the city, I'm unable to provide an exact number. However, I can provide an estimate based on the assumption of equal probability of a boy or girl being born.

In a family with six children, there are 720 different orderings of the children (6!, factorial of 6). If we assume equal probability of boys and girls, then there are two possibilities for the first child (boy or girl), two for the second (the other gender), and so on. Therefore, the total number of orderings with distinct genders is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 64.

Now, let's consider the families with the exact order of births B G B B B B. We know that there are 45 families with the order B G G B B G. Since the order B G G B B G and B G B B B B G are the same (just reversed), there are actually 90 families with this exact order (2 * 45).

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B by subtracting the number of families with the order B G G B B G from the total number of families with distinct genders:

{answer: 64 - 90 â‰ˆ -26}

However, since the number of families cannot be negative, it's likely that our assumption of equal probability of boys and girls was incorrect, or that the information provided is incomplete or inconsistent. In such cases, it's best to seek further clarification or information before making an estimate.
