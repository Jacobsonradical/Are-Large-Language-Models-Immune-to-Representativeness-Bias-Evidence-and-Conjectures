To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the exact data is not provided. We'll assume that the gender of children in a family is independent of the gender of children in other families. Given this assumption, we can consider the probability of having boys and girls in any order as equal.

There are 6! (6 factorial) ways to arrange 6 children, which is 720. If we consider the "Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Girl" arrangement as one type, there are 6! ways to arrange 6 children in this way.

Similarly, there are 6! ways to arrange the children in the order "Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Boy," which is the arrangement we want to find.

Since we assume equal probabilities for all orders, the ratio of the number of families with the given order to the total number of families with any order should be equal to the ratio of the number of ways to arrange the children in the desired order to the total number of ways to arrange the children.

So, we estimate that the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

{answer: 6! (number of ways to arrange children in the desired order) / 720 (total number of ways to arrange children) * total number of families surveyed}

= (6! / 720) * 45

= (720 / 720) * 45

= 45

Since this answer is the number of families already given in the question, it indicates that our assumption might be correct for this specific case. However, this does not guarantee that this assumption is always true in real-world scenarios.
