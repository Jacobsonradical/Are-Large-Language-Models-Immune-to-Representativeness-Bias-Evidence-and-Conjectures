I'm sorry for the confusion, but the information provided does not allow for a direct calculation of the number of families with the exact order of B G B B B B. The data only tells us the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we would need additional information or assumptions. For example, if we assumed that the gender distribution in births is even (50% boys and 50% girls), we could potentially make an estimate based on the given data. However, without such assumptions, it's not possible to provide a reliable estimate.
