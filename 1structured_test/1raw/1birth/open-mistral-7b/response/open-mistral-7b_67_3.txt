I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The number of arrangements for six distinct objects (in this case, boys and girls) is given by the formula n!, where n is the number of objects. So, the number of ways to arrange six children (BBBBGG or BBBGGG) is 6! = 720.

For the arrangement G B G B B G, there are 5! ways to arrange the girls and boys in that order (since the gender of the first child is a girl), which is 120.

However, when counting the total arrangements, we should subtract those arrangements that contain repeated patterns (like having multiple sequences of BB or GG). Since we know there are 45 families with the arrangement G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with B G B B B B G by dividing the total number of arrangements by the number of unique patterns.

So, the number of families with B G B B B B G is approximately 720 / 120 = 6 families.

However, since we're dealing with estimates and rounding, it's possible that the actual number of families is slightly more or less than 6. Therefore, a more precise answer would be:

{answer: approximately 6 families}
