I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might estimate this based on the information given.

The question states that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G. This means that the first child is a girl, the second is a boy, the third and fourth are girls again, and the last two are boys.

To estimate the number of families with the exact order of B G B B B B, you could consider the total number of permutations (arrangements) of boys and girls in a family of six, and then subtract the number of families with the G B G B B G order from that total.

The total number of permutations for six items (two types, boys and girls) is given by the formula n! (factorial), where n is the number of items. In this case, n = 6. So, the total number of permutations is 6! = 720.

Since the order of boys and girls does not matter, we can divide this total by 2! (2 factorials) to account for the fact that the order of the two genders can be reversed without changing the family. So, the total number of distinct arrangements is 720 / 2! = 360.

Subtracting the 45 families with the given order, we estimate that there are 360 - 45 = 315 families with the exact order of B G B B B B.

So, in the given format, the answer would be:
{answer: 315}
