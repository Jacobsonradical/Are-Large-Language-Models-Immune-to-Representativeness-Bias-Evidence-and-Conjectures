I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using combinatorics.

First, let's consider the number of ways to arrange 6 children with 2 boys and 4 girls. The total number of permutations for 6 items is 6! (6 factorial), which is 720.

Now, let's find the number of ways to arrange the 2 boys and 4 girls in a specific order, such as B G B B B G. This can be done using factorials as well: 2! (2 factorial) for the 2 boys and 4! (4 factorial) for the 4 girls. So, the number of ways to arrange the boys and girls in this specific order is 2! * 4! = 2 * 24 = 48.

However, when arranging the boys and girls, the order of the boys doesn't matter. So, we need to divide the number of arrangements by the number of ways to arrange the 2 boys, which is 1! (1 factorial), or 1 way. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the boys and girls with the order B G B B B G is 48 / 1 = 48.

Now, let's find out how many families had this specific order. We know that in 45 families, the order was G B G B B G. This means that the order B G B B B G occurred less frequently. By subtracting the number of families with the order G B G B B B G from the total number of families, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B G.

So, the answer to your question would be:

{answer: 720 (total families) - 45 (families with G B G B B G) â‰ˆ 675}

This estimate assumes that the order B G B B B G is less common than G B G B B B G, which might not necessarily be the case. A more accurate estimate would require more specific data about the birth order of boys and girls in the city.
