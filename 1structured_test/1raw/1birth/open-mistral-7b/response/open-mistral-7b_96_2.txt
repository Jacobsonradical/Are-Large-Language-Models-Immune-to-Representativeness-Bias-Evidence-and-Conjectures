I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or directly observe the data. However, I can help you understand the concept and provide an answer based on symmetry principles.

The order of births B G B B B G and B G B B B B G are the same if we consider boys and girls as interchangeable. So, to find the number of families with the order B G B B B B B, we can simply find half of the families with the order G B G B B G B.

In this case, there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G B. So, your estimate for families with the order B G B B B B B B would be:

{answer: 45/2 = 22.5}

However, since we can't have half a family, we round this estimate down to 22 families. The exact number might be higher, but due to the symmetry, it's most likely to be significantly less than the initial 45 families.
