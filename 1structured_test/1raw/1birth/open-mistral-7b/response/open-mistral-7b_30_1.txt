I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

The question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. Since the gender of the first child doesn't affect the order for the remaining five children, we can consider the first child as either a boy or a girl.

If we consider the first child as a boy (B), then the remaining five children must follow the pattern G B B B B. So, we can think of this as a sequence of choosing a girl and then four boys in a row.

The number of ways to choose a girl from six children is C(6,1) = 6, and the number of ways to choose four boys from five remaining boys is C(5,4) = 5.

So, the total number of such sequences is 6 * 5 = 30.

Similarly, if we consider the first child as a girl (G), then the remaining five children must follow the pattern B G B B B. The number of ways to choose a boy from six children is C(6,1) = 6, and the number of ways to choose four girls from five remaining girls is C(5,4) = 1.

So, the total number of such sequences is 6 * 1 = 6.

Since the order of boys and girls doesn't matter, we add the number of sequences for both cases: 30 + 6 = 36.

However, since we are only given information about families with the exact order G B G B B G, and we don't know the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B, our answer is an estimate of 36.

{answer: 36 (estimate)}
