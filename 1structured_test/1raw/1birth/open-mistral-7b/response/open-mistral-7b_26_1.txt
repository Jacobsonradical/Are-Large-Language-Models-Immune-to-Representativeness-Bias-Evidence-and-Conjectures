I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or analyze data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

In a family with six children, there are 720 different ways to arrange boys (B) and girls (G) (using the factorial formula: 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).

If we want to find out how many of these arrangements have exactly 3 boys and 3 girls, we can use combinations: C(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!) = 20.

Now, let's consider the specific order of boys and girls that you've mentioned: B G B B B G. This arrangement of three boys and three girls is fixed. So, within the 20 arrangements that have 3 boys and 3 girls, there's only 1 arrangement that meets this exact order.

Now, let's consider the families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B. Since we know there are 20 arrangements with 3 boys and 3 girls, and there's only 1 arrangement that meets the exact order, we can estimate that there might be 20 families with this exact order of birth.

However, this is an estimate, as the survey might have missed some families or included families that were not part of the city. A more accurate answer would require the actual data from the survey.

{answer: 20 (estimate)}
