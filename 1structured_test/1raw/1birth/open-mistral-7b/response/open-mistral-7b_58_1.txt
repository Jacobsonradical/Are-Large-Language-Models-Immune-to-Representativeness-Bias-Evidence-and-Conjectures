Due to the lack of specific information about the gender distribution in the population or the overall number of families surveyed, it's not possible to provide a precise estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B. However, since there are two possible orders for boys and girls (either boys first or girls first), the number of families with the order B G B B B B should be half the number of families with the order G B G B B G. Therefore, an approximate estimate would be half of 45 families, which equals {answer: 22.5}. Since the number of families cannot be a fraction, it's more appropriate to round down to the nearest whole number, so the estimated number of families is {answer: 22}.
