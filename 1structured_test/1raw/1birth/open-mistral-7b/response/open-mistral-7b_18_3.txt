To answer your question, we need to make an assumption since the survey only provided information about families with the specific order G B G B B G. However, we can make an educated guess based on the symmetry of the gender distribution.

If we assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, then the order B G B B B B would be as unlikely as G B G B B B G, given that the exact order is known. Therefore, we can estimate that there might be the same number of families with the order B G B B B B as there are with the order G B G B B B G.

So, based on the information given, my estimate would be that there are approximately 45 families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B.

{answer: 45 families}
