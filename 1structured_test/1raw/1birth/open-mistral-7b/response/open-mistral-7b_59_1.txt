I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem if you were to collect the data yourself.

The question asks for the number of families with six children where the exact order of births is Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Girl. This is one specific permutation of six objects (three boys and three girls).

To find the number of ways to arrange six objects in this specific order, we can use the concept of permutations. Since the order matters, we use the formula for permutations of n distinct objects: n! (n factorial), where n = 6.

However, we must also consider that the order of boys and girls within the boy and girl groups does not matter. This means that we can treat the three boys and three girls as two groups of three objects each, and use the formula for permutations of two groups of three objects.

The number of ways to arrange the first three objects in either group does not affect the number of ways to arrange the remaining three objects in the other group, so we can multiply the number of arrangements of the three boys by the number of arrangements of the three girls:

3! (3 factorial) * 3! (3 factorial) = 6 * 6 = 36

Now, we need to account for the fact that the order of the two groups of three objects does not matter. This is the same as arranging two groups of three objects without repetition, so we can use the formula for permutations of two distinct objects: 2! (2 factorial) = 2.

Finally, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose the position of the first group of three objects (which can be any of the six positions in the final arrangement) by the number of ways to arrange the two groups:

6 * 36 * 2 = 1,080

Therefore, your estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B G would be 1,080 families.
