I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families where the exact order of births is Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy.

Since we know the number of families with the exact order of boys and girls as Girl, Boy, Girl, Boy, Boy, Girl is 45, we can use this information to find an estimate for the other order.

The order of boys and girls is symmetric around the middle. So if there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, there should also be approximately 45 families with the order B G B B B G.

Therefore, your estimate would be:
{answer: 45} families.
