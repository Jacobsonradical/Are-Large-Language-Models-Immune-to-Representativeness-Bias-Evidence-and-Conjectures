I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for the number of families with six children in the exact order of births as Boys (B) followed by Girls (G): B G B G B G.

Since the order of boys and girls is the same for all families, we can consider the order of boys and the number of girls as two independent events.

First, let's find the number of ways to arrange six boys (B) and five girls (G). This is a problem of permutations with repetitions, which can be calculated using the formula: n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!), where n is the total number of objects, and r1, r2, ..., rk are the number of times each type of object appears. In this case, n = 6 (boys), and r1 = 6 (times boys appear). So, the number of ways to arrange boys is 6! / 6! = 1.

Now, let's find the number of ways to arrange the five girls. This is a problem of permutations without repetitions, which can be calculated as 5! = 120.

Since the order of boys doesn't matter, we need to divide the number of ways to arrange the five girls by the number of ways to arrange the six boys: 120 / 1.

However, we also need to consider that the exact order of boys and girls doesn't matter, so we need to divide the result by 2 (since the first boy can be paired with the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth girl, and the second boy can be paired with the remaining four girls, and so on).

Therefore, the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B G B G is 120 / 1 * 2 / 6 = 20.

However, the question asks for an estimate, and the calculation above assumes that all orders are equally likely. In real life, the exact order might not be equally likely, so an estimate might be lower than 20. It's impossible for me to provide a specific estimate without additional information.
