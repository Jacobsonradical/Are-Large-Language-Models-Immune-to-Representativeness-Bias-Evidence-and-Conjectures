I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

If we consider the order of births as a permutation of boys (B) and girls (G), then the order B G B B B B has 6 boys and 6 girls. The total number of permutations for 6 boys and 6 girls is given by the formula for permutations, which is n!, where n is the number of items. In this case, n = 12 (6 boys + 6 girls).

On the other hand, the order G B G B B G is the reverse of B G B B B B G. Since the order matters, they are considered two different permutations. Therefore, the number of families with the order B G B B B B is not the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

Unfortunately, the question does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of families with the order B G B B B B. To find that, you would need to know the total number of families surveyed and the number of families with the order G B G B B G. With this information, you could calculate the probability of a family having the order B G B B B B and then multiply it by the total number of families to get an estimate.

So, based on the information given, I cannot provide an estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
