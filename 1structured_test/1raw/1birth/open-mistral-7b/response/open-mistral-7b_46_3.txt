To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the exact number of families with this specific birth order is not provided. One reasonable assumption is that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal at every birth, which is often approximated as 50%.

Given this assumption, let's calculate the number of ways to arrange six children with two boys and four girls in the order B G B B B B:

1. Choose 2 positions for the boys: C(6, 2) = 15 ways
2. Fill the remaining 4 positions with girls: C(6, 4) = 15 ways

Now multiply these two counts to get the total number of ways to arrange the children in this order:

Total arrangements = Number of ways to choose 2 boy positions * Number of ways to choose 4 girl positions
                                 = 15 * 15
                                 = 225

Since each arrangement of boys and girls represents a unique family, there should be 225 families with this exact order of births. However, we know that in 45 families, the order was G B G B B G. To find the number of families with the opposite order, we can simply multiply the number of families with the given order by 2:

Families with opposite order = 2 * Families with given order
                                              = 2 * 45
                                              = 90

Now, to find the number of families with the desired order (B G B B B B), we subtract the number of families with the opposite order from the total number of arrangements:

Estimated number of families = Total arrangements - Families with opposite order
                                                    = 225 - 90
                                                    = 135

Thus, our estimate is that there are 135 families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.
