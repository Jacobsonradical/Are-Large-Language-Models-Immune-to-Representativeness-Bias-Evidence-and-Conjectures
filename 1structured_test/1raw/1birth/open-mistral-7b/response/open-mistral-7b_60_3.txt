I'm sorry for the confusion, but the information provided does not allow me to make an estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B. The survey only mentions the order of births for 45 families as G B G B B G, not for any other order. Therefore, I cannot provide an estimate for another specific order.
