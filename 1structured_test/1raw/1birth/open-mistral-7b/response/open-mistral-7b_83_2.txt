To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the survey data only provides information about families with the specific order G B G B B G. Without additional data, we cannot directly calculate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

However, we can use the concept of symmetry to make an educated guess. If the gender of the first child does not affect the probability of the subsequent children being boys or girls, then the order B G B B B B should be as likely as G B G B B B G.

In the G B G B B G B case, there are 3 boys and 3 girls. If we switch the first and last children, we get a family with 3 boys and 3 girls as well, but with the order B G B B B B. This means that if there are X families with the order G B G B B G, then there should be approximately X families with the order B G B B B B as well.

Therefore, based on the symmetry argument, we estimate that there are around 45 families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B.

{answer: 45}
