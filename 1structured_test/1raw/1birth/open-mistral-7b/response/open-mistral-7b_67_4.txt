To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the actual data is not provided. One reasonable assumption could be that the gender distribution among children is roughly equal, meaning approximately half boys and half girls. This assumption is based on the fact that in most societies, the gender ratio at birth is around 1.05 boys for every girl.

Given this assumption, let's consider the order of births for boys (B) and girls (G) in a family with six children:

1. If the order is B G B B B B, this means that there are 3 boys and 3 girls.
2. If the order is B G B B B G, this means that there are 4 boys and 2 girls.

Since we assume an equal gender distribution, it is more likely that families have an equal number of boys and girls. Therefore, we can say that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is less likely than families with the order B G B B B G.

However, without more specific data, we cannot provide an exact estimate of the number of families with the order B G B B B B. To get a more accurate estimate, further statistical analysis or additional data would be necessary.

{answer: Cannot provide an exact estimate. An estimate can be made based on the assumption of equal gender distribution, but more specific data is required for a definitive answer.}
