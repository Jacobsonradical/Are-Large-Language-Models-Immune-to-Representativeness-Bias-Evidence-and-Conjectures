To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations. Since there are 6 children and 2 genders (B for boys and G for girls), we have a total of 6! (6 factorial) possible orders.

The order we're interested in, B G B B B B, has 6 boys and no girls, or 6 B's. So, there are C(6, 6) ways to arrange 6 B's. According to the formula for combinations, C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), C(6, 6) = 1.

However, we also need to consider the order of the girls. There are C(6, 0) ways to arrange 0 girls, which is equal to 1. So, the total number of ways to arrange 6 boys and 0 girls is C(6, 6) * C(6, 0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Now, we know that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G. Since we've found that there is only 1 way to arrange 6 boys in the order we're interested in, we can estimate that the remaining families with the order B G B B B B are 45 - 1 = 44 families.
