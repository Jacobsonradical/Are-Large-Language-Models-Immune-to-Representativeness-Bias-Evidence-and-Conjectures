I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand the concept and provide an answer based on basic principles.

The question asks for the number of families with six children in the exact order of birth B (boy) and G (girl) as B G B B B B. Since the gender of the first child is a boy, there are only two ways to arrange the remaining five children with one boy and four girls: B G B B B B and B G B B B G.

There were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and we found two possibilities for the order B G B B B B or B G B B B G. Therefore, the number of families with the order B G B B B B is half the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

So, your estimate would be:
{answer: 45 / 2 = 22.5}

However, since the number of families must be a whole number, you can round down to 22 families with the order B G B B B B.
