I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or have real-time data. However, I can help you understand the concept and provide an educated guess based on assumptions.

In this case, we're looking for families with six children, all boys (B) or all girls (G), and we know the order for boys and girls being G B G B B G.

Since we don't have information about the number of families with all boys or all girls, I'll assume there's an equal likelihood of having either gender for each child (which is not necessarily true in real life).

If the order of boys and girls is fixed as G B G B B G, then it means the first child is a girl, the second is a boy, and so on. Given the equal likelihood of having boys or girls, each family has a 1/2 chance of having a girl as the first child.

If the first child is a girl, then the remaining five children can be arranged in five positions (B or G). The number of ways to arrange five things (boys or girls) in five positions is given by the factorial function, which for five items is 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Since the order of boys and girls is fixed, the second child must be a boy, and the remaining four positions can be filled with three boys and two girls or four boys and one girl. The number of ways to arrange three boys and two girls is C(5,3) × C(3,2) = 10 × 3 = 30, and the number of ways to arrange four boys and one girl is C(5,4) × C(1,1) = 5 × 1 = 5.

So, for each family with a girl as the first child, there are 30 + 5 = 35 ways to arrange the remaining five children. Since there's a 1/2 chance of having a girl as the first child, the expected number of families with this order is 1/2 × 35 = 17.5, which can be rounded up or down to 18 families.

However, we already know there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G. This means there should be an equal number of families with the order B G B G B G. So, our estimate is:

{answer: 18 families}

Again, this is an estimate based on an assumption of equal likelihood of having boys or girls for each child, which is not necessarily true in real life.
