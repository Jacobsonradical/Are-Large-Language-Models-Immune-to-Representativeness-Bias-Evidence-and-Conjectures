I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem if you were to do the survey yourself.

The question asks for the number of families with six children in the exact order of births B (boy) and G (girl) as B G B B B G. The number of families with this specific order is not given in the information provided.

To estimate this, you could look at the problem from a different angle. Since there are more ways to arrange boys and girls if some are interchangeable, the number of families with all boys or all girls first (or any other specific order) will be less than families with mixed genders.

So, if the number of families with the specific order B G B G B G is 45, and we assume there are roughly as many families with B B G G G G as with B G B G B G (which is not necessarily true), then the number of families with all boys first would be less than half of 45.

Therefore, your estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B B B B B B could be less than 22.5, but since the number of families must be a whole number, your best estimate might be 22.
