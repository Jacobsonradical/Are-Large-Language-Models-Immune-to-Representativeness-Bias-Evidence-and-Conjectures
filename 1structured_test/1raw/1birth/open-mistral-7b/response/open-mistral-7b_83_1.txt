I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the necessary data.

The question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. Since we know that in 45 families, the order was Girl Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl, we can infer that the order Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Boy is less common.

The number of children in both orders is the same, but the number of ways to arrange six children into two groups of three (one group for GBBBBG and another for BBBBBG) and six distinct groups (one for each family) is different.

For GBBBBG, there are 2 ways to arrange the groups (G first or B first), and 6 ways to arrange the three boys within the first group and the three girls within the second group. So, there are 2 * 6 = 12 ways to have GBBBBG.

For BBBBBG, there are 6 ways to arrange the groups (B first in each group), and 3 ways to arrange the four boys within the first group and the two girls within the second group. So, there are 6 * 3 = 18 ways to have BBBBBG.

Since the total number of families surveyed is 45, and we know there are 12 families with GBBBBG, we can estimate that there are 45 - 12 = 33 families with BBBBBG.

However, this is just an estimate, as it assumes that the order doesn't affect the family's likelihood of being surveyed, which may not be true. To get a more accurate estimate, you would need to conduct a more comprehensive survey.
