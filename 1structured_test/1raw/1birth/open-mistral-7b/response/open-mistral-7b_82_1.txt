To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probability. However, since we only have data for the order G B G B B G, we don't have enough information to provide an exact number.

But we can make an educated guess based on symmetry. If the order B G B B B B is less common than G B G B B G, it's likely because there are more girls than boys or an equal number of boys and girls, but the boys are born earlier.

However, if we assume that boys and girls are born at equal rates, we can expect the order of births to be symmetric. In this case, the order B G B B B B should be as common as G B G B B G.

So, based on this assumption, we can estimate that there are around 45 families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B.

{answer: 45 families (estimate)}
