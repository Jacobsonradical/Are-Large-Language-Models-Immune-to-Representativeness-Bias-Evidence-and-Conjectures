I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families where the exact order of births is Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy. Let's call this order "B G B B B G".

To estimate this number, we would need to know the total number of families with six children and the number of families with the order "G B G B B G", which is given as 45.

The total number of permutations of six distinct objects (in this case, six children) is given by the formula n!, where n is the number of objects. For six children, this is 6! = 720.

However, half of these permutations will involve the first child being a girl (G), and half will involve the first child being a boy (B). This means that there are 360 permutations with the first child as a boy (B), and 360 permutations with the first child as a girl (G).

Out of these 360 permutations starting with a boy, there are 240 that fit the order B G B B B G (since there are 4 choices for the position of the second child, 3 choices for the third child, and so on).

So, to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B G, we would divide the number of favorable permutations by the number of total permutations starting with a boy:

{answer: 240}

This is an estimate because we're assuming that the families are equally likely to have any of the 720 possible orders of birth. In reality, families might be more or less likely to have certain orders due to factors such as gender preferences, fertility treatments, or birth complications.
