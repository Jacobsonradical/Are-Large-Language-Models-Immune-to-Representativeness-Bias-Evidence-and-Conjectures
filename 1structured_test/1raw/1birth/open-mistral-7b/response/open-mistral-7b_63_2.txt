I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for the number of families with six children in which the exact order of births is Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy. This is a specific arrangement of boys and girls and there are 6! (factorial) ways to arrange six objects (in this case, boys and girls).

The arrangement you've given, G B G B B G, is just one of the ways to arrange B's and G's, so there must be other ways with B's first.

The number of ways to arrange B's and G's with B's first is 5! (factorial) for the positions of the girls and then choosing where to place the first boy, which can be done in 6 ways. So, the total number of ways to arrange the B's and G's with B's first is 5! * 6.

Now, we know that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G. This means there are fewer families with the order B G B B B B. So, the number of families with the order B G B B B B should be less than 45.

However, without knowing the actual number of families with the order G B G B B B G, I can't provide a specific estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B G. You would need to subtract the number of families with the order B G B B B B G from the number of families with the order G B G B B B G to find out.
