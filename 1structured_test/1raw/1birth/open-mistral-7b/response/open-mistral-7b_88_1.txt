To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the survey only provides information about families with a specific order of births (G B G B B G). Without more data, we cannot directly calculate the number of families with a different order of births.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the assumption that the gender distribution in births is roughly equal. This assumption is often used in probability problems when there is no specific information available.

If we assume that the gender distribution is 50% boys and 50% girls, then the probability of having a boy first and a girl second is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4. Similarly, the probability of having a girl first and a boy second is also 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

Since the order of births is symmetric (B G is the same as G B), we can multiply the probability of having a boy first by the number of boys to find the number of families with this order of births.

So, if there are 6 children in each family, the number of families with the first birth being a boy is the number of families times the probability of a boy first, which is 6 families * (1/4) = 1.5 families. However, since we cannot have half a family, we round this number up to 2 families.

Since the order of births is symmetric, there should also be 2 families with the first birth being a girl.

Therefore, under the assumption of equal gender distribution, there should be a total of 2 + 2 = 4 families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.
