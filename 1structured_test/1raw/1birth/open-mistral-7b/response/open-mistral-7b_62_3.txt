To answer this question, we'll assume that the gender of a child is random and independent of the genders of the other children in the same family. Since each family has six children, there are a total of 2^6 = 64 possible orders of birth (assuming boys and girls are equally likely).

We know that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G. This means there are 64 - 45 = 19 other possible orders of birth.

One of these other orders is B G B B B B, so our estimate is 1 (since we're only interested in an estimate, not an exact count).
