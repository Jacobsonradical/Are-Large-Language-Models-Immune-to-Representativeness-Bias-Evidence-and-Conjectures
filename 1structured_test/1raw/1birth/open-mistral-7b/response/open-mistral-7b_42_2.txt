Given that the survey only provides information about families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G, we cannot make an estimate for the number of families with the order of births as B G B B B B, as this information was not provided in the data.

However, to give a hypothetical answer, we could assume that the distribution of birth orders between boys and girls is not significantly biased. If this is the case, we could expect a similar number of families with the B G B B B B order as there are with the G B G B B G order.

{answer: Approximately the same number of families as those with the order G B G B B G (45 families)}

Please note that this is a speculative answer, and without more information, a precise estimate cannot be given.
