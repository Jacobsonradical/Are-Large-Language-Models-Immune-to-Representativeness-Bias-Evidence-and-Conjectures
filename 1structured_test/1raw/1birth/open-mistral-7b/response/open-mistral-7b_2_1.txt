I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to perform real-time surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl (B G B B B G).

Since we know the number of families with the order G B G B B G as 45, we can try to find a way to switch some of the boys and girls in that order to get the desired order.

If we switch the first and second child in the order G B G B B G, we get B G B B B G. However, this is not a new order because it can be obtained from the original order by switching two children. So, we cannot count this as a new family.

Therefore, we need to find a way to get the order B G B B B B without using any switches that we've already used. This is not possible with the given information.

So, based on the information provided, it appears that there are no additional families with the desired order of births. However, it's important to note that this is an assumption made based on the given information, and the actual number could be different if more information about the families was available.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format would be:
{answer: 0} (or possibly more, but the information provided does not allow us to make that estimate)
