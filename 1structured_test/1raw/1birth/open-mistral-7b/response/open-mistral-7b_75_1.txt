I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly survey or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

The question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl, which can be denoted as B G B B B G.

To find an estimate for the number of families with this birth order, you would need to know the total number of families with six children and the number of families with the specific G B G B B G order. Unfortunately, the question only provides the number of families with the G B G B B G order.

Since the order of births for boys and girls doesn't matter (BBGG or BGBBBG are the same if we're only considering the gender of the children), we can make an assumption that the number of families with the B G B B B G order should be the same as the number of families with G B G B B B G, given that the total number of families doesn't change.

However, without the total number of families, I'm unable to provide a specific number for the estimate. So, the answer would be:

{answer: I cannot provide a specific number without the total number of families surveyed.}
