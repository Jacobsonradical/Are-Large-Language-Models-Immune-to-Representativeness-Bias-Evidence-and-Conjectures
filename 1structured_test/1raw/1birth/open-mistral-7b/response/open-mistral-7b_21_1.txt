To answer this question, we need to make an assumption as there is not enough information to determine an exact number. A reasonable assumption would be that the order of births is random for each family, and the gender of a child is also random (50% chance of being a boy or a girl).

Given that there are two possible orders for boys and girls (B G B B B B and G B G B B B), and assuming that the order of births is independent of the gender of the children, we can estimate that each order will occur in half of the families with six children.

Since there are 2 possible orders and 45 families with one order (G B G B B G), we can estimate that the other order (B G B B B B) will occur in 45 families / 2 = {answer: 22.5 families}.

However, since we cannot have half a family, this estimate should be interpreted as an indication that the true number could be around 22 families, but it might be slightly more or less due to the assumptions made.
