To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations. The order of births for six children can be arranged in 6! (factorial) ways.

For the order B G B B B B, there are 6 positions for the boys (B) and 6 positions for the girls (G), and we want to place 3 boys and 3 girls in a specific order. Since the gender does not matter, we can treat this as a problem of arranging 3 distinguishable objects (boys) and 3 indistinguishable objects (girls) in a line.

The number of ways to arrange 3 distinguishable objects is 3! = 6, and the number of ways to arrange 3 indistinguishable objects is C(6, 3) = 20 (number of combinations). Multiplying these two values gives us the total number of ways to arrange boys and girls such that the order of boys is B G B B B B:

Total arrangements = 6 (distinguishable boys) * C(6, 3) (indistinguishable girls)
                                 = 6 * 20
                                 = 120

Now we know that the exact order of births B G B B B B can occur in 120 ways. However, we only know that 45 families have the order G B G B B G. To find out how many families have the order B G B B B B B, we can subtract the number of families with the order G B G B B G from the total number of ways to arrange the boys and girls with the desired order:

Number of families with B G B B B B B = Total arrangements - Number of families with G B G B B G
                                                      = 120 - 45
                                                      = 75

So, our estimate is that there are 75 families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B B.
