I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect real-world data. However, I can help explain how you might estimate this.

The question gives us information about 45 families with a specific order of births (G B G B B G). To estimate the number of families with a different order (B G B B B B), we could assume that the order of births is random and equally likely.

In a family of six children, there are 720 different ways to arrange the order of boys (B) and girls (G). If we assume that the order of births is random, then we would expect each arrangement to occur equally often.

However, the question only gives us information about one arrangement (G B G B B G), so we can't make a direct comparison. To estimate the number of families with the opposite arrangement (B G B B B B), we could subtract the number of families with the given arrangement (G B G B B G) from the total number of arrangements.

So, the estimate would be:

{answer: 720 (total arrangements) - 45 (families with G B G B B G) = approximately 675 families with B G B B B B.}
