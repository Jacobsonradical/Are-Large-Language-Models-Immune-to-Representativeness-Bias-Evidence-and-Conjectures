I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

In this case, you're looking for families with six children where the order of birth is Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Boy, Girl. This is one specific permutation of six boys and girls.

To find out how many families have this exact order, you would subtract the number of families with the opposite order (Girl, Boy, Girl, Boy, Boy, Boy) from the total number of families with six children.

However, without the data on the number of families with the opposite order, I can't provide a specific number. You would need that information to calculate the difference. So, my answer would be:

{answer: I cannot provide a specific number without knowing the number of families with the opposite order of births.}
