I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem if you had the data.

The question asks for the number of families where the exact order of births is Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy. Let's call this pattern B G B B B G.

Now, let's consider the pattern with the exact opposite order, which is Girl, Boy, Girl, Boy, Boy, Boy, and let's call this pattern G B G B B B G.

Since there are 6 children in each family, there are a total of 7 possible positions for the first birth (boy or girl). After placing the first child, there are 6 remaining positions for the second child, and so on.

Therefore, the number of families with the B G B B B G pattern is equal to the number of families with the G B G B B B G pattern.

To find the number of families with either pattern, we can calculate the number of ways to place 3 boys and 3 girls in 6 positions, without considering the order. This is a combinatorics problem, which can be solved using the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.

In this case, n = 6 (total children) and k = 3 (number of boys). So, the number of families with either pattern is C(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20 families.

However, since we want an estimate, we should multiply this number by a factor to account for potential errors. Without any specific data to base this on, a reasonable estimate might be to multiply the number of families by 1.5, giving an estimated number of 30 families with either pattern.

Therefore, your estimate should be:
{answer: 30 families}
