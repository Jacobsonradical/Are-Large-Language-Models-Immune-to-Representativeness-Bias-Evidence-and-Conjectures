I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

First, let's consider the total number of ways to arrange 6 children, regardless of gender. This is a permutation problem with 6 items, which can be calculated as 6! (factorial), which equals 720.

Now, let's consider the arrangement of boys and girls where there are more boys than girls (which is the case here, as there are 6 children and only 5 "slots" for girls). The first boy must be placed in any of the 6 positions. After placing the first boy, there are 5 slots left for 5 girls and 1 boy. This can be calculated as 6 * C(5+1-1, 5), where C(n, r) is the combination function. The result is 6 * C(6, 5) = 6 * 720 = 43,200.

However, we need to consider that we're looking for arrangements where the exact order is B G B B B B. So, the number of arrangements that we're interested in is the number of arrangements with 6 boys first, followed by 0 girls, then 4 girls, then 1 boy, and finally 0 girls. This can be calculated as C(6, 6) * C(0, 0) * C(4, 4) * C(1, 1) * C(0, 0) = 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.

So, there is 1 family with a total of 6 children with the exact order of births as B G B B B B.

To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can assume that the probability of each family having this order is equal to the calculated probability of this order. Therefore, your estimate would be the number of families surveyed (45) multiplied by this probability (1 / 720).

However, without knowing the actual number of families surveyed, I cannot provide the exact estimate. The estimate would be: {answer: 45 / 720}.
