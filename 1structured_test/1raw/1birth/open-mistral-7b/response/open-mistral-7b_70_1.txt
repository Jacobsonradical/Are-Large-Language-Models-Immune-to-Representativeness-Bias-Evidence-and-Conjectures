To answer this question, we need to make an assumption due to the lack of specific information. Since the question only mentions the order of births for families with six children and the gender of each child, we can assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50% each).

Given this assumption, let's analyze the given order of births (G B G B B G) for families with six children:

1. There are 5 positions for the first boy (B) to appear, which means there are 5C1 = 5 ways to have the first birth as a boy.
2. After the first boy, there are 4 positions for the second boy (B) to appear, which means there are 4C1 = 4 ways to have the second birth as a boy.
3. Similarly, the third and fourth boys (B) can appear in 3C1 and 2C1 ways, respectively.
4. Finally, the last birth must be a girl (G), which has only 1 way to occur.

Using the multiplication principle, the total number of ways to have the given order of births (G B G B B G) is:

5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 ways

We know that 45 families have this order of births. To find the number of families with the opposite order (B G B B B B G), we can subtract the number of families with the given order from the total number of ways to have six children with two boys and four girls (C(6, 2) = 15 ways):

15 (total ways) - 45 (families with G B G B B G) = 10 families

Since the question asks for an estimate of the number of families with the order B G B B B B G, we can make a reasonable assumption that the number of families with the opposite order is also around 10 families.

{answer: around 10 families}
