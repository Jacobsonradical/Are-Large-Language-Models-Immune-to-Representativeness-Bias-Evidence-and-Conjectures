Given that the data provided only tells us about families with the order of births as G B G B B G, we cannot make a direct comparison or estimate for the number of families with the order of births as B G B B B B. However, if we assume that the gender distribution in births is relatively equal (50% boys and 50% girls), we could potentially infer that there might be an equal number of families with the order B G B B B B as there are with the order G B G B B G.

However, this is just an assumption and without further information, a precise estimation cannot be made.
