To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use probabilistic reasoning based on the given information.

The probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) as the first birth is equal (since the sex of the baby is determined at conception and not influenced by the previous births).

After the first birth, the probability of having a boy or a girl for the second birth remains the same (50%).

Continuing this logic, the probability of having six boys in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64.

Similarly, the probability of having six girls in a row is also 1/64.

Since the order of boys and girls does not matter, the probability of having six boys or six girls in a row is the same, i.e., 1/64.

Now, we know that there are 45 families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G. Since this order contains three girls and three boys, there should be an equal number of families with six boys and six girls in this exact order.

So, if the probability of having six boys in a row is 1/64, then the number of families with six boys in a row (and hence six girls in a row) is the total number of families multiplied by this probability.

However, since we only know the number of families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G, we cannot directly calculate the total number of families.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific estimate for the number of families with six boys in a row (or six girls in a row) based on the given information.
