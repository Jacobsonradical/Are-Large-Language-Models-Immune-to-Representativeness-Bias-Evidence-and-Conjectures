In this problem, we are given the information about the order of births of boys (B) and girls in 45 families being G B G B B G. However, we are asked to estimate the number of families where the order is B G B B B B.

Since the gender of the children does not affect the number of families with a specific birth order, the number of families with order B G B B B B should be equal to the number of families with order G B G B B G, which is given as 45.

So, our estimate is:
{answer: 45}
