I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

To find the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations.

First, let's consider all the families with six children. We have two types of children: boys (B) and girls (G). The total number of ways to arrange six children is given by the formula for permutations: n!, where n is the number of items (in this case, six children).

Now, let's consider the families with the order of births as G B G B B B. The first child must be a girl, so we have five remaining children to arrange. The number of ways to arrange these five children is (5!).

Since the order of boys and girls doesn't matter in this case (a boy followed by a girl is the same as a girl followed by a boy), we can divide the number of families with the order G B G B B B by 2 to get the number of unique arrangements.

However, we counted the families with the order B G B B B B twice in our initial calculation of all possible arrangements, so we need to subtract that number.

So, the number of families with the order B G B B B B is equal to the total number of families minus the number of families with the order G B G B B B divided by 2.

But we don't have the total number of families in the city. So, I can't provide an exact answer, but I hope this helps you understand how to approach the problem.

{answer: I cannot provide an exact answer as I don't have the total number of families in the city}
