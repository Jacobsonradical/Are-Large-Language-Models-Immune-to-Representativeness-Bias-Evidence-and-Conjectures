To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probabilities for permutations. First, let's calculate the probability of having six children with two girls and four boys in any order.

There are 6! (factorial) ways to arrange 6 children, which is 720. The number of ways to arrange 2 girls and 4 boys in any order is (2! * 4!) = 2 * 24 = 48.

So, the probability of having 6 children with 2 girls and 4 boys in any order is 48/720.

Now, let's find the number of ways to arrange 6 children in the specific order of B G B B B B. This is simply 1, as the boys and girls are in a fixed position.

So, the probability of having 6 children with the exact order of B G B B B B is 1 * (2 girls and 4 boys in any order) probability = 1 * (48/720) = 48/720.

However, we are interested in the estimate for the number of families with this specific order, not the probability. Since we cannot know the exact number of families, we can use the observed probability as an estimate.

{answer: 45 families (the number observed with the order G B G B B G) * (probability of the order B G B B B B B) = 45 * (48/720) â‰ˆ 4.5 families.}

To provide a more intuitive answer, we can say that there are approximately 5 families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, considering rounding and sampling variability in the survey. However, since the actual number of families must be a whole number, we should expect that there are actually fewer than 5 families with this exact birth order. The survey result of 45 families with the order G B G B B G suggests that this specific order is more likely to occur in families with six children than the order B G B B B B B.
