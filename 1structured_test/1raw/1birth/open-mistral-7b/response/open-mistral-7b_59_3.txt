To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the gender distribution in births. Without specific data, we can't make an exact estimate. However, in many populations, the ratio of boys to girls at birth is approximately 1.05:1, or 51% boys and 49% girls.

Given this assumption, let's calculate the probability of having six boys in a row. The probability of having a boy in a birth is 0.51, and the probability of having a girl is 0.49. The probability of having six boys in a row is (0.51)^6 ≈ 0.0117.

Now, let's calculate the probability of having six girls in a row. The probability of having a girl in a birth is 0.49, and the probability of having six girls in a row is (0.49)^6 ≈ 0.0018.

Since we're looking for families with the exact order of boys and girls being B G B B B B, we need to subtract the probability of having six girls in a row from the probability of having six boys in a row.

So, our estimate would be:

{answer: approximately 45 - 0.0018 * (total number of families) families}

However, without knowing the total number of families surveyed, we can't provide a specific number. You would need additional data to calculate the exact number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.
