To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations and make an assumption based on the given information.

The order of births for boys and girls can be represented as B_1 G_1 B_2 G_2 B_3 B_4 G_4, where the subscripts represent the positions of each child in the family.

For the given order (G B G B B G), there are 5 girls and 1 boy, making a total of 6 children. The number of ways to arrange 6 objects (children) in 6 positions is C(6, 6) = 1, which is not useful for our purpose.

However, if we want to find the number of ways to arrange the boys (B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4) and the girls (G_1, G_2, G_4) separately, we can use the formula for permutations with repetitions:

C(n + r - 1, r - 1)

where n is the number of unique objects (boys) and r is the number of repetitions of each type of object (boys and girls).

For boys, n = 4 and r = 1, so C(4 + 1 - 1, 1 - 1) = C(4, 0) = 1 (since there is only 1 way to arrange 0 distinct objects).

For girls, n = 3 and r = 2, so C(3 + 2 - 1, 2 - 1) = C(4, 1) = 4 (since there are 4 ways to arrange 2 distinct objects).

Since the order of boys and girls does not matter, we can multiply these two numbers to find the total number of ways to arrange the boys and girls:

1 * 4 = 4

But this seems to contradict the given information that there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G. The discrepancy arises because the given information does not provide any information about the sex of the first child.

To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can assume that the first child is a boy, which would make the order B G B B B G equivalent to the given order G B G B B G.

Since there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and we assumed that the first child is a boy, we can estimate that there are about 45 families with the order B G B B B B.
