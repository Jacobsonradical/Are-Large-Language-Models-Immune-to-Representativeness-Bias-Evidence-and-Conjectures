I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the necessary data.

In a family with six children, there are 720 different ways to arrange them (6!, factorial). Since we're interested in the exact order of boys (B) and girls (G), we'll consider two types of arrangements: those with an even number of boys and those with an odd number of boys.

1. Even number of boys (e.g., B B G G G G or B G B G B G): Half of these arrangements will have the boys first (B B G G G G or B G B G B G), and half will have the boys last (G B G B B G B or G B B G G B). So, for even number of boys, there are 360 arrangements with boys first and 360 arrangements with boys last.

2. Odd number of boys (e.g., B G B G G B or B G B G B): All these arrangements will have the boys first (B G B G G B or B G B G B).

Since we're only interested in families with an exact order of B and G, we can add the number of arrangements with an even number of boys where boys come first and the number of arrangements with an odd number of boys to get the total number of arrangements with the desired pattern.

The number of families with B G B G B G would be half of the total arrangements with an even number of boys where boys come first, as we count each family (e.g., B B G G G G or B G B G B G) twice in the total.

So, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B G would be:

{answer: half of the number of families with an even number of boys where boys come first}
