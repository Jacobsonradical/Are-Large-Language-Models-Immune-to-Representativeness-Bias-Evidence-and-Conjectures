Due to the lack of specific data about the gender distribution in families, it's not possible to provide an exact number for families with the exact order of births B G B B B B. However, since there are two possible gender combinations (BBBBBB, BGBGBG, BGBGBB, BGBBGB, BGBBGB, BBGBGB, BBGBBB, BBGGBB, BBGBBG, BBGGBB) for six children, and we know that one of them (G B G B B G) has been observed in 45 families, we can estimate the number of families with the other gender combination (B G B B B B) by subtracting the number of families with the known order from the total number of families surveyed.

Assuming the total number of families surveyed is N, we can write the equation:

Number of families with B G B B B B = N - Number of families with G B G B B G

Given that there are 45 families with G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with B G B B B B as follows:

{answer: N - 45}
