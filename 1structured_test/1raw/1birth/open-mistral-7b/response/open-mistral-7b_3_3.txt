To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can make an assumption based on the information given. Since the number of boys and girls is the same in each family (6 children), and the order of boys and girls is reversed in the first family (G B G B B G), it's reasonable to assume that for every family with the order G B G B B G, there should be another family with the order B G B B B B G.

Given that 45 families have the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that there are approximately 45 families with the order B G B B B B G.

{answer: 45}
