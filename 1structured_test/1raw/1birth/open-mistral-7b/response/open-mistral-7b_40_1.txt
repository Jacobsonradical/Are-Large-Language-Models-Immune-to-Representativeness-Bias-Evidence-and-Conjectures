To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the exact number of families with the specific order of births B G B B B B is not provided. One reasonable assumption would be to consider equal probability of boys and girls being born, as this is a common assumption in demographic studies.

Given that there are six children in each family, there are a total of 6! (factorial) ways to arrange them. The number of ways to arrange six children with exactly two boys and four girls is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n = 6 (total number of children), and r = 2 (number of boys).

The total number of ways to arrange six children with exactly two girls and four boys is also C(6, 2). Since we are assuming equal probability, we can consider that both configurations have the same probability.

Therefore, assuming equal probability, the estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is half the total number of families with the configuration C(6, 2), which is 15.

{answer: 15 families (estimate)}
