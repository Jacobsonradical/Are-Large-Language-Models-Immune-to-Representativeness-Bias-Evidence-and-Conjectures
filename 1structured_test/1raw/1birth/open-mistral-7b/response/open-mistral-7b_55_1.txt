To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probability and the fact that there are more ways to arrange girls before boys than boys before girls in a family.

Let's consider the total number of arrangements for six children, which is given by the formula for permutations: n! (n factorial), where n is the number of children. In this case, n=6.

The number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is 6! / (2! * 4!) = 180 / (2 * 24) = 5.

Now, let's consider the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. Since there are more ways to arrange boys before girls, we can expect that this number will be less than the first one. To estimate the number, we can assume that the excess of arrangements with girls before boys is distributed evenly between all the other birth orders.

Since there are 6! arrangements in total, and 5 of them have girls before boys, the remaining arrangements have boys before girls. So, the number of arrangements with boys before girls is 6! - 5 = 720 - 180 = 540.

If we assume that half of these arrangements have the birth order B G B B B B, then our estimate would be 540 / 2 = 270.

So, {answer: 270} is our estimate for the number of families surveyed with the exact order of births B G B B B B.
