I'm an AI, and I don't have real-time data or the ability to conduct surveys. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using basic combinatorics.

The order of births for 6 children can be represented as a permutation of the letters B (boy) and G (girl). For a sequence of 6 boys and girls, there are 6! (6 factorial) possible arrangements.

In the case you provided, the order is G B G B B G. Since there are 3 girls and 3 boys, we can first arrange the 3 girls in 3! ways, and then arrange the 3 boys in the remaining 3! positions.

The number of families with the order B G B B B B is the same as the number of families with the order B B B B B G, as they represent the same sequence from a different perspective.

So, the number of families with the order B G B B B B or B B B B B G is twice the number of families with the order G B G B B B G.

Unfortunately, we don't have the number of families with the order G B G B B B G to calculate this directly. To provide an estimate, we could assume that the distribution of boys and girls is roughly equal, which means that the number of families with each order should also be roughly equal.

If we assume this, then we might estimate that there are as many families with the order B G B B B B or B B B B B G as with the order G B G B B B G. In that case, the number of families with the order B G B B B B or B B B B B G would be half of the total number of families with the order G B G B B B G, which is 45 in this case.

So, under this rough assumption, we might estimate that there are approximately 45 / 2 = 22.5 families with the order B G B B B B or B B B B B G. However, since the number of families must be a whole number, this estimate is not meaningful. A more precise estimate would require more information.
