I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using basic combinatorics.

The order of births for boys (B) and girls (G) can be thought of as a sequence of six positions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) where each position can be filled by a B or a G.

The question asks for the number of families where the order is B G B B B B. This means that position 1 is a boy, position 2 is a girl, position 3 is a boy, and so on.

The total number of ways to arrange B and G in six positions is given by the binomial coefficient C(11, 6), which represents the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 11 (5 boys and 6 girls) to place the boys.

However, since we know that the first position is a boy, we only need to consider the 10 remaining positions to place the remaining 5 boys. So, the number of ways to arrange the 5 boys in these 10 positions is C(10, 5).

Now, to find the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the first boy with the number of ways to arrange the 5 boys:

Number of families = C(1, 1) * C(10, 5)

But, since the order of boys and girls does not matter, we need to divide this result by 2 to avoid double-counting:

Number of families = (1 * C(10, 5)) / 2

I hope this helps. Please note that you would need to calculate the binomial coefficients to find the exact number.
