I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. Since we know the number of families with the order Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl Boy (45 families), we can use that information to make an estimate.

There are two ways to rearrange the Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl Boy order to get the Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Girl Boy order: swap the first and fifth child or swap the second and sixth child. So, there should be twice as many families with Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Girl Boy order as there are with Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl Boy order.

Since we know there are 45 families with Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl Boy order, we can estimate that there should be approximately 45 * 2 = 90 families with Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Girl Boy order.

So, your estimate would be:
{answer: 90}
