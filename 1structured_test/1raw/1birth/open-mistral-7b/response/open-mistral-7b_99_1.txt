I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using combinatorics.

The order of births for six children can be represented as a permutation of the letters B (boy) and G (girl), where the number of B's and G's is always equal (6B's and 6G's in this case).

The order you provided, G B G B B G, is one possible arrangement of six boys and girls. The question asks for the number of families with the same exact order of births.

To find the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can apply the same combinatorics concept. The number of arrangements for six objects (B's and G's) with no restrictions is given by the formula for permutations, n!, where n is the number of objects. In this case, n = 6.

However, since we are looking for the number of arrangements with a specific order (B G B B B B), we can use the concept of a cyclic permutation. In this case, the order B G B B B B is equivalent to B_1 G_1 B_2 G_2 B_3 G_3 (where the subscripts 1, 2, 3 indicate different individuals), and both orders represent the same arrangement.

The number of cyclic permutations for six objects is given by the formula n! divided by the number of distinct objects, which is 6 in this case. So, the number of cyclic permutations is 6! / 6 = 5! = 120.

Since there is only one specific arrangement we're interested in (B G B B B B), the number of families with this exact order of births is 1.

However, your question asks for an estimate, which is a bit unclear in this context. If you meant to ask for an approximation due to the small sample size of 45 families, then my answer would be that we cannot make an accurate estimate based on 45 families. If you meant something else, please clarify.
