I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to perform real-time surveys or collect data. However, I can provide an analytical approach to solve this problem.

In a family of six children, there are several possible orders of birth for boys (B) and girls (G). One of these orders is B G B B B B.

Now, let's consider the order G B G B B G. This order is the reverse of the desired order B G B B B B. Since the order of birth does not matter for boys and girls (as long as we know their gender), we can assume that the number of families with the order G B G B B G is equal to the number of families with the order B G B B B B G (which is the same as the desired order B G B B B B with the last two children swapped).

Since we know that there are 45 families with the order of births as G B G B B G, we can assume that there are also 45 families with the order of births as B G B B B B G.

However, we want to find the number of families with the order B G B B B B B. Since each gender can take any position, we simply need to multiply the number of families with the order B G B B B G by 2 (to account for the swapping of the last two children).

So, your estimate would be:

{answer: 90}

This estimate assumes that the gender distribution in families is equal, i.e., there are as many boys as girls in the population. If this is not the case, the actual number may deviate from 90.
