To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the gender ratio in births, as the survey only provides information about one specific order of boy and girl births. Let's assume a common gender ratio of 1 boy to 1.1 girls (based on global averages).

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to arrange 6 children with this gender ratio. We'll start by counting the number of ways to arrange 6 boys (B) and then multiply it by the number of ways to arrange the girls (G) in the remaining spaces.

The number of ways to arrange 6 boys is C(6, 6) = 1.

The total number of girls is 6 * 1.1 = 6.6 ≈ 7 (rounding up to account for the extra girl).

So, the number of ways to arrange 7 girls is C(6, 1) * C(5, 6) = 6 * 720 = 4,320.

Now, we can find the total number of arrangements for 6 boys and 7 girls by multiplying these two values: 1 * 4,320 = 4,320.

However, since we are interested in the arrangement B G B B B B, we need to consider only the arrangements that start with a boy and end with a girl. This means we need to find the number of ways to place 5 girls between the initial boy and the final girl, which is C(6, 5) * C(5, 4) * 1 = 120 * 5 = 600.

Finally, we'll multiply this value by the number of arrangements for 6 boys and 7 girls that meet our condition: 4,320 * 600 = 2,592,000.

Now, we can find the percentage of families with the order B G B B B B by dividing this number by the total number of families surveyed (45) and then multiplying by 100: (2,592,000 / 45) * 100 ≈ 57,156,000%.

Since this percentage is much larger than 100, it's likely that our assumption about the gender ratio was incorrect. In such cases, it's best to acknowledge the limitation of the data and avoid making an estimate.

Therefore, I cannot provide an estimate in this format.
