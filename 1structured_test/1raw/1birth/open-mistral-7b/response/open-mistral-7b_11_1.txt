I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the necessary data.

The question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. Since we know the number of families with the order as Girl Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl, we can estimate the number of families with the reversed order by considering the fact that the gender of the children doesn't change the total number of boys and girls.

Given that there are 6 children in each family, there are 3 possible positions for the first boy (B). After placing the first boy, there are 2 remaining positions for the first girl (G). Then, there are 2 positions for the second boy, 2 for the second girl, and so on.

Since the order of births is reversed, the number of families with the order as Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl Girl should be equal to the number of families with the order as Boy Boy Girl Boy Girl Girl Boy.

So, if there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, there should be approximately 45 families with the order B G B G B G B.

Therefore, your estimate would be:
{answer: 45}
