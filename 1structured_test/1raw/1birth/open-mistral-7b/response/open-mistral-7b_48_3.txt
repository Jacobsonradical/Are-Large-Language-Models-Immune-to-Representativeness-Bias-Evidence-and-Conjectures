I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you reason about this problem.

In this case, the order of births is either Boy (B) or Girl (G). There are 2 types of orders: GBBBBBG and BGBGBGB.

1. For the order GBBBBBG, the first child is a girl, and the remaining five children are boys. There are C(6,5) = 6 ways to arrange the 5 boys after the first girl. Therefore, the number of families with this order is 6.

2. For the order BGBGBGB, the first child is a boy, and the remaining five children are either all boys or have one girl in between. There are C(5,1) = 5 ways to place the girl among the 5 boys, and C(4,4) = 1 ways to arrange the 4 boys after the girl. So, there are 5 * 1 = 5 families with this order.

Therefore, the total number of families with this exact order is 6 (for GBBBBBG) + 5 (for BGBGBGB) = 11 families.

However, the question asks for an estimate of the number of families with the order B G B B B B. Since the order of boys and girls is not specified in your question, I cannot provide an estimate for this order. I would need more information to make an estimate.
