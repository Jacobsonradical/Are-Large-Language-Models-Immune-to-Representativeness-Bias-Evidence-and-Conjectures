I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. Let's assume the sex of a child is random and independent of the sex of their siblings (which is a common assumption for these types of problems).

First, let's consider the case where the order is Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl Girl. The probability of this sequence is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64.

Now, let's consider the case where the order is Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Girl. This is the same as Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl Boy, but with the last two children swapped. So the probability of this sequence is also 1/64.

There are two sequences with 3 girls and 3 boys, so the total probability of these sequences is 1/64 + 1/64 = 2/64 = 1/32.

However, for each of these sequences, there is also a sequence with the girls first and boys second. So for each sequence with 3 girls and 3 boys, there are two sequences with the opposite order. Therefore, the actual number of families with 3 girls and 3 boys is twice the probability: 2 * (1/32) = 1/16.

So, if we assume that the order of births is random, we would estimate that 1/16 of the families surveyed would have the exact order of births as Boy Girl Boy Boy Girl Girl. However, the question asks for the number with the exact order of Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Boy Girl. Since this is the opposite of the first sequence we considered, there should be another 1/64 * 2 = 2/128 = 1/64 of families with this exact order.

Adding these two estimates together, our final estimate is:

{answer: 1/16 + 1/64} = 7/64

So, based on this assumption, we would estimate that 7/64 of the families surveyed had the exact order of births as Boy Girl Boy Boy Boy Boy Girl.
