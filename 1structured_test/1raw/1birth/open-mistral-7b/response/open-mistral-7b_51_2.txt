I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly survey or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

The order of births for six children can be represented as a sequence of six B's (boys) and G's (girls). There are 72 different ways to arrange 6 B's and 6 G's if the order matters (permutations).

If we want to find the number of families with the exact order of B G B B B G, we can subtract the number of families with the opposite order B B B B B G G (which is also a possible arrangement) from the total number of permutations.

The opposite order has 6 B's and 1 G in the first 6 positions, and 6 G's and 1 B in the last 6 positions. So, the number of families with this order is also 72 (permutations).

Therefore, the number of families with the desired order B G B B B G is 72 (total permutations) - 72 (opposite order families) = 0 families.

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the question, as 45 families were reported to have the order G B G B B G. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the question or the reported data.

So, based on the given data, it seems that the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is not 0, but the question or the reported data is inconsistent. To get a reliable estimate, you would need to check the data or the question for errors.
