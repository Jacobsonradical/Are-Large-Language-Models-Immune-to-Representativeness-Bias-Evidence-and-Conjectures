I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or gather data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for an estimate of the number of families where the exact order of births is B (boy) G (girl) B (boy) B (boy) B (boy). Since the total number of families with six children and the exact order of births as G B G B B G is given as 45, the number of families with the opposite order (B G B B B B) would be equal to the total number of families minus the number with the given order.

So, your estimate would be:
{answer: 45 - number of families with B G B G B B G}
