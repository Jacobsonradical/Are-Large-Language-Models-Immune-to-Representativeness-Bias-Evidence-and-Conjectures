To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probabilities. First, let's calculate the probability of having a boy (B) as the first-born child.

The probability of having a boy as the first-born is 1/2 (since the gender of a child is randomly determined and has two possible outcomes: boy or girl).

Next, since we already have a boy, the probability of having a girl (G) as the second-born child is 1/2 as well.

This pattern continues, so for the sixth child, the probability of having a girl is also 1/2.

To calculate the probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we multiply the probabilities of each event:

P(B G B B B B) = P(B) * P(G) * P(B) * P(B) * P(G) * P(B)
= (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2)
= 1/64

Now, we know that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G. To find an estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can assume that the probabilities of different birth orders are approximately equal.

So, we can estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B by multiplying the number of families with the order G B G B B G by the inverse probability of having that order:

Estimated number of families = Number of families with G B G B B G * (1/P(G B G B B G))
= 45 * (1/1/64)
= 45 * 64
â‰ˆ 2880

Thus, the estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is approximately 2880.
