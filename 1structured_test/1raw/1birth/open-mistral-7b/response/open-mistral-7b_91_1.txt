To answer this question, we need to make an assumption about the gender of children in families, as the survey data only provides information about the specific order of births for families with six children and that order being G B G B B G. Without more data, it's not possible to know the exact proportion of families with six children whose order of births is B G B B B B.

However, since there are two possible orders of birth for boys and girls (G B G B B G and B G B B B G), and we know that 45 families have the first order, we can estimate the number of families with the second order by assuming that the occurrence of each order is equal.

So, the number of families with the second order (B G B B B B) would be half of the families with the first order, which is 45 / 2 = 22.5.

Since the number of families must be a whole number, it's more reasonable to assume that the actual number of families with the second order is closer to 22 than 23. Therefore, our estimate is:

{answer: 22 families}
