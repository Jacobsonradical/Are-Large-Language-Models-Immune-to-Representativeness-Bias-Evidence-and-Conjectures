I'm an AI and don't have the capability to directly conduct surveys or analyze data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy. Since the genders of the children are the only distinguishing factor, we can treat this as a problem of permutations.

There are 2 types of children (B and G), and 6 positions for them. The number of ways to arrange 6 items of 2 types without repetition is given by the formula for permutations: P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items being arranged.

In this case, n = 6 (total children) and r = 6 (all positions are filled).

So, the number of ways to arrange boys and girls in any order is P(6, 6) = 6! / (6-6)! = 720.

Now, let's count the number of arrangements that have the specific order B G B B B G. We can do this by multiplying the number of ways to arrange the 4 boys by the number of ways to arrange the 2 girls, and then divide by the number of ways to arrange all 6 children:

Number of specific arrangements = P(4, 4) * P(2, 2) / P(6, 6)
                                            = 24 * 1 / 720
                                            = 1/30

Since there should be a whole number of families with this specific order, it's likely that the question has an error or missing information. If the question is intended to represent actual survey results, it would be expected that the specific order of births B G B B B G occurs in a whole number of families, not a fraction.

Therefore, I would recommend checking the question or the data source for any potential errors or omissions. If the question is correct as is, it may be an indication of a statistical anomaly or a very small sample size.
