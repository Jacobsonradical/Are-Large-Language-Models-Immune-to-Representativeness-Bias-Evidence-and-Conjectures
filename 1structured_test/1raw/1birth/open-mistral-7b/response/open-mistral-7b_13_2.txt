I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem using probability.

In a family of six children, there are several ways to arrange boys (B) and girls (G). For the arrangement B G B B B G, there are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange the 5 non-identical elements (3 boys and 2 girls).

Similarly, for the arrangement B G B B B B, there are 6! ways to arrange the 6 children.

The total number of ways to arrange 6 children is 6!.

So, the probability of having a family with the exact order B G B B B G is the number of ways to arrange B G B B B B divided by the total number of ways to arrange 6 children:

P(B G B B B B G) = Number of ways (B G B B B B) / Total number of ways
                            = 5! / 6!

However, the question asks for an estimate of the number of families with this exact order, not the probability. Since the survey results are not available, it's not possible for me to provide an exact estimate.

To make an educated guess, you could assume that the birth order patterns are equally likely, which would mean that the estimated number of families with the B G B B B B G order would be the same as the probability:

{answer: 5! / 6! * Total number of families surveyed}

Please note that this is just an estimate based on the assumption that all birth order patterns are equally likely, and the actual number could be different. The survey results would be needed to get a more accurate estimate.
