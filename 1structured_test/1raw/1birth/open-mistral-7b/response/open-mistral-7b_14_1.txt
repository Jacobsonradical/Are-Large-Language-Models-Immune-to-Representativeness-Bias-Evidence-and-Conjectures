I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand the problem and provide an answer based on certain assumptions.

To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations in combinatorics. A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. In this case, the objects are six positions (for the six children), and two types of objects (boys and girls).

First, let's find out how many possible orders of birth exist for six children. This is a permutation of six items taken six at a time, which is represented as 6! (6 factorial).

Now, let's find out how many orders of birth result in at least one boy appearing first. This is equal to the number of permutations of five boys and one girl, which is represented as 5! * 6 (since the first position can be any one of the six children).

Next, let's consider the order B G B B B B. This order has one boy (B) followed by five girls (G), and then the same order of B's and G's repeats. Since there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can assume that half of these families have the exact order B G B B B B, as the order can be flipped around (B G B B B B becomes B B B B B G).

So, our estimate would be:

{answer: 45 / 2 = 22.5}

However, since the number of families cannot be a fraction, we can round up or down based on additional assumptions or information about the data. Without more information, a reasonable estimate would be 23 families.
