I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem.

The question asks for the number of families with six children where the exact order of births is Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Boy, Girl. This is a specific permutation of six elements (B and G) with two distinct types.

Permutations of n distinct elements taken r at a time is calculated as n! / (n-r)!, where '!' denotes factorial. In this case, n = 6 (boys and girls) and r = 6 (all six children).

However, the question asks for the number of permutations where the exact order is Boy, Girl, Boy, Boy, Boy, Girl. This is a specific arrangement within the total permutations.

To find the number of specific arrangements, we can use the concept of combinations. Combinations of n distinct elements taken r at a time is calculated as n! / (r! * (n-r)!). In this case, r = 6 (all six children) and we want to find the number of ways to arrange these six elements such that the first element is a boy, the second is a girl, the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth are boys. So, the number of specific arrangements is the number of combinations of 6 boys and 1 girl taken 6 at a time, which is calculated as C(6,1) = 6! / (1! * 5!) = 6.

Therefore, if there are a total of n families with six children, the number of families with the specified birth order is 6 (specific arrangements) multiplied by the number of families with six children (n).

So, your estimate would be {answer: 6 * n}. Please replace 'n' with the actual number of families surveyed that have six children.
