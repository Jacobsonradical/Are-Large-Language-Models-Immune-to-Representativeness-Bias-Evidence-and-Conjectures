To answer this question, we need to make an assumption since the information provided does not allow us to make a definitive conclusion. One reasonable assumption is that the gender of the first child is not influenced by the genders of the subsequent children. Under this assumption, the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) as the first child is equal (0.5).

Once the first child is born, the probability of having a boy or a girl as the second child is also 0.5, independent of the gender of the first child. This pattern continues for all five subsequent births.

Given the assumption, the number of ways to arrange five boys (B) and one girl (G) in a row is the same as arranging five girls and one boy. This is because the order of the boys and girls does not matter (it's just a matter of labeling). The number of ways to arrange six items in a row is 6! (factorial), which equals 720.

Similarly, the number of ways to arrange five girls and one boy is also 720.

Since the probabilities are equal, we would expect an equal number of families with the arrangement B G B B B B and families with the arrangement G B G B B B. Therefore, our estimate is that there are approximately 45 families with the arrangement G B G B B B.

{answer: 45 families}

However, please note that this is an estimate based on an assumption, and the actual number could be different. It would require more precise data to make a definitive conclusion.
