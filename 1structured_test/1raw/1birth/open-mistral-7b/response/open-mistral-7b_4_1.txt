I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem theoretically.

The question asks for the number of families with six children in the exact order of births as Boy (B) Girl (G) Boy Boy Girl Girl. We know the number of families with the order of G B G B B G is 45.

Since the order of the boys and girls can be reversed without changing the family (e.g., B G B B B G is the same as G B B G B B G), we can double the number of families with the G B G B B G order to find the number of families with the B G B B B G order.

Therefore, your estimate would be:
{answer: 2 * 45 = 90}

However, this estimate does not account for families with different orders of boys and girls. To get a more accurate estimate, a larger survey would be needed.
