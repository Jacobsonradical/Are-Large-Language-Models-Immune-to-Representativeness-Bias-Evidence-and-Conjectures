I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

In this case, the question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy, Boy, Girl, Boy. This order has 6 positions, and there are 2 types of children (Boy and Girl). Since the order is fixed, we can treat each position as having 2 possible choices: Boy or Girl.

So, the total number of ways to arrange 6 children with 2 choices for each position is the number of permutations of 6 items taken 6 times, which is 6! / (6-6)! = 6! = 720.

However, since we're interested in the arrangement G B G B B G, which has 3 boys and 3 girls, we need to find the number of ways to arrange 3B and 3G. This can be calculated using combinations, which is the number of ways to choose 3 items from a set of 6 (for boys) and 3 items from a set of 6 (for girls).

The number of ways to choose 3B out of 6B is C(6,3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!) = 20.
The number of ways to choose 3G out of 6G is also C(6,3) = 20.

Since the order of boys and girls is fixed, we can multiply the number of ways to choose 3B by the number of ways to choose 3G to get the total number of arrangements with 3B and 3G. This is 20 * 20 = 400.

However, the question asks for the number of families with the exact order G B G B B G. Since the gender of the first child is a girl, we need to subtract the number of families with the order B G B B B G (which has 3 girls and 3 boys), as this would be counted twice in the previous calculation.

Since the number of ways to choose 3B out of 6B is the same as the number of ways to choose 3G out of 6G, the number of families with the order B G B B B G is also 400.

So, to get the number of families with the order G B G B B G, we subtract 400 from the total number of arrangements with 3B and 3G: 400 - 400 = 0.

This result doesn't make sense in the real world, which means there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my interpretation of it. If the problem statement is correct, then it's not possible to have any families with the exact order G B G B B G based on the information given.

Therefore, I would recommend checking the problem statement or asking for clarification if possible.
