I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to directly conduct surveys or observe real-world data. However, I can help you understand how you might approach this problem.

To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations. The order of births for six children can be represented as a permutation of six letters (B for boy and G for girl).

For the given order (G B G B B G), the number of permutations for six letters where the number of 'B' is less than or equal to the number of 'G' is given by the combination C(n+r-1, r-1) where n is the number of 'G' and r is the number of 'B'.

For the given order, n = 5 (number of girls) and r = 1 (number of boys). So, C(n+r-1, r-1) = C(5+1-1, 1-1) = C(5,0) = 1 (since there are no choices for the position of the boy in this order).

However, this count does not account for the order of the girls. For the same order of boys, there are 6! (factorial of 6) possible orders of girls, which would result in 6! families if the order of boys doesn't matter.

But since the order of boys is specified, there is only 1 possible order of girls for this case. So, the actual number of families with this order of births would be 1 (the single possible order of girls) times the count we calculated, which is 1.

So, your estimate would be {answer: 1}. However, it's important to note that this is an estimate based on a simplified model and may not account for all possible variations or factors in real-world data.
