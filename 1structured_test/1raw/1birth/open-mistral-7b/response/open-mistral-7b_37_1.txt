I'm an AI and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help explain how you might approach this problem if you had the data.

The number of ways to arrange 6 objects (boys or girls) into a line is given by the formula for permutations, which is n! (n factorial), where n is the number of objects. In this case, n = 6.

We know the order of births for boys and girls in one family: B G B B B G. This means that there are 5 boys and 1 girl. The number of ways to arrange 5 boys and 1 girl is 5! * 1! = 120 ways.

However, we're interested in the arrangement where all the boys come before the girl. In this case, we can treat the 5 boys as a single group and only consider the arrangement of this group and the girl. This is a combination problem, and the formula is C(n, r) = n! / [r! * (n-r)!], where C(n, r) is the number of combinations, n is the total number of objects, and r is the number of objects we want to choose at a time. In this case, n = 5 (the boys) and r = 1 (the girl).

So, the number of ways to arrange the 5 boys and the 1 girl is C(5, 1) = 5! / [1! * (5-1)!] = 5 ways.

Since each of these 5 arrangements represents a family where the exact order of births was B G B B B B, and we know there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that there are 5 * (number of families with B G B B B G) families with the order B G B B B B G.

Unfortunately, we don't have the number of families with the order B G B B B B G in the original survey. So, I can't provide a specific estimate for this number. But I hope this helps explain how you might approach the problem if you had the necessary data.
