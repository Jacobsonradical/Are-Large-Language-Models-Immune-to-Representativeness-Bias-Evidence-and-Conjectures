I'm an AI, and I don't have the ability to conduct real-world surveys or collect data. However, I can help you understand how to approach this problem if you had the data.

If we consider the order of births of boys (B) and girls (G) as events, and we're interested in the number of families where the exact order is B G B B B B, we can think of it as a permutation problem.

The total number of permutations for six elements (B and G, where B represents a boy and G represents a girl) is C(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!, where n=6 (total number of children) and r=6 (since all children are accounted for in the permutation).

The number of families with the exact order of B G B B B G is the number of permutations where the first, third, and fifth positions are filled with B, and the rest with G. This can be calculated as C(6, 1) * C(5, 3) * C(4, 2) = 6 * 60 * 12 = 1,296.

However, this counts each family multiple times if the gender of the children is different but the order of births is the same. To avoid double-counting, we need to divide the total number of permutations by the number of ways to distribute 6 boys among any 6 positions. This can be calculated as C(6, 6) = 1.

So, the number of unique families with this order is 1,296 / 1 = 1,296.

But since the question asks for an estimate, I would recommend a smaller number, considering that the survey might not have captured every family in the city. For example, you could consider an estimate of 80% of the families, so your answer would be {answer: 1,036.8}. This estimate assumes that missing families are evenly distributed and that the survey captures more of some types of families than others. Again, this is just an example and may not reflect the actual distribution of families in the city.
