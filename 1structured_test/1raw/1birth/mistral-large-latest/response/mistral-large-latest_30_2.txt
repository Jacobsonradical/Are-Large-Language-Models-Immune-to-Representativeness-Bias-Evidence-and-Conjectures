To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the specific sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the probability of this sequence occurring is the same as the probability of any other specific sequence, including B G B B B B.

Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B by multiplying the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G by the ratio of the probabilities of the two sequences. Since the probabilities are equal, the ratio is 1.

Thus, the estimate for the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:

\[
\text{Estimate} = 45 \times 1 = 45
\]

So, the answer is:
