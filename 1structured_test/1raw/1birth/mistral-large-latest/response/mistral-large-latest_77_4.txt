To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the specific sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is much larger, and the occurrence of any specific sequence should be approximately the same due to the law of large numbers.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should also be approximately 45, as the probability of each specific sequence occurring is the same.
