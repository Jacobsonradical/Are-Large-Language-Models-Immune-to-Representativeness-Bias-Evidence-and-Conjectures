To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the fact that each specific sequence of six children (e.g., G B G B B G) has an equal probability of occurring. Since there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six children (each child can be either a boy or a girl), each specific sequence has a probability of \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B by assuming that the number of families with each specific sequence is roughly the same.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is also 45.

\[
\boxed{45}
