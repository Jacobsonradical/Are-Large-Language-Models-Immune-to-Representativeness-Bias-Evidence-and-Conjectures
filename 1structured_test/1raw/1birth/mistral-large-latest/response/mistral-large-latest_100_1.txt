To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each specific sequence of six children is equally likely. Since there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families and then find the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B.

First, let's calculate the total number of possible sequences for six children. Each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), so there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences.

If each sequence is equally likely, the probability of any specific sequence occurring is \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (\(N\)) by:

\[ \frac{45}{64} = \frac{N}{64} \]

Solving for \(N\):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]

Now, we want to find the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. Since each sequence is equally likely, the expected number of families with this sequence is also \(\frac{1}{64}\) of the total number of families.

So, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:

\[ \frac{N}{64} = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
