To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the information given about the birth order G B G B B G. Since the probability of having a boy or a girl is assumed to be equal (1/2 for each), the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \((1/2)^6\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering that each specific sequence of six children is equally likely.

The probability of any specific sequence of six children is:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Since there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, the estimated total number of families surveyed (\(N\)) can be calculated as:
\[
N = 45 \times 64
\]

Now, we want to estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. Since each specific sequence is equally likely, the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should also be approximately the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]
