To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of a specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the likelihood of any specific sequence of six children is \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is much larger, but for simplicity, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B by assuming the same probability applies.

Thus, if 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B as follows:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = 45 \]

Therefore, the answer is:

\[ \{\text{answer: 45}\} \]
