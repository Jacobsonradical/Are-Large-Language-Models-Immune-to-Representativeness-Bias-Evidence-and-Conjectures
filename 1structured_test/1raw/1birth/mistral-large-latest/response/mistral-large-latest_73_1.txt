To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of a specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is large enough that the probability of any specific sequence occurring is uniformly distributed.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G, because each specific sequence of six children has the same probability of occurring.

Thus, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
