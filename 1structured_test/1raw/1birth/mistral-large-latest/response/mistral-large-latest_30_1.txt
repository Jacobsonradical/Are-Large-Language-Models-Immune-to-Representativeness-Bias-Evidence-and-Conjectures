To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the information given about the birth order G B G B B G. Since the probability of having a boy or a girl is assumed to be equal (1/2 for each), the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\).

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering that each specific sequence of six children is equally likely. Therefore, the total number of families surveyed can be estimated as:

\[ \text{Total families surveyed} = 45 \times 64 \]

Now, to find the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we use the same probability of \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\). Thus, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \text{Estimated families with B G B B B B} = \frac{\text{Total families surveyed}}{64} = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
