To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each specific sequence of six children is equally likely. Since there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families and then find the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B.

First, let's calculate the total number of possible sequences for six children. Each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), so there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences.

If each sequence is equally likely, the probability of any specific sequence occurring is \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (\(N\)) by:
\[ \frac{45}{64} = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]

Now, to find the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same probability:
\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 45 \times 64 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]
