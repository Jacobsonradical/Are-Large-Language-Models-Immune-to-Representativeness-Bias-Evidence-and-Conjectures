To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of each specific sequence occurring. Since the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is 0.5 for each child, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \((0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64}\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering that each specific sequence is equally likely. Therefore, the total number of families surveyed can be estimated as:

\[ \text{Total families} = 45 \times 64 \]

Now, to find the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same probability:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{\text{Total families}}{64} \]

Substituting the total families:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
