{answer: 45}

Explanation: The probability of a specific sequence of births (e.g., G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is the same for any given sequence of six children, as each child has an independent 50% chance of being a boy or a girl. Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, which is 45.
