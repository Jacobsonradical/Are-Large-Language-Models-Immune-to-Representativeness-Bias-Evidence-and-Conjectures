To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each unique sequence of six children is equally likely. Since the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can use this information to estimate the occurrence of the sequence B G B B B B.

There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six children (since each child can be either a boy or a girl). The probability of any specific sequence occurring is therefore \( \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by multiplying 45 by 64:

\[ \text{Total families surveyed} = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Since each sequence is equally likely, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is also \( \frac{1}{64} \) of the total number of families surveyed:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
