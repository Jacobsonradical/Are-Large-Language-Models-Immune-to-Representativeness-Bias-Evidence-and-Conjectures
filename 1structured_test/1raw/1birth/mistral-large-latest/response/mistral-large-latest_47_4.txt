To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of each specific sequence occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is large enough that the probability of each sequence occurring is uniformly distributed. Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B by assuming the same probability applies.

Since the probability of any specific sequence is \( \frac{1}{64} \), and we know there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B as follows:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = 45 \]

Thus, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
