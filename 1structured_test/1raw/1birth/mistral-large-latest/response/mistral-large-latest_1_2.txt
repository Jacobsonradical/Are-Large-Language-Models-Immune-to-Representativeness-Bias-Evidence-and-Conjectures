To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the specific sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering that each specific sequence (including G B G B B G) is equally likely to occur.

Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. The expected number of families with any specific sequence is \( N \times \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45 = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \( N \):
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Now, to find the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same probability:
\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]
