To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each unique sequence of six children is equally likely. Since the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can use this information to estimate the occurrence of the sequence B G B B B B.

There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six children (since each child can be either a boy or a girl). Assuming each sequence is equally likely, the probability of any specific sequence occurring is \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Given that the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by multiplying 45 by 64:

\[ \text{Total number of families} = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, since each specific sequence has an equal probability of \(\frac{1}{64}\), the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
