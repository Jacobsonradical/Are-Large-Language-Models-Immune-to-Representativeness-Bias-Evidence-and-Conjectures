To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each specific sequence of six children is equally likely. Since there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six children (each child can be either a boy or a girl), and we know that one specific sequence (G B G B B G) occurred in 45 families, we can estimate the number of families with any other specific sequence (such as B G B B B B) to be the same.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
