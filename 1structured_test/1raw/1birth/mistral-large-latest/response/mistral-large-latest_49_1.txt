To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of a specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy or a girl, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the probability of this sequence occurring is the same as the probability of any other specific sequence, including B G B B B B.

Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B as follows:

\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \text{Number of families with G B G B B G} = 45 \]

So, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
