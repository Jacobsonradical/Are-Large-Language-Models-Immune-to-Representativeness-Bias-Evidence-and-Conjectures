To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the information given about the birth order G B G B B G. The probability of any specific sequence of six children occurring is the same for any sequence, assuming each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl.

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B by considering the total number of possible sequences of six children.

The total number of possible sequences of six children (where each child can be either a boy or a girl) is \(2^6 = 64\).

Since each sequence is equally likely, the number of families with any specific sequence should be approximately the same. Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B to be the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G.

Thus, the estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
