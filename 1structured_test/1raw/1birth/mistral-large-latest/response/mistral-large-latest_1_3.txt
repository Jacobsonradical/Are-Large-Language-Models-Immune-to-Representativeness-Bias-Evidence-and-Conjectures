To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is large enough that each specific sequence is equally likely to occur. Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B to be the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G, which is 45.

Thus, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
