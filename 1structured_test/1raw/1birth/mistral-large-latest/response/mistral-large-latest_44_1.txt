To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is assumed to be 0.5 for each child, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( (0.5)^6 \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can infer that the probability of this specific sequence occurring is the same as the probability of any other specific sequence, including B G B B B B.

Therefore, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G, which is 45.

So, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
