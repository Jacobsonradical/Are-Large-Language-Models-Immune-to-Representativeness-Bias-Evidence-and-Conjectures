To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of a specific sequence of births occurring. Since the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is approximately 0.5 for each child, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is:

\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = 0.5^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering that each specific sequence is equally likely. Therefore, the total number of families surveyed (N) can be estimated as:

\[ N \approx 45 \times 64 \]

Now, we want to find the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. Since each specific sequence is equally likely, the estimated number of families with this sequence is:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{N}{64} \]

Substituting the estimated total number of families:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
