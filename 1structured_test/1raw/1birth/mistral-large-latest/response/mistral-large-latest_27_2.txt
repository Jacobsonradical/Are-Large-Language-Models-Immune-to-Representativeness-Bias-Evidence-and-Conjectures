To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of this specific sequence occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is large enough that the probability of any specific sequence occurring is uniformly distributed.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is also expected to be the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G, since both sequences have the same probability of occurring.

Thus, the estimate is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]
