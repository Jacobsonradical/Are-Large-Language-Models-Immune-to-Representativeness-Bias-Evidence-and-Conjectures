To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each specific sequence of six children is equally likely. Since there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six children (each child can be either a boy or a girl), and each sequence is equally likely, the probability of any specific sequence occurring is \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering that these 45 families represent \(\frac{1}{64}\) of the total number of families.

Let \(N\) be the total number of families surveyed. Then:
\[
\frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Solving for \(N\):
\[
N = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

Now, we want to find the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. Since each sequence is equally likely, the number of families with this sequence is also \(\frac{1}{64}\) of the total number of families.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:
\[
\frac{2880}{64} = 45
\]

So, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]
