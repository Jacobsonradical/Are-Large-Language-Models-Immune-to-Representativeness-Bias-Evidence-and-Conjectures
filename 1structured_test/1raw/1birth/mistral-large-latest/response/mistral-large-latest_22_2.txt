To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the specific sequence G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Since the probability of any specific sequence is \(\frac{1}{64}\), the expected number of families with any specific sequence (including B G B B B B) should be the same.

Thus, the estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.
