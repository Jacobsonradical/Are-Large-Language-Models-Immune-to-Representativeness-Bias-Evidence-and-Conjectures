To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G), there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of births for six children.

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the probability of any specific sequence occurring is approximately the same for all sequences. Therefore, the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should also be around 45, assuming a uniform distribution of birth sequences.

Thus, the estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
