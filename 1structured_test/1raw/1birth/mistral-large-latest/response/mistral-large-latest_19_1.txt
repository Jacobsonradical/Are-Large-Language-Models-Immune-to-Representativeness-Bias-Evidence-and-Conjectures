To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the information given about the birth order G B G B B G.

First, let's consider the probability of each specific birth order occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is:

\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. The expected number of families with any specific sequence (like G B G B B G) is:

\[ \frac{N}{64} \]

Since we know that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{N}{64} = 45 \]

Solving for \( N \):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, we want to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. Since each specific sequence of six children is equally likely, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is also:

\[ \frac{N}{64} \]

Using the total number of families \( N = 2880 \):

\[ \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
