To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each specific sequence of six children is equally likely. Since the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed and then find the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B.

There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six children, as each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G). If the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (\(N\)) as follows:

\[
\frac{45}{64} = \frac{N}{1}
\]

Solving for \(N\):

\[
N = 45 \times 64
\]

Now, we want to find the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. Since each sequence is equally likely, the expected number of families with this specific sequence is:

\[
\frac{N}{64} = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
