To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of a specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the number of families with any specific sequence should be similar, as the probability of each sequence occurring is the same.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is also 45.

{answer: 45}
