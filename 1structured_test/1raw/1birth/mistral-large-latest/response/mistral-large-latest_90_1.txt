To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the information given about the birth order G B G B B G.

The probability of any specific sequence of six children (where each child is either a boy or a girl) is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 \) because each child has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl.

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering the probability of this specific sequence occurring.

The probability of the sequence G B G B B G is:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. The expected number of families with the sequence G B G B B G is:
\[ N \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Solving for \( N \):
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Now, we want to estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. The probability of this sequence is also \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

The expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:
\[ 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]
