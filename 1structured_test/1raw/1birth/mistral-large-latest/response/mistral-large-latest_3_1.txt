To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each specific sequence of six children is equally likely. Since there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six children (each child can be either a boy or a girl), each specific sequence has a probability of \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by multiplying 45 by 64:

\[ \text{Total number of families} = 45 \times 64 \]

Now, to find the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same probability of \(\frac{1}{64}\):

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{\text{Total number of families}}{64} \]

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
