To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of a specific sequence occurring. Since the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is assumed to be 0.5 for each birth, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \((0.5)^6\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering that each specific sequence is equally likely.

The probability of the sequence G B G B B G is:
\[ P(\text{G B G B B G}) = (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

If 45 families have this sequence, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (\(N\)) as:
\[ 45 = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Now, using the same logic, the probability of the sequence B G B B B B is also \((0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64}\). Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:
\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = 45 \]

Thus, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]
