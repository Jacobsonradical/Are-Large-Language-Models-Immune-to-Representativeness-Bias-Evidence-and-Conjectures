To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the specific order G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is much larger, but we can use the probability to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Since the probability of any specific sequence is the same, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B to be the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G, which is 45.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
