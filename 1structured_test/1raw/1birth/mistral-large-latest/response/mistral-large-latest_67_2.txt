To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probability and the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., 0.5 for each).

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can calculate the probability of this specific order occurring:

\[ P(\text{G B G B B G}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Since there are 45 families with this order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by multiplying the inverse of this probability by the number of families with the order G B G B B G:

\[ \text{Total families surveyed} = 45 \times 64 \]

Now, we want to find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. The probability of this specific order occurring is also:

\[ P(\text{B G B B B B}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Using the estimated total number of families surveyed, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{\text{Total families surveyed}}{64} \]

Substituting the estimated total number of families surveyed:

\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
