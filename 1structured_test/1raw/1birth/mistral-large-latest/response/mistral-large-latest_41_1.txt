To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the given information about the birth order G B G B B G. Since the probability of having a boy or a girl is assumed to be equal (1/2 for each), the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \((1/2)^6\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this number to estimate the total number of families surveyed. The probability of the specific sequence G B G B B G occurring is also \((1/2)^6\).

Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. The expected number of families with the sequence G B G B B G is:
\[ N \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = 45 \]

Solving for \( N \):
\[ N \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Now, we estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. Since the probability of this sequence is also \((1/2)^6\), the expected number of families with this sequence is:
\[ 2880 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]
