To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can treat the sequence of births as a series of independent Bernoulli trials, where each child has a probability \( p \) of being a boy and \( 1-p \) of being a girl. Assuming \( p = 0.5 \) for simplicity, the probability of any specific sequence of six children occurring is \( (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. The expected number of families with a specific sequence is \( N \times \frac{1}{64} \).

For the sequence G B G B B G, we have:
\[ 45 = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \( N \):
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B using the same probability:
\[ \text{Expected number of families with B G B B B B} = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]
