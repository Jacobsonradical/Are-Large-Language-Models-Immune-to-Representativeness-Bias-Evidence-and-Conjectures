To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of each specific sequence occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is large enough that the probability distribution of birth orders is uniform. Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B by multiplying the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G by the ratio of their probabilities, which is 1 since both sequences are equally likely.

Thus, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.
