To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of each specific birth order occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can assume that the probability of this specific sequence occurring is the same as the probability of any other specific sequence of six children, including B G B B B B.

Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by multiplying the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G by the ratio of the probabilities of these two sequences. Since the probabilities are the same, the ratio is 1.

Thus, the estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[ 45 \times 1 = 45 \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \text{{answer: 45}} \]
