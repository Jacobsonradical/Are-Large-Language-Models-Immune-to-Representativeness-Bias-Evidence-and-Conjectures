To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equally likely, i.e., 0.5 for each.

Given that the order G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. The probability of a specific sequence of six children (e.g., G B G B B G) occurring is:

\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

If 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (\(N\)) by:

\[ 45 = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \(N\):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, we want to find the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. The probability of this sequence is also:

\[ P(\text{B G B B B B}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:

\[ \text{Estimated number} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

So, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
