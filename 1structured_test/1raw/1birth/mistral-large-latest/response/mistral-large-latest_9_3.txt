To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of each specific sequence occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the chance of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the probability of any specific sequence occurring is the same for all sequences. Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B by multiplying the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G by the ratio of the probabilities of the two sequences.

Since the probability of each sequence is the same, the ratio is 1. Thus, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is also 45.

\[
\text{Estimate} = 45
\]

So, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
