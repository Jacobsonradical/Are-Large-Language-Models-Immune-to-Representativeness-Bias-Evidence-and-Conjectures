To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the specific order G B G B B G, we can assume that the probability of this sequence occurring is the same as the probability of any other specific sequence, including B G B B B B.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, which is 45.

So, the estimate is:
