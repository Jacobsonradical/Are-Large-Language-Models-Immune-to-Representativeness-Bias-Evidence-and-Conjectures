To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of a specific sequence of births. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\).

Given that there are 45 families with the exact order G B G B B G, we can assume that the number of families with any specific sequence should be similar, as each sequence is equally likely.

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.

{answer: 45}
