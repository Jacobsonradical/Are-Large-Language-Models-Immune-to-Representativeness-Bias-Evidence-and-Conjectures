To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of each specific sequence occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \((\frac{1}{2})^6 = \frac{1}{64}\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is large enough that each specific sequence is equally likely to occur. Therefore, the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should be approximately the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G, which is 45.

Thus, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
