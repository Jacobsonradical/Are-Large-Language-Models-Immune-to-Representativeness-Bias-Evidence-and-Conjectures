To provide an estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equally likely for each birth. Therefore, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Since each specific sequence of six children has the same probability, the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should be approximately the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G.

Thus, the estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
