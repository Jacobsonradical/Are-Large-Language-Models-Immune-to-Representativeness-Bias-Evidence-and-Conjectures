To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy or a girl, there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of births for six children.

Given that the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can assume that each specific sequence is equally likely. Therefore, the probability of any specific sequence occurring is:

\[
\frac{45}{64}
\]

To find the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same probability:

\[
\text{Estimated number of families} = \frac{45}{64} \times 64 = 45
\]

Thus, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
