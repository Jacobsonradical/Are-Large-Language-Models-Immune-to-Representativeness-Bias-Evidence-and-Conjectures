To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each specific sequence of six children is equally likely. Since the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed and then find the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B.

There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six children (since each child can be either a boy or a girl). If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

\[ \text{Total number of families} = \frac{64 \times 45}{1} = 2880 \]

Now, since each sequence is equally likely, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:

\[ \text{Expected number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
