To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (1/2 for each). Since the order G B G B B G has a probability of (1/2)^6, and there are 45 families with this order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (N) as follows:

45 = N * (1/2)^6

Now, we want to find the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, which also has a probability of (1/2)^6. Let's call this number X:

X = N * (1/2)^6

Since both orders have the same probability, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.

{answer: 45}
