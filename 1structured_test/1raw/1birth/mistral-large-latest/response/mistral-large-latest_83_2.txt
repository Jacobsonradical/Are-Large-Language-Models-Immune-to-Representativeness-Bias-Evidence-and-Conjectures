To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of a specific sequence occurring. Since each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the probability of this sequence occurring is the same as the probability of any other specific sequence occurring, including B G B B B B.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would also be 45, assuming the same probability distribution.

\[
\text{Estimate} = 45
\]

So, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
