To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the specific birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Since the probability of any specific sequence is \( \frac{1}{64} \), the expected number of families with any specific sequence (including B G B B B B) should be the same if the total number of families is large enough.

Therefore, if 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately the same number of families will have the sequence B G B B B B.

\[
\text{Estimate of families with B G B B B B} = 45
\]

So, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
