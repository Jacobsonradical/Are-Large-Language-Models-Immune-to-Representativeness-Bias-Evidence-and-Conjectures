To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probability and the given data.

The probability of any specific sequence of six children (e.g., G B G B B G) occurring is the same as the probability of any other specific sequence (e.g., B G B B B B), assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., 0.5 for each).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B by assuming that the probability of each sequence is the same.

Since there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six children (each child can be either a boy or a girl), and we are given the count for one specific sequence, we can estimate the count for another specific sequence as follows:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with sequence B G B B B B} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
