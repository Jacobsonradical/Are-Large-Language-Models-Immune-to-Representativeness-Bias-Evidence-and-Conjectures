To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the information given for the birth order G B G B B G. The probability of any specific sequence of births occurring is the same for any sequence of six children, assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., 0.5 for each).

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by assuming that the distribution of specific birth orders is uniform across all possible sequences.

The total number of possible sequences of six children (each being either a boy or a girl) is \(2^6 = 64\).

Since each specific sequence is equally likely, the expected number of families with any specific sequence (such as B G B B B B) should be the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G, which is 45.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
