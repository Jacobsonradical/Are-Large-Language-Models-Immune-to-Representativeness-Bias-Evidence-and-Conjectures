To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the specific order G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is large enough that the probability of any specific sequence occurring is uniformly distributed.

Therefore, the expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, because both sequences are equally likely.

Thus, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
