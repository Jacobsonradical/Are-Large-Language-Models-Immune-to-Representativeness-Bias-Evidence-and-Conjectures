To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equal, i.e., 0.5 for each. The probability of any specific sequence of six children is therefore \(0.5^6\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Since the probability of any specific sequence occurring is \(0.5^6\), the expected number of families with any specific sequence should be the same if the total number of families is large enough.

Let \(N\) be the total number of families surveyed. The expected number of families with the sequence G B G B B G is:
\[ N \times 0.5^6 = 45 \]

Solving for \(N\):
\[ N \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Now, we estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. Since the probability of this sequence is also \(0.5^6\), the expected number of families with this sequence is:
\[ 2880 \times 0.5^6 = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]
