To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equally likely, i.e., 0.5 for each.

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families with six children. Since each specific sequence of six children (e.g., G B G B B G) has an equal probability of occurring, we can calculate the probability of any specific sequence occurring.

The probability of any specific sequence of six children (e.g., B G B B B B) is:
\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Since there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families with six children by considering that the sequence G B G B B G is just one of the 64 possible sequences. Therefore, the estimated total number of families with six children is:
\[ \text{Total families} = 45 \times 64 \]

Now, to find the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same probability of \(\frac{1}{64}\) for this sequence. Thus, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:
\[ \text{Estimated families with B G B B B B} = \frac{\text{Total families}}{64} = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]
