To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., 1/2 for each). Since the sequence G B G B B G has the same number of boys and girls as the sequence B G B B B B, we can expect the probabilities of these sequences to be the same under the assumption of random birth order.

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate that there will be approximately the same number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Therefore, the estimate is:
{answer: 45}
