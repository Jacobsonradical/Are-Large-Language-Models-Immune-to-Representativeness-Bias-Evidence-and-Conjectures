To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \((\frac{1}{2})^6 = \frac{1}{64}\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering that each specific sequence is equally likely. Therefore, the total number of families surveyed can be estimated as:

\[ \text{Total families surveyed} = 45 \times 64 \]

Now, we want to find the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. Since each sequence is equally likely, the expected number of families with this sequence is the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = 45 \]

Thus, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
