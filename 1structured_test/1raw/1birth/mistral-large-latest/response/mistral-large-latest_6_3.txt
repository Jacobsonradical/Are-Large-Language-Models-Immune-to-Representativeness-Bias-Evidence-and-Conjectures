To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the information given about the birth order G B G B B G. Since both sequences are specific orders of births, we can assume that the probability of any specific sequence of six children is the same as any other specific sequence, given a large enough sample size.

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to be the same, assuming the distribution of birth orders is uniform.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
