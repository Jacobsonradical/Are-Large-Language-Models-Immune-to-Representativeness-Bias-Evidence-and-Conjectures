To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can infer that the total number of families surveyed is likely much larger, as this specific sequence is just one of many possible sequences.

Since the probability of any specific sequence is \( \frac{1}{64} \), and we know that 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by multiplying 45 by 64:

\[ \text{Total number of families surveyed} \approx 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, to find the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same probability \( \frac{1}{64} \):

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
