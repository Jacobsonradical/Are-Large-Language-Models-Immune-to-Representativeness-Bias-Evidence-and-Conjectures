To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equally likely, i.e., 0.5 for each.

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

The probability of any specific sequence of six births (e.g., G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is:
\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Since the probability of each specific sequence is the same, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by assuming it is the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[ \text{Estimate} = 45 \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \{\text{answer: 45}\} \]
