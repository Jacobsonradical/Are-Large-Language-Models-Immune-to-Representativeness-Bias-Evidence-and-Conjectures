To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each specific sequence of six children is equally likely. Since there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six children (each child can be either a boy or a girl), each specific sequence has a probability of \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. If the sequence G B G B B G occurs with a probability of \(\frac{1}{64}\), then the total number of families surveyed, \(N\), can be estimated as:

\[
N \approx 45 \times 64
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
N \approx 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

Now, since each specific sequence (including B G B B B B) also has a probability of \(\frac{1}{64}\), the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:

\[
\text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
