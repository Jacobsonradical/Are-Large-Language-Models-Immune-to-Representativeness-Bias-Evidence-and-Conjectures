To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the information given about the birth order G B G B B G.

First, we need to understand the probability of each specific birth order occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\).

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. The expected number of families with any specific birth order is \( N \times (1/64) \).

Since we know that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 45 = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \( N \):
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Now, we want to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. Since each specific birth order has the same probability of occurring, the expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also \( N \times (1/64) \).

Using the total number of families \( N = 2880 \):
\[ \text{Expected number of families with B G B B B B} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ \text{Expected number of families with B G B B B B} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]
