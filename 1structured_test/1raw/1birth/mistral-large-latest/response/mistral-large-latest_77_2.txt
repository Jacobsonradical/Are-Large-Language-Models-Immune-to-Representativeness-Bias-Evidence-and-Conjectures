To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the specific sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering that each specific sequence is equally likely. Therefore, the total number of families surveyed can be estimated as:

\[ \text{Total families} = 45 \times 64 \]

Now, we want to find the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. Since each specific sequence is equally likely, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G, which is 45.

Thus, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
