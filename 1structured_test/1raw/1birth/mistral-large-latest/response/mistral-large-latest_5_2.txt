To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the concept of equally likely outcomes. Since each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is the same.

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the probability of this sequence occurring is the same as the probability of the sequence B G B B B B occurring.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.

{answer: 45}
