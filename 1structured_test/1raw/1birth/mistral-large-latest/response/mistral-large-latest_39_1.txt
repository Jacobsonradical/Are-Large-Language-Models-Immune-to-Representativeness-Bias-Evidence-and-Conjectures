To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the information given about the birth order G B G B B G. Since both sequences are specific orders of births, we can assume that the probability of any specific sequence of six children occurring is the same for any other specific sequence.

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by assuming that the distribution of specific birth orders is uniform.

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.

{answer: 45}
