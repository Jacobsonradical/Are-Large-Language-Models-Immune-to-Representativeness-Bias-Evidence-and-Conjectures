To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of each specific sequence occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the chance of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the probability of any specific sequence occurring is the same. Therefore, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by multiplying the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G by 64 (since each specific sequence has a probability of 1/64).

\[ \text{Total number of families surveyed} = 45 \times 64 \]

Now, to find the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same probability of 1/64.

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{\text{Total number of families surveyed}}{64} \]

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
