To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equally likely for each birth. Therefore, each specific sequence of six children (such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is equally probable.

Given that there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of birth orders for six children (since each child can be either a boy or a girl), and we know that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B by assuming that the distribution of sequences is uniform.

Thus, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G, which is 45.
