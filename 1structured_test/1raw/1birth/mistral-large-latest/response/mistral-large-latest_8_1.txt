To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of a specific sequence of births. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the specific order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. The probability of the sequence G B G B B G is also \( \frac{1}{64} \).

Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. The expected number of families with the sequence G B G B B G is \( N \times \frac{1}{64} \). We know this number is 45:

\[ N \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Solving for \( N \):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Now, we want to estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. The probability of this sequence is also \( \frac{1}{64} \). Therefore, the expected number of families with this sequence is:

\[ 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

So, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 45.

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
