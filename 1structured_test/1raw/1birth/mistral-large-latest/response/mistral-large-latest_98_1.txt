To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of each specific sequence occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can infer that the total number of families surveyed is likely to be much larger, as each specific sequence is equally probable.

To estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same probability:

\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = 45 \times \frac{\text{Probability of B G B B B B}}{\text{Probability of G B G B B G}} \]

Since the probabilities are equal:

\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
