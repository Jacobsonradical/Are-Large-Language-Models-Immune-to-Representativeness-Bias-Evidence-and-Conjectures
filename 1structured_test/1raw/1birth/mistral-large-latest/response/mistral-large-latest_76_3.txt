To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of each specific sequence occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the probability of this sequence occurring is the same as the probability of any other specific sequence, including B G B B B B.

Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B by multiplying the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G by the ratio of the probabilities of the two sequences. Since the probabilities are the same, the ratio is 1.

Thus, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is also 45.
