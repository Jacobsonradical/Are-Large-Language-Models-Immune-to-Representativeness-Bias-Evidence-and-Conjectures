To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the information given about the birth order G B G B B G. The probability of any specific sequence of births occurring is the same for each sequence, assuming each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl.

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

The total number of possible birth orders for six children is \(2^6 = 64\), since each child can be either a boy or a girl.

Since the probability of any specific sequence occurring is the same, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to be the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
