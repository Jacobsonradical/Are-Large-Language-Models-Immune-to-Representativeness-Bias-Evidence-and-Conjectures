To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can consider the probability of this specific sequence occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Since the probability of any specific sequence is the same, we can assume that the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be approximately the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
