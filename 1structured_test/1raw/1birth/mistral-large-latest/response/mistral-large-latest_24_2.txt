To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the specific order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering that each specific sequence is equally likely. Therefore, the total number of families surveyed can be estimated as:

\[ \text{Total families surveyed} = 45 \times 64 \]

Now, we want to find the number of families with the specific order B G B B B B. Since each specific sequence is equally likely, the number of families with this order is also:

\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{\text{Total families surveyed}}{64} \]

Substituting the estimated total number of families surveyed:

\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
