To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of each specific birth order occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is large enough that the probability of any specific sequence occurring is uniformly distributed.

Therefore, the expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, because each specific sequence is equally likely.

Thus, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]
