To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probability and the assumption that the birth of a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equally likely.

Given that the birth order G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can calculate the probability of this specific sequence occurring. Since each birth is independent and the probability of having a boy or a girl is 0.5, the probability of the sequence G B G B B G is:

\[ P(\text{G B G B B G}) = 0.5^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

The number of families with this sequence is 45, so we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (\( N \)) by:

\[ N \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Now, we need to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. The probability of this sequence is also:

\[ P(\text{B G B B B B}) = 0.5^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Using the total number of families surveyed (\( N = 2880 \)), the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
