To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G), and assuming the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., 0.5 for each), the probability of any specific sequence of six children is:

\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering that each specific sequence is equally likely. Therefore, the total number of families surveyed (N) can be estimated as:

\[ N \approx 45 \times 64 \]

Now, to find the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same probability:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = N \times P(\text{B G B B B B}) \]

Since \( P(\text{B G B B B B}) = \frac{1}{64} \), we have:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = 45 \times 64 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
