To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the probability of any specific sequence of births occurring. Since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G), and assuming the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (1/2), the probability of any specific sequence of six children is:

\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. The probability of observing any specific sequence (like G B G B B G) is also \(\frac{1}{64}\). Therefore, the expected number of families with any specific sequence (including B G B B B B) should be the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G, which is 45.

Thus, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]
