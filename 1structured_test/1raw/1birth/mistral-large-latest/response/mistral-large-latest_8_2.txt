To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each specific sequence of six children is equally likely. Since there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six children (each child can be either a boy or a girl), each specific sequence has a probability of \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B by assuming the same probability for each sequence.

Thus, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is also 45.
