To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the fact that each specific sequence of six children (such as G B G B B G) is equally likely, assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is 0.5 for each birth.

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering the number of possible sequences of six children. There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six children (since each child can be either a boy or a girl).

Since each sequence is equally likely, the expected number of families with any specific sequence (such as B G B B B B) is the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.
