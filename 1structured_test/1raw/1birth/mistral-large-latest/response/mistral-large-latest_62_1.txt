To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equally likely for each birth, i.e., \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed.

First, calculate the probability of the specific sequence G B G B B G:
\[
P(\text{G B G B B G}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Since there are 45 families with this sequence, the estimated total number of families surveyed (\(N\)) can be found by:
\[
45 = N \times \frac{1}{64}
\]
\[
N = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

Next, calculate the probability of the specific sequence B G B B B B:
\[
P(\text{B G B B B B}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Using the estimated total number of families surveyed (\(N = 2880\)), the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[
\text{Estimated number of families} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]
