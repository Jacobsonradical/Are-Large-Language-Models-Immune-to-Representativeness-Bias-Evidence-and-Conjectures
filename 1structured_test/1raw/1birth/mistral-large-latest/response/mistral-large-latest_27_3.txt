To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equally likely, i.e., 1/2 for each child.

The probability of a specific sequence of births (e.g., G B G B B G or B G B B B B) occurring is:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering that each specific sequence is equally likely. Therefore, the total number of families surveyed (N) can be estimated as:
\[ N \approx 45 \times 64 \]

Now, to find the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same probability calculation:
\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = N \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 \]
\[ = 45 \times 64 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 45 \]

Thus, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]
