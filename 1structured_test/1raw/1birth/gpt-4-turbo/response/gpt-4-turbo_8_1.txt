To estimate the number of families surveyed where the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the data provided for the sequence G B G B B G, assuming each child is equally likely to be a boy (B) or a girl (G). 

The probability of any specific sequence of 6 births where the probability of either a boy or girl is 1/2 can be calculated as:
\[ P = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

The number of observed families where the exact order was G B G B B G can provide a basis for estimating how many families would have the sequence B G B B B B, under the assumption that all sequences are equally likely.

Since the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G was 45, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by finding out how many times 1/64 of the families would total to 45:
\[ 45 = \text{Total families} \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ \text{Total families} = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, using the same probability for the sequence B G B B B B, which is also \( \frac{1}{64} \) because it contains exactly the same number of girls and boys as the previously mentioned sequence, we would expect:
\[ 45 = \text{Total families} \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ \text{Families with B G B B B B} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Thus, approximately 45 families would have the birth order B G B B B B.
