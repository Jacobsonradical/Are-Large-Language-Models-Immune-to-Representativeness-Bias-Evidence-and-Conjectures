To estimate the number of families with the pattern BGBBBB based on the information given, we start by assuming that each birth is an independent event where the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (1/2 for a boy and 1/2 for a girl). Therefore, the sequence G B G B B G and the sequence B G B B B B should be equally probable.

The probability of any specific sequence of 6 children (e.g., GBGBBG or BGBBBB) occurring is calculated as:

\[ P = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, and each sequence has the same probability of occurring, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering how many would lead to one occurrence of GBGBBG.

The estimation is based on the following equation for expected occurrences of a sequence:
\[ E = P \times N \]
Where E is the expected number of families with the sequence, P is the probability of the sequence, and N is the total number of families. If there are 45 families with GBGBBG, we solve for N:
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{64} \times N \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Since BGBBBB is equally as likely as GBGBBG:
\[ E(BGBBBB) = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Thus, we estimate that there are also 45 families in which the sequence of births was BGBBBB.
