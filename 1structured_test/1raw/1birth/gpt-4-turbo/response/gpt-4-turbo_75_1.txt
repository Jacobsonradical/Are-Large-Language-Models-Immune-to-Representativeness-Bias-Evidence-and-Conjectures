To solve this problem, we assume that the probability of each child being a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for a boy and 0.5 for a girl). The probability of any specific sequence of six children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) thus depends on the number of boys and girls in that order but does not depend on the specific sequence if the number of boys and girls are the same.

1. For the sequence G B G B B G, there are three boys and three girls. The probability of this exact order occurring (or any specific order of three boys and three girls) is (1/2)^6, since each child is independently a boy or a girl. However, the number of different ways to arrange three boys and three girls in six births is calculated by the combination formula: 6 choose 3 (denoted as C(6,3)). This calculates to:

\[ C(6,3) = \frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \frac{720}{6 \times 6} = 20 \]

The probability of having exactly three boys and three girls in any order in six births is \( 20 \times (\frac{1}{2})^6 = 20 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{20}{64} = \frac{5}{16} \).

2. The sequence B G B B B B contains five boys and one girl. By similar logic:
   - The number of different ways to arrange five boys and one girl in six births is C(6,5) which is also C(6,1), the same as saying "choosing one position for the girl among six births":
   
\[ C(6,1) = \frac{6!}{1!(6-1)!} = \frac{720}{1 \times 120} = 6 \]

The probability of exactly five boys and one girl in any order in six births is \( 6 \times (\frac{1}{2})^6 = 6 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{6}{64} = \frac{3}{32} \).

3. To find the expected number of families with the B G B B B B pattern, we use the proportional ratio between the probabilities of the two patterns and the given data (45 families had G B G B B G):
   
\[ \text{Expected families} = 45 \times \frac{\frac{3}{32}}{\frac{5}{16}} = 45 \times \frac{3 \times 16}{5 \times 32} = 45 \times \frac{48}{160} = 45 \times \frac{3}{10} = 13.5 \].
   
Since the number of families must be an integer, we round to the nearest whole number: 14.
