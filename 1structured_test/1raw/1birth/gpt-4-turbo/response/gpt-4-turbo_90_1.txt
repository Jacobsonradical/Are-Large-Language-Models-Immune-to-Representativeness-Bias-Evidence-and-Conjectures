To estimate the number of families where the birth order was B G B B B B, we can use the assumption of equally likely birth orders given the same number of boys and girls in each family.

From the problem, we know the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families. This sequence contains three boys and three girls. There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) different ways to arrange three boys and three girls.

The desired sequence B G B B B B also contains four boys and two girls. There are \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \) different ways to arrange four boys and two girls.

If we assume the probability distribution of different gender sequences among families is uniform (each unique sequence of any specific number of boys and girls is equally likely), the proportion of families with the sequence B G B B B B would relate to the proportion of sequences of four boys and two girls compared to sequences of three boys and three girls.

Given the 45 families where the order was G B G B B G, and there are 20 equivalent possibilities for any arrangement of three boys and three girls, we calculate the expected number of families for B G B B B B as follows:
- Total families with exactly three boys and three girls = \( 45 \times 20 \)
- Ratio of total families with four boys and two girls to three boys and three girls would be \( \frac{15}{20} = 0.75 \).
- Estimated number of families with four boys and two girls would then be \( 45 \times 20 \times 0.75 \).

Thus, the estimated number of families where the birth order was B G B B B B is:
\( 45 \times 0.75 = 33.75 \).

Since the number of families cannot be a fraction, we round it to the nearest whole number, which is 34.
