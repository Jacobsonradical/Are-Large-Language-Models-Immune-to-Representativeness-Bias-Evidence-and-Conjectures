To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can first calculate the probability of any particular order of genders in a six-child family, like the one reported (G B G B B G).

Assuming that the probability of a child being a boy or a girl is equal (1/2), the probability P of any specific sequence of births (such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B) with exactly three boys and three girls is given by the formula for calculating the probability of a specific sequence in a binomial distribution:
\[ P = \binom{n}{k} \times p^k \times (1-p)^{n-k} \]
where:
- \( n \) is the total number of trials (children), so \( n = 6 \),
- \( k \) represents the number of successful outcomes (either number of boys or girls), for our probabilities \( k = 3 \),
- \( p \) is the probability of achieving a success in one trial (having a boy, or a girl, so \( p = 1/2 \)).

Thus,
\[ P = \binom{6}{3} \times (1/2)^3 \times (1/2)^{3} = 20 \times (1/2)^6 = 20 \times 1/64 = 20/64 = 5/16. \]

So, based on the survey data you provided, we know that in 45 families, the sequence G B G B B G was reported, which aligns with the expected probability of 5/16 for any specific three boy, three girl sequence.

We can estimate the total number of surveyed families by calculating:
\[ \text{Total families} = \frac{\text{Number of families with 'G B G B B G'}}{\text{Probability of 'G B G B B G'}} = \frac{45}{(5/16)} = \frac{45 \times 16}{5} = 144. \]

Now, to find the number of families in which the birth order was B G B B B B, we again use the probability 5/16 (from the same reasoning as before).

Number of families expected with the sequence B G B B B B would be:
\[ 144 \times \frac{5}{16} = \frac{720}{16} = 45. \]

Thus, the estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B would also be approximately:
