To estimate the number of families in which the order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider that each birth is an independent event and the probability of a boy or a girl being born is typically equal (50% chance for each). The order of birth outcomes is described by a binomial distribution in this context, given that each sequence of six children falls into the category of sequences with six trials (births) where each trial has two outcomes (boy or girl).

The sequence G B G B B G contains three girls and three boys. The number of families with this sequence is given as 45. We assume that every unique sequence of three boys and three girls has the same probability of occurring. There are \(\binom{6}{3}\) ways to arrange three boys and three girls, which equals 20 ways.

Now, consider the sequence B G B B B B, which consists of one girl and five boys. The number of ways to arrange one girl among five boys (i.e., choosing 1 position out of 6 for the girl) is \(\binom{6}{1} = 6\) ways.

By assuming that the likelihood of each specific sequence of six children occurring is the same provided the number of boys and girls is fixed, we can say that sequences with less frequent combinations (like one girl and five boys) are less likely than more balanced combinations (like three boys and three girls).

Given the model:
- The ratio of the occurrences of any specific sequence involving three boys and three girls is proportional to the total possible arrangements of three boys and three girls (20 ways).
- Hence, each specific sequence having exactly one arrangement out of 20 shares of 45 families gives: \( \frac{45}{20} = 2.25 \) families per arrangement.

Thus, for the sequence with one girl and five boys, which can occur in 6 ways, we can estimate by:
- \( 2.25 \) families per arrangement in similarly frequent combinations times 6 ways gives us:
\[ 2.25 \times 6 = 13.5 \]

We round 13.5 to the nearest whole number as the number of families surveyed, ensuring our mathematical approach fits real-world data (as it's generally not possible to have a fraction of a family in a survey).
