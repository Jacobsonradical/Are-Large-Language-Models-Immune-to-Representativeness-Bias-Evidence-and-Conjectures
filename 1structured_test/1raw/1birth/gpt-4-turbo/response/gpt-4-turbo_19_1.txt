To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we make use of the assumption of equal probability for boy and girl at each birth, which is reasonable assuming each birth is independent and the likelihood of having a boy or girl is equal (p = 0.5 for each).

First, we calculate the probability of any specific sequence of 6 children sexes (e.g., GBBGBG or BGBBBB). Since each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability (0.5), the probability of any specific sequence of 6 children is:

\[ P(sequence) = (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

In the question, we know that in 45 families, the specific order GBBGBG occurred. The expected number of families having any specific sequence can be assumed to be similar across all possible specific sequences of 6 births, given the assumptions:

\[ \text{Number of families with sequence GBBGBG} = 45 \]

We expect the number of families having the sequence BGBBBB to be similar because each sequence is equally likely under the hypothesis of independent births with equal probabilities for boys and girls.

Given that, our estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is also 45.

{answer: 45}
