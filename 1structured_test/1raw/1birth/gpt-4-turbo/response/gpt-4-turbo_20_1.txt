To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of each gender sequence happening assuming that each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, which is a typical assumption unless specified otherwise.

The probability of any specific sequence of genders among six children (where each child is independently a boy or a girl with probability 0.5) can be calculated using the formula for the probability of k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials, which is given by:

\[ P = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^6 \]

1. First, calculate the probability for any specific sequence (since the probability is the same for any specific sequence like G B G B B G or B G B B B B):
   \[ P = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \left( \frac{1}{64} \right) \]

2. Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, the likelihood of this sequence occurring is the same as that of any other specific sequence of six children (like B G B B B B) because each sequence has the same probability.

3. Since the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we would expect the sequence B G B B B B to occur in approximately the same number of families under the assumption of equal probability for any specific sequence of six children.

Therefore, the estimate is:
{answer: 45}
