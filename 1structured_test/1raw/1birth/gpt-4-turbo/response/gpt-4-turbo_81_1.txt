To estimate the number of families in which the birth order was B G B B B B given the information about the order G B G B B G, we can assume that each possible order of boys and girls among six-child families is equally likely. Each child has an independent \( \frac{1}{2} \) chance of being a boy or a girl. 

For any specific order of six children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B), the probability is:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Given 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we first estimate the total number of families. Since the probability of any specific order occurring by chance is \( \frac{1}{64} \), and we observed 45 such families, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{64} \times \text{Total Number of Families} = 45
\]
\[
\text{Total Number of Families} = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

Now, since any specific sequence (like B G B B B B) has the same probability as any other specific sequence (like G B G B B G), the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B will also be:
\[
\frac{2880}{64} = 45
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed where the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
{answer: 45}
