To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of each birth order occurring under the assumption that each birth is equally likely to result in a boy or a girl.

The probability of any specific sequence of 6 children with 2 girls and 4 boys (such as G B G B B G) is:

\[ P = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

given that the probability of being born a girl or a boy is \( \frac{1}{2} \) and assuming independence of the gender of each child.

The sequence G B G B B G involves having 2 girls and 4 boys. Any specific order of births consisting of exactly 2 girls and 4 boys will have the same probability of \( \frac{1}{64} \). 

We found 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G. We assume that other certain sequences (like B G B B B B) would similarly occur with a probability of \( \frac{1}{64} \).

All such sequences can be determined by the different ways to choose the positions for the 2 girls among the 6 children, which is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{6}{2}\):

\[ \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]

Each such sequence should ideally appear in \( \frac{1}{64} \) of families. Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we estimate the total number of families surveyed as:

\[ Total \approx \frac{45}{1/64} = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

The estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is then also \( \frac{1}{64} \) of the total, since it's just another specific sequence out of the 15 possible ones:

\[ Number \approx \frac{2880}{15} = 192 \]

Thus, our estimate for the number of families where the birth order was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 192}
