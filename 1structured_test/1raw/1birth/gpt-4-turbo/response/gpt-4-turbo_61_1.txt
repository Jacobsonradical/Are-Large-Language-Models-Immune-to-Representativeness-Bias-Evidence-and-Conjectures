To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the binomial probability formula, assuming the probability of a child being a boy or a girl is equal (1/2 for each), given no information suggesting otherwise.

Let's denote \( P(k) \) as the probability of having exactly \( k \) boys.

Given:
- The order G B G B B G consists of 3 boys and 3 girls.
- The order B G B B B B consists of 5 boys and 1 girl.

The formula for the binomial probability of \( k \) successes in \( n \) trials (births) with probability \( p \) of success (having a boy) in each trial is:

\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

Plugging in \( n = 6 \), \( p = 0.5 \), and \( k = 5 \) for the order B G B B B B:
\[
P(5) = \binom{6}{5} (0.5)^5 (0.5)^{1} = 6 \times 0.5^6 = 6 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{6}{64} = \frac{3}{32}
\]

The sample probability of 3 boys and 3 girls for G B G B B G is given by:
\[
P(3) = \binom{6}{3} (0.5)^3 (0.5)^3 = 20 \times 0.5^6 = 20 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{20}{64} = \frac{5}{16}
\]
Since 45 families have the G B G B B G sequence, we estimate the total families surveyed based on the probability \( P(3) \) and the count of these families as:
\[
45 = \frac{5}{16} \times \text{Total Families} \implies \text{Total Families} = \frac{45 \times 16}{5} = 144
\]

Now estimating the families with the B G B B B B sequence:
\[
\text{Expected number of families} = P(5) \times \text{Total Families} = \frac{3}{32} \times 144 = \frac{3 \times 144}{32} = \frac{432}{32} = 13.5
\]

Since the number of families cannot be a fraction, we round to the nearest whole number:
\[
\approx 14
\]
