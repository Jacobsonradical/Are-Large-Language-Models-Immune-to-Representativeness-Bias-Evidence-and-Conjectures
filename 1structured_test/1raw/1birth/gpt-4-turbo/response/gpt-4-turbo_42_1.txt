To solve this problem, we need to understand and apply probability concepts specifically concerning sequences of binary outcomes (boy or girl) in family births.

1. **Assumptions and Basic Probability**: 
   - Assume that the births of boys and girls are equally likely (each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl).
   - The likelihood of having a boy or a girl is independent for each child, with probability \( p(\text{boy}) = 0.5 \) and \( p(\text{girl}) = 0.5 \).

2. **Exact Sequence Probability**: 
   - The probability of any specific sequence of six children births (like G B G B B G) is \( (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \). 

3. **Given Information**:
   - We are told that in 45 families the birth sequence was G B G B B G (a specific arrangement of 3 boys and 3 girls).

4. **Expected Number of Each Sequence**:
   - Since the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families and considering each specific sequence of 6 births is equally likely, the estimated total number of families that can be calculated for any sequence is determined by looking proportionally.

5. **Calculate Number of Total Families Surveyed**:
   - If 1 specific sequence has a chance of \( \frac{1}{64} \) for each family, and it occurred 45 times, we can estimate the total families surveyed, \( N \), such that \( \frac{1}{64} N = 45 \) or \( N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \).

6. **Estimate for Sequence B G B B B B**:
   - Given that each of the 64 possible sequences is equally likely, and we have an estimated 2880 families,
   - The expected number of families having the sequence B G B B B B, which also has exactly six determined positions (like the given example), would be \( \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \).
   
7. **Final Estimation**:
   - The expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is thus also 45.

Hence:
{answer: 45}
