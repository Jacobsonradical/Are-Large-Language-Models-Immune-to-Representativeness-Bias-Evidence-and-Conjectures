To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of binomial probability. We will assume the probability of a child being a girl (G) or a boy (B) is the same and equal to 1/2, and each birth is an independent event.

In the given problem, the sequence G B G B B G was observed in 45 families among families with six children.

For any specific sequence of 6 children:
- The probability of any specific sequence (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) occurring is (1/2)^6, since there are 6 children and each child can independently be a boy or a girl with probability 1/2.

(1/2)^6 = 1/64

This means that any specific sequence has a likelihood of 1/64. If the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can estimate the total number of families surveyd as follows:
- Let N represent the total number of families surveyed. The expected number of families to observe any specific sequence (like G B G B B G) would thus be N/64.
- Since 45 families were observed with the sequence G B G B B G, we set N/64 = 45, solving for N gives N = 45 * 64 = 2880.

Since each sequence is equally likely, and assuming the city's births are not biased towards a particular gender, the sequence B G B B B B, which also has exactly 6 children with any ordering, should occur in the same proportion:
- There would also be approximately 45 families with the sequence B G B B B B.

Thus, the estimate is:
{answer: 45}
