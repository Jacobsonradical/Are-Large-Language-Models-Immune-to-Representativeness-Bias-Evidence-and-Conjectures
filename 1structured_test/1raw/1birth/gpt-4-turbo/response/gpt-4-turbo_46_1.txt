To solve this problem, we should consider that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is assumed to be equal for each child, and either event occurs with a probability of 0.5. Thus, each specific sequence of boy/girl births across six children has the same probability of occurring.

The probability \( P \) of any specific sequence of six births (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) occurring is given by:
\[ P = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \]

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed. The sequence G B G B B G is one of all possible sequences of six births and since the probabilities are equal for all sequences, the number of families for each sequence should be similar if enough families are surveyed.

There are \( 2^6 = 64 \) possible different sequences when considering six births with binary outcomes (boy or girl). If one specific sequence has 45 occurrences, the expected total number of families (assuming uniform distribution across all sequences) can be estimated by:
\[ \text{Total families} = \frac{45}{1/64} = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Assuming that the distribution of the sequences is exactly uniform, it's reasonable to estimate that there should also be around 45 families in which the sequence B G B B B B occurred, because each possible sequence of six births happens with the same probability.

Thus:
{answer: 45}
