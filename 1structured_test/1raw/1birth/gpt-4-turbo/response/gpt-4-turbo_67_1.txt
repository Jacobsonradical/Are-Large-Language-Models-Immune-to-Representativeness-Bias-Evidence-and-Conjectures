To estimate the number of families with six children in which the birth order was B G B B B B, we can first consider the methodology of the situation using basic probability concepts and binomial theory, under the assumption of equally likely genders (boy or girl) at each birth.

Each family has six children, and each child being either a boy or girl has a probability of 1/2, assuming the probabilities are independent and gender distribution is balanced. The probability of any specific arrangement of boys and girls in six children would be:

\[ P(\text{specific arrangement}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

For the arrangement "G B G B B G", there are equally rare events amongst the different possible arrangements of six children. This specific arrangement (G B G B B G) is just one of the possible 64 outcomes (since \(2^6 = 64\)), and each of these arrangements should occur with equal likelihood under the assumption of the independence and equal probability of having a boy or a girl.

If there are 45 families with the pattern "G B G B B G", which is one of the 64 patterns:

Given that:
- Total number of surveyed families = N
- 1 specific pattern observed in 45 families,
- Each of the 64 patterns (including "B G B B B B") are equally likely,

We can set up an equation under the assumptions:
\[ \frac{N}{64} = 45 \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]

\[ N = 2880 \]  (the total number of families)

Now, since every pattern is equally likely (1 out of 64), there should be approximately the same number of families with the pattern "B G B B B B":

\[ \text{Estimated Number of families with "B G B B B B"} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

So, the estimate for the number of families with six children in the exact order B G B B B B is:
