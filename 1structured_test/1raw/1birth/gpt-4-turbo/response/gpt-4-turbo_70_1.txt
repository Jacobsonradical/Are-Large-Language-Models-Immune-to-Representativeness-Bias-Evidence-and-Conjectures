To estimate the number of families where the order of births was B G B B B B, we'll use some basic principles of probability, assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (1/2), and each child's gender is independent of their siblings'.

1. First, find the probability of the sequence G B G B B G.

   Probability(P) = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

2. The number of families with this pattern is given as 45. Assuming each six-child sequence is equally likely, the total number of families surveyed (N) can be calculated by assuming the probability of any specific sequence happening is 1/64:
   
   N * 1/64 = 45
   N = 45 * 64 = 2880 families

3. Now estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B. Since each birth event is independent, the probability of this sequence is the same as any other specific sequence:
   
   Probability(P') = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

4. Multiplying this probability by the total number of families gives the estimated number:

   Estimated number = N * P' = 2880 * 1/64 = 45 families

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
