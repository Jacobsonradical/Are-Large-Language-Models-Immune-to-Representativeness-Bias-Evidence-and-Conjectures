To estimate the number of families where the sequence of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the likelihood of each birth sequence under the assumption that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) at each birth is independent and equally likely (i.e., the probability for each is 0.5). 

Given the sequence G B G B B G from the survey of 45 families, the probability of this particular sequence occurring is:
\[ P(\text{G B G B B G}) = (0.5)^6 \]
because each birth is an independent event and there are six births, with the probability of G or B being 0.5 each. Notice, however, the coefficient 1 because we are considering one specific sequence.

In a similar manner, the probability of the sequence B G B B B B is:
\[ P(\text{B G B B B B}) = (0.5)^6 \]
since it also has six births, each with a probability of 0.5 of being either G or B.

Because the probabilities of any specific sequence of six children (where order matters and each child can be either a boy or a girl with equal likelihood) are equal, we can deduce that any particular sequence will occur with the same probability. 

Therefore, if there were 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, then there should theoretically also be approximately 45 families with the sequence B G B B B B, assuming a large enough sample and a fair representation of all possible sequences in the surveyed population.

Based on this reasoning, the answer is:
