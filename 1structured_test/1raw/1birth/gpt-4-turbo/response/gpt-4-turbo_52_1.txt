To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the binomial distribution as a tool to understand the probabilities of these specific sequences of genders given a certain probability of being born a boy or a girl. Typically, it's assumed the probability of a child being a boy (B) or a girl (G) is about equal (50% each).

The key is to determine the likelihood of each specific sequence of births occurring and scaling it by the total number of families surveyed.

1. For the sequence G B G B B G:
   - The probability of each G or B happening in that specific order under the assumption of equal likelihood (0.5 for each G or B) is:
     \( (0.5) \times (0.5) \times (0.5) \times (0.5) \times (0.5) \times (0.5) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \)

2. Given this probability, and that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:
   - The number of families, \( N \), follows approximately by estimating from \( 0.015625 \times N = 45 \).
   - So, \( N = \frac{45}{0.015625} = 2880 \).

3. For the sequence B G B B B B:
   - The probability of this sequence is similarly calculated as \( (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \) (since each birth event is independent and the probability of child being a boy or girl is the same).

4. Using the estimate of total families surveyed:
   - Expected families with B G B B B B is \( 2880 \times 0.015625 = 45 \).

Thus, the estimated number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
