Each specific sequence of 6 children consisting of boys (B) and girls (G) has the same probability provided each child is independently a boy or a girl with equal likelihood. Hence, each sequence has a probability of \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

The number of families surveyed having the exact order G B G B B G was 45. Since this sequence is just one of the possible 64 sequences, and assuming all sequences are equally likely due to independence and equal probability of births being a boy or a girl, the ratio of families for each specific sequence would be similar.

Thus, the estimated number of families where the exact order of births is B G B B B B would also be 45, as the likelihood of any specific order of six children (assuming equal probability of boy or girl at each birth) is the same.
