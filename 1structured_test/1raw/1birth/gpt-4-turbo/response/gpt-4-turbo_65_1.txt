To approach this problem, we assume that each child being born a boy (B) or a girl (G) is an independent event, and the probability of either event is 1/2 under the assumption of equal likelihood for boy or girl birth.

The number of specific sequences of births in these surveyed families can be estimated by the binomial probability formula, which in general terms is:

\[
P(k \text{ successes in } n \text{ trials}) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

where \( \binom{n}{k} \) denotes a binomial coefficient, \( p \) is the probability of success (having a boy), \( n \) is the total number of trials (children, here 6), and \( k \) is the number of successes (number of boys).

1. **The pattern G B G B B G**
   Number of boys \( k = 3 \) and number of girls \( 6 - k = 3 \)
   Probability of this sequence occurring (since the positions of boys and girls are fixed):
   \[
   P(\text{G B G B B G}) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64
   \]

2. **The pattern B G B B B B**
   Number of boys \( k = 5 \) and number of girls \( 6 - k = 1 \)
   Probability of this sequence occurring:
   \[
   P(\text{B G B B B B}) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64
   \]

Given that the probability of each sequence occurring is the same, namely, \( 1/64 \), and there are 45 families where the sequence 'G B G B B G' occurred, we estimate that the same number of families would likely be observed with the sequence 'B G B B B B' under uniform distribution conditions.

Thus, since we are using the result for one pattern to estimate the occurrence of another pattern with the same probability, the answer is:

{answer: 45}
