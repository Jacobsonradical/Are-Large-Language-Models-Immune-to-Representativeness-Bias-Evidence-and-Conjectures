The problem involves examining different sequences of gender birth in families of six children, specifically adjusting for different probabilities for sequences based solely on their arrangement.

Given: 
- In 45 families, the sequence of births is G B G B B G.

We need to estimate:
- Number of families with the sequence B G B B B B.

Assuming the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (1/2 for each), each specific sequence of six children (BBBGGB, GGBBGB, etc.) has the same probability of occurrence.

The total probability for any specific sequence is:
- \( P(S) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64 \)

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, it suggests:
- Given 1/64 chance per sequence, the estimated total number of families surveyed (T) can be approximated by assuming the observed 45 families represent 1/64 of the total:

  \( T \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \)
  \( T = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \) families

- Hence, this suggests there were approximately 2880 families surveyed in total. 
- The number of families with any specific sequence (including B G B B B B) should be similar, as the probability of occurrence for any specific 6-child sequence is the same.

Thus, following this reasoning:
- The estimated number of families where the order of birth is B G B B B B should also be approximately 45.
