To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we start by assuming that the probability of a child being born a boy or a girl is equal, thus \( P(B) = P(G) = 0.5 \). 

The probability of any specific sequence of 6 children (e.g., G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each child, given the respective gender. Since each position in the sequence is independent of the others, this is \( (0.5)^6 \). 

The sequence G B G B B G and the sequence B G B B B B both have exactly three boys and three girls. Therefore, the probability for any specific sequence of three boys and three girls is the same (\( (0.5)^6 \)). This means if we know the frequency of occurrence of one such sequence, we can estimate the frequency of occurrence of another sequence with the same number of boys and girls.

In the survey, 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G. We assume the other sequences with three boys and three girls are equally likely. The total number of such sequences can be found by calculating the number of ways to arrange 3 boys and 3 girls, which is given by the combination formula \( \binom{6}{3} \), where \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the number of ways to choose \( k \) items from \( n \) items without regard to order.

\[
\binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3! \times (6-3)!} = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 20
\]

There are 20 different sequences with three boys and three girls. Given that 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, and assuming uniform distribution of all sequences with three boys and three girls, it's reasonable to estimate that the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B will be similar to the number for any given sequence of three boys and three girls.

Therefore, my estimate is:
