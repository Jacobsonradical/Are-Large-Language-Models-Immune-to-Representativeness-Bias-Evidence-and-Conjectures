To solve this problem, we can use the concept of probability, specifically focusing on binomial probability distributions as each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal likelihood (assuming the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal and independent of other births).

Given:
- A binary outcome (B or G).
- Probability of a boy (P(B)) = 1/2.
- Probability of a girl (P(G)) = 1/2.

We are given that in 45 families, the sequence G B G B B G was observed. The probability of any specific sequence of 6 children with 3 boys and 3 girls happening is given by:
\[ P = \binom{6}{3} \times (1/2)^6 = 20 \times (1/64) = 20/64 = 5/16, \]
where \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) is the number of ways to arrange 3 boys and 3 girls in a sequence of 6.

The probability that a family of six children has the sequence B G B B B B (1 girl and 5 boys) is calculated as:
\[ P = \binom{6}{1} \times (1/2)^6 = 6 \times (1/64) = 6/64 = 3/32. \]

Now, if we know that there are 45 families with the pattern G B G B B G, and this pattern has the same probability as any other specific sequence of 3 boys and 3 girls, we can estimate the total number of surveyed families of 6, using the probability of having exactly 3 boys and 3 girls:
\[ \text{Total families with 6 children} = \frac{45}{5/16} = \frac{45 \times 16}{5} = 144. \]

Thus, the estimated number of families that would have the sequence B G B B B B:
\[ \text{Expected number of families with B G B B B B} = 144 \times \frac{3}{32} = 13.5 \approx 14. \]

Therefore, my estimate is:
