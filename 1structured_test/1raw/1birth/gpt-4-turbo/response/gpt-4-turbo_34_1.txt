To solve this problem, we use the assumption that each birth is independent, and the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (P(B) = P(G) = 0.5). The number of boys and girls and the order in which they are born varies.

1. For the sequence G B G B B G, there are three girls and three boys. The probability of any specific sequence of 3 boys and 3 girls in 6 births (such as G B G B B G) is given by:
   \[
   P(X) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
   \]
   where \(P(X)\) is the probability of any specific sequence occurring, given that there are 3 boys and 3 girls in 6 children.

2. Given that 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, this implies there were \(45/P(X) = 45 \times 64 = 2880\) families surveyed in total, as \(P(X)\) is \(1/64\) and you need the total to estimate other occurrences.

3. Now, consider the sequence B G B B B B, which contains 1 girl and 5 boys. The probability of getting this exact sequence is the same for any other sequence with one girl and five boys:
   \[
   P(Y) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
   \]
   
4. Therefore, the estimated number of families with this sequence B G B B B B among the 2880 surveyed is:
   \[
   N_{BGBBBB} = P(Y) \times 2880 = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45
   \]

{answer: 45}
