To solve this problem, we first need to consider the probability of any given sequence of six children being boys (B) or girls (G). Assuming the probability of a child being a boy or a girl is equal (1/2), and that the sex of each child is independent of the others, we calculate the probability of a specific sequence of 6 children.

The number of ways any sequence of 3 boys and 3 girls can occur in any family of 6 children can be calculated using the binomial coefficient formula: \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose k successes (boys, in this case) out of n total trials (children).

For the sequence G B G B B G (i.e., 3 girls and 3 boys), the probability is:
\[ P(\text{3 boys, 3 girls}) = \binom{6}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = 20 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
Here, \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\), since there are 20 ways to arrange 3 boys and 3 girls among 6 children. 

Given that 45 families out of the total surveyed had the sequence G B G B B G, we can find the total number of families surveyed by normalizing:
\[ \text{Total families} = \frac{45}{\left(\frac{20}{64}\right)} = \frac{45 \times 64}{20} = 144 \]
So, there were approximately 144 families surveyed.

For the sequence B G B B B B (5 boys, 1 girl), the number of such combinations \(\binom{6}{5} = 6\) ways. The probability of this sequence occurring is:
\[ P(\text{5 boys, 1 girl}) = \binom{6}{5} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = 6 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{6}{64} \]
Normalized to the total number of families surveyed:
\[ \text{Number of families with sequence B G B B B B} = 144 \times \frac{6}{64} = 13.5 \]
Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get 14. However, since exact results usually don't ask for rounding, we'll keep it at 13.5. So my estimate for the number of families where the sequence of births was B G B B B B is:
