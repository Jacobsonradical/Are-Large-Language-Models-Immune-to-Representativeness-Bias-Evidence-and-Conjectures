To estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information given about the survey and assume each of the possible sequences of six children births are equally likely. 

Since there are six spots where either a boy (B) or a girl (G) can be placed, there are a total of 64=2^6=64 possible orderings of boys and girls in families of six children.

Given:
- Probability (P) of any specific sequence = 1/64, as all sequences are equally likely,
- There were 45 families surveyed that had the specific sequence G B G B B G.

We can assume that similar probabilities would apply to other specific sequences. Let N be the total number of families surveyed.

From the given:
- P(G B G B B G) = 45/N = 1/64
- Solving for N gives N = 45 × 64 = 2880 total families surveyed.

Now to estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B (which is just as likely as any other given sequence):
- P(B G B B B B) = 1/64
- Expected number of families with this sequence = N × P(B G B B B B) = 2880 × 1/64 = 45

Thus, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
