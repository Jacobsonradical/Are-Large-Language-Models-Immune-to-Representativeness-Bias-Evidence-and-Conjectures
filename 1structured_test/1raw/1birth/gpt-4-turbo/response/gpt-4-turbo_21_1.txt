To estimate the number of families surveyed where the order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the concept of binomial probability because each birth is essentially a binomial trial where there are two outcomes: a boy (B) or a girl (G). Each outcome can be assumed to have a probability of 0.5 if there's no additional information about boy or girl birth likelihoods.

Given the order of boys and girls in the surveyed families is 6 births long, the number of different ways that 6 children can be sequenced in any specific arrangement of boys and girls is given by the binomial coefficient:

Number of ways = \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{6}{k}\)
where \(k\) is the number of boys.

For the order G B G B B G (2 girls and 4 boys):
\(\binom{6}{2} = \dfrac{6!}{2!4!} = \dfrac{720}{2 \times 24} = 15\)

The probability of this specific sequence occurring (since each sequence under the assumption of equal likelihood of boy or girl is \(0.5^6 = \frac{1}{64}\)) and there are 15 such combinations, gives a probability of \(15 \times \dfrac{1}{64} = \dfrac{15}{64}\).

If 45 families exactly match the sequence G B G B B G, this suggests:
Total estimated families surveyed \(= \dfrac{45}{\frac{15}{64}} = \dfrac{45 \times 64}{15} = 192\)

Now, let's estimate the sequence B G B B B B (1 girl and 5 boys):
\(\binom{6}{1} = \dfrac{6!}{1!5!} = \dfrac{720}{1 \times 120} = 6\)

Using the same basics as above where the probability of any specific sequence (like B G B B B B) again being \( \frac{1}{64} \) and having 6 such combinations gives a probability of \(6 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{6}{64} = \frac{3}{32}\).

So, estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is \(Total Families \times Probability = 192 \times \frac{3}{32} = 18\).

Hence, the estimate:
