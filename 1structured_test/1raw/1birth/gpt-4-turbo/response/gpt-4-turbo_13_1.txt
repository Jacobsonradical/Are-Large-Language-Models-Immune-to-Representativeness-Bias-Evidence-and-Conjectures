To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we apply the notion that each specific sequence of six children (such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B) has an equal probability of occurring under the assumption that each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, independently of the other children. Each child being born a boy or a girl can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial with p = 0.5 for either outcome, boy or girl.

Let's calculate the probability of any specific sequence with exactly k boys out of 6 births (k can range from 0 to 6). The probability \( P \) of a particular sequence of 6 births containing k boys (and therefore 6-k girls) is given by the binomial formula:
\[
P(k \text{ boys}) = \binom{6}{k} (0.5)^k (0.5)^{6-k} = \binom{6}{k} (0.5)^6
\]
Here, \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the number of ways to choose k successes (in this case, boys) in n trials (births).

Both sequences B G B B B B and G B G B B G contain exactly four boys and two girls. The binomial coefficient \(\binom{6}{4}\) is the number of ways to choose 4 boys out of 6 children:
\[
\binom{6}{4} = 15
\]
Each sequence has the same probability:
\[
P(4 \text{ boys}) = 15 \times (0.5)^6 = 15/64
\]
Given that there are 15 equally likely ways to get any specific sequence of 4 boys, and from the survey data, there were 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B also based on these probabilities.

Since the probability ratio between any two specific sequences with the same number of boys and girls is equal, we can estimate the count for our target sequence B G B B B B using a simple proportion:
\[
\text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \text{Number of families with G B G B B G}
\]
Hence, if there were 45 families with G B G B B G, our estimate for families with B G B B B B would also be 45.
