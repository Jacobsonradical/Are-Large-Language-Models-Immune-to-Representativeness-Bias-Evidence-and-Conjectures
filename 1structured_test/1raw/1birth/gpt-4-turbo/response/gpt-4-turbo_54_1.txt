To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we consider the binomial nature of the problem where the probability p of having a boy or a girl in each birth is assumed equal (p = 0.5 for a boy and p = 0.5 for a girl), under the assumption of equal likelihoods for each gender and independent births.

First, the number of occurrences of the sequence G B G B B G among families can be analyzed. The probability of this specific sequence occurring, under the given assumptions, is:

\[ P(G B G B B G) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \]

Now, given that there are 45 families where this sequence was observed, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (N) by setting up the equation based on our theoretical probability:

\[ 0.015625 \times N = 45 \]
\[ N = 45 / 0.015625 = 2880 \]

Now let's find the probability of the sequence B G B B B B occurring:

\[ P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \]

The number of families in which this order of births occurred is then estimated by:

\[ 0.015625 \times 2880 = 45 \]

Thus, the estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B using the estimated total population is:
