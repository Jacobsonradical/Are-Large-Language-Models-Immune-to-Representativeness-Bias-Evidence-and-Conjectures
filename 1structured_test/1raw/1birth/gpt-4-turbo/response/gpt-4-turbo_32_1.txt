To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B among the surveyed families, we can use the assumption of an equal probability for each gender at each birthâ€”that each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, and each birth order is equally likely.

1. **Understanding the Probability for Each Birth Order**:
   Each child being born a boy (B) or a girl (G) is independent of the births of other children, and each event (B or G) has a probability of 0.5. So the probability of any specific birth order, such as B G B B B B or G B G B B G, can be found by multiplying \(0.5\) for each boy and \(0.5\) for each girl in the sequence.

2. **Calculating for G B G B B G and B G B B B B**:
   - For G B G B B G, the number of boys = 3 and girls = 3.
   - For B G B B B B, the number of boys = 5 and girls = 1.
   
   The probability for any specific sequence where there are exactly k boys in 6 children is:
   \[
   P(\text{k boys in 6 births}) = \binom{6}{k} \times (0.5)^6
   \]
   Here, \(\binom{6}{k}\) represents the binomial coefficient, which gives the number of ways to arrange k boys among 6 children.

   - For G B G B B G (3 boys, 3 girls):
     \[
     P = \binom{6}{3} \times (0.5)^6 = 20 \times (0.5)^6 = 20 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{20}{64}
     \]
   
   - For B G B B B B (5 boys, 1 girl):
     \[
     P = \binom{6}{5} \times (0.5)^6 = 6 \times (0.5)^6 = 6 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{6}{64}
     \]

3. **Comparing the Probabilities**:
   Since each sequence (G B G B B G and B G B B B B) has an equal probability of occurrence, the relative frequencies in the sample should reflect their probabilities.
   
   If 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, then to find families with B G B B B B:
   \[
   \text{Expected ratio} = \frac{\text{Probability of B G B B B B}}{\text{Probability of G B G B B G}} = \frac{6/64}{20/64} = \frac{6}{20} = \frac{3}{10}
   \]
   Thus, the expected number of families with B G B B B B can be estimated proportionally:
   \[
   \text{Estimated families with B G B B B B} = 45 \times \frac{3}{10} = 13.5
   \]
   We round this off to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   \text{Estimated families} = 14
   \]
