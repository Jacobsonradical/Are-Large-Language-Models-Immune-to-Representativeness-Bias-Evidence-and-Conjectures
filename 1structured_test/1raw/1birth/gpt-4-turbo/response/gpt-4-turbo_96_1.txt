To find the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we'll use probability and the combinatorial approach on the given data.

The number of boys and girls in the sequence G B G B B G is 3 boys and 3 girls. The probability of this sequence happening under the assumption that all gender outcomes are equally likely (which is often considered to be 1/2 for boys and 1/2 for girls and each birth is independent), can be calculated as follows:
\[ P = (1/2)^6 = 1/64 \]

Given that there are 45 families found with the order of births G B G B B G, we estimate the total number of families surveyed, assuming the model of independent births where each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl. If the probability of any specific sequence of 3 boys and 3 girls occurring is \(1/64\), and 45 families have one specific order G B G B B G, then the total number of families, N, can be estimated by:
\[ N \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, looking for the sequence B G B B B B:
- The number of boys and girls in this sequence is 5 boys and 1 girl, and the probability of this specific sequence occurring is also calculated as:
\[ P = (1/2)^6 = 1/64 \]

Since the total number of estimated families is 2880 and the number of families with this specific distributrion (5 boys, 1 girl) is also governed by this probability:
\[ Number\ of\ families\ with\ BGBBBB = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]
So, 45 families are estimated to have the birth order B G B B B B.
