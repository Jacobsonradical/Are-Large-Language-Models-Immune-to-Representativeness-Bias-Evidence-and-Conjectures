To solve this, we'll first estimate the probability of any given order of six children being either all boys (B) or all girls (G). Assuming the probability of having a boy or a girl are each 1/2, independent of other births,

The probability of any specific order of 6 children, like G B G B B G, is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Given that there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and knowing that this order is just one of the possible 2^6 = 64 different sequences of six children, we can deduce something about the total number of families surveyed.

Total families × Probability of specific order (like G B G B B G) = Number of families reported with that order
Total families × 1/64 = 45
Total families = 45 × 64 = 2880

So, the total number of families surveyed is 2880.

Now, we'll find the number of families in which the birth order was B G B B B B. This sequence has the same probability, (1/2)^6 = 1/64, as any other specific order of births sequence. So, the number of families with the order B G B B B B will also be roughly:
Total families × Probability of B G B B B B = 2880 × 1/64 = 45

Hence, my estimate is:
{answer: 45}
