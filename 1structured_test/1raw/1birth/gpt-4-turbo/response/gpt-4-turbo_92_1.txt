To calculate the probability of any specific sequence of six children being all boys (B) or all girls (G), we first need to acknowledge that each child is independently a boy or a girl. We also assume that the probability of each child being a boy or a girl is equal (1/2 for boy and 1/2 for girl), under a simple and common model ignoring any biological/environmental influence.

Now the sequence in the case in question (G B G B B G) can occur with probability:
\[ P = (1/2)^6 = 1/64 \]
because there are six children, and each has two possible outcomes (either matching the specific gender in that position of the sequence or not).

Given that there were 45 families that had children in the exact order of G B G B B G:
- Total probability for this order = 1/64
- Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed.

Then, we can assume that
\[ N \times (1/64) = 45 \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]
So, \( N \) is our estimated total number of families surveyed.

The question now asks for the number of such surveys where the sequence was B G B B B B.
- Probability of this specific order is also \( (1/2)^6 = 1/64 \), from the same reasoning as above.

The expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be:
\[ \text{Expected number of B G B B B B} = N \times (1/2)^6 = 2880 \times 1/64 = 45 \]

Thus, our estimate is:
{answer: 45}
