To solve the problem, we can use the assumption of equal likelihood of boy (B) and girl (G) birth for simplicity, similar to flipping a fair coin. Thus, each child being a boy or a girl has a probability of \( \frac{1}{2} \).

1. **Calculate the probability of the sequence G B G B B G in a family of six children**:
   - The sequence G B G B B G consists of three girls and three boys.
   - The probability of any specific arrangement of three girls and three boys is:
     \[
     \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
     \]
   since each birth is independent, and each child being a boy or a girl happens with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Given this, and knowing that 45 families had the exact sequence G B G B B G**:
   - Letâ€™s denote the total number of families surveyed as \( N \).
   - Using the probability of this specific sequence being \( \frac{1}{64} \), we set up the equation:
     \[
     45 = N \times \frac{1}{64}
     \]
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]
   So \( N = 2880 \) is the total number of families surveyed.

3. **Calculate the probability of the sequence B G B B B B**:
   - This sequence also consists of one girl and five boys.
   - Similar to the above, the probability of any specific sequence of one girl and five boys is:
     \[
     \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
     \]

4. **Estimate the number of families where the sequence of children is B G B B B B**:
   - With total families being 2880, and the probability of the sequence B G B B B B being \( \frac{1}{64} \):
     \[
     2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45
     \]

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed where the exact order of births was B G B B B B is also 45.
