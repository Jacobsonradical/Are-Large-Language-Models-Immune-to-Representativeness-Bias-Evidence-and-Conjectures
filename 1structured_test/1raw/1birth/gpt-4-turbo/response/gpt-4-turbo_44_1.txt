To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, I'll use the fact that each distinct order of 6 children with a specified number of boys and girls has equal probability under simple assumptions of each child independently being a boy or a girl with equal probability (50% chance each).

The number of B and G in both scenarios (where the surveyed sequence is G B G B B G and the sequence to estimate is B G B B B B) needs to be examined. Both sequences consist of 4 boys and 2 girls. 

To find the probability of any specific sequence of 4 boys and 2 girls occurring:
- There are \(\binom{6}{4}\) different ways to arrange 4 boys and 2 girls, which equals 15 different sequences.

If one specific sequence (G B G B B G) has resulted in 45 families, and assuming that all such sequences are equally likely (all 15 sequences of 4 boys and 2 girls), we can estimate the total number of families with 4 boys and 2 girls as:
- \(15 \times \text{number of families in one sequence} = 15 \times 45 = 675\) families.

Thus, under the assumption of equal likelihood, the estimated number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 
- \(45\) families (retaining proportionality among all 15 sequences).

Hence, the estimate:
