To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was BGBBBB, we can utilize a basic understanding of probability and combinations. Since we're dealing with sequences of 6 children, each child can independently be a boy (B) or girl (G) with equal probability in a simple model where the probability of having a boy or a girl is the same (1/2). 

Given:
- There are 6 children in each family.
- In each position in the sequence, there is an event (either a boy or a girl) that occurs with a probability of 1/2. 

The number of sequences that match a specific pattern (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) can be found by calculating (1/2)^6, which is the probability of any specific sequence of 6 children happening, such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B:
\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Assuming that both sequences (G B G B B G and B G B B B B) are equally probable (which holds under the assumption of equal probability of boy or girl and independence of each birth):

1. The probability for each sequence to occur is the same, \(\frac{1}{64}\).
2. The survey results report 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G.

We can estimate the total number of surveyed families by determining how many families we would expect to display this sequence out of a larger population, using the known ratio:

\[ \frac{45}{\text{Total Families}} = \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ \text{Total Families} = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Hence, the estimated total number of families in the survey is 2880. To find the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B:
\[ \text{Expected Families with B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.
