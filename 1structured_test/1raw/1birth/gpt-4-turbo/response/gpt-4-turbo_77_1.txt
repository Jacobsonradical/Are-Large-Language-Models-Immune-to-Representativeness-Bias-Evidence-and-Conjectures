To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we first need to look at the probability of each specific sequence occurring under the assumption that the probability of a child being a boy or girl is equal (1/2 each) and that each birth is independent.

The sequence G B G B B G that occurred in 45 families involves 3 boys and 3 girls. The probability of this sequence happening is:
\[ P(G B G B B G) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

The sequence B G B B B B involves 5 boys and 1 girl. The probability of this sequence occurring is also:
\[ P(B G B B B B) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Since the probability of both sequences (G B G B B G and B G B B B B) occurring is the same and the population surveyed might be considered uniformly exposed to equal chance sequences (assuming equal probability of boy and girl births), the number of families in which each specific sequence of sexes happens should be proportional based on these probabilities if all possibilities are equally likely. 

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G:
\[ \text{Let } X \text{ be the total number of families.} \]
\[ \frac{45}{X} = \frac{1}{64} \]

From there, assuming that the possible sequences are equiprobable, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B can be approximated by considering that these two sequences have an equal likelihood:
\[ 45 \text{ families }(B G B B B B) \]

So, given the same probability for each sequence, and there are 45 families with one sequence, we can estimate the same number for the other sequence:
