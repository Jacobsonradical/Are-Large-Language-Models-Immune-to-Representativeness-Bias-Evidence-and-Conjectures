To estimate the number of families surveyed where the birth order was B G B B B B based on the provided information, we start by understanding probabilities in sequences of births assuming each child born has an independent 50% chance of being a boy (B) and 50% chance of being a girl (G). 

The probability of any specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) occurring is given by calculating \( (1/2)^6 = 1/64 \), since each child is an independent event, and there are 6 children.

The 45 families where the sequence was G B G B B G represent occurrences of that particular sequence. Thus, if sequences are uniformly likely, about 1/64 of all six-child families should result in this sequence.

If there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G out of a total number T of six-child families, we can set up a proportion, given that both sequences have the same probability of occurrence:

\[
\frac{45}{T} = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Solving for T:

\[
T = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

Now, estimating the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B:

\[
\text{Estimated number of families with sequence B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45
\]

Thus, according to our model and the provided data:
