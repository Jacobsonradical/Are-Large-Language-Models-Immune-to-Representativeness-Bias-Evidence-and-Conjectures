To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was BGBBBB, we can use the information given about the order GBBGBG where 45 families had that specific sequence. We assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is the same (50% for each), and that each sequence of boys and girls is equally likely.

Since a sequence has 6 children, there are 2^6 = 64 possible sequences of boys and girls. Given that each sequence is equally likely under the assumption of gender having a 50% probability each, the probability of any specific sequence occurring is 1/64.

The occurrence of 45 families having the GBBGBG order suggests that approximately 1/64 of the families might have any particular sequence. Hence, we can set up the proportion based on the result that there are 64 possible sequences, and there are 45 families out of the total surveyed that had the sequence GBBGBG.

If we let N be the total number of families surveyed, then by estimating,
1/64 * N = 45. 

We solve for N:
N = 45 * 64 = 2880.

Assuming similar distribution for other sequences, the estimate for the number of families with the sequence BGBBBB would also be 1/64 * N:
1/64 * 2880 = 45.

Hence, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was BGBBBB is also 45.
