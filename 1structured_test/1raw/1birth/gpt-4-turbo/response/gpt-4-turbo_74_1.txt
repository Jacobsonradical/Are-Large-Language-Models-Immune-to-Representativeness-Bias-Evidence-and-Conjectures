To solve this, we'll use the assumption that each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, and that these outcomes are independent. The probability of any given sequence of genders for six children is thus \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that the sequence G B G B B G appeared in 45 families, we assume this reflects the probability of any specific sequence occurring.

Let's calculate the expected number of families for another specific sequence, B G B B B B:
- Each family has an equal probability \(\frac{1}{64}\) of having children in the order B G B B B B.
- Let \(N\) be the total number of families surveyed. The expected number of families with the order B G B B B B is, thus, \(N \times \frac{1}{64}\).

We know from the information given:
\[N \times \frac{1}{64} = 45\]
This represents the families with the order G B G B B G, and because each sequence is equally probable, it applies to B G B B B B as well. Thus, the estimate for the number of families surveyed with the order B G B B B B is also 45.
