To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we start by noting that each possible sequence of 6 children, where each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), is an independent event. Given that the probability of each child being a boy or a girl is typically assumed to be 0.5 (assuming equal likelihood of giving birth to a boy or a girl), every specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) has the same probability.

The probability of any specific order of 6 children where p is the probability of a boy and (1-p) is the probability of a girl can be calculated as \(p^b (1-p)^g\) where \(b\) is the number of boys and \(g\) is the number of girls. For a sequence of G B G B B G, which consists of 3 boys and 3 girls, the probability is \(0.5^3 \times 0.5^3 = 0.5^6\). Similarly, for a sequence of B G B B B B, consisting of 5 boys and 1 girl, the probability is also \(0.5^5 \times 0.5^1 = 0.5^6\).

Given that both sequences have the same probability and there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can project that there are similarly 45 families with the sequence B G B B B B, because each sequence of gender across six children is equally probable in a large enough sample, assuming random and independent gender distribution with equal probabilities.

Therefore, the estimate is:
