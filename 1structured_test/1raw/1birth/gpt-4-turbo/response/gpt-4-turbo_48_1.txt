To estimate the number of families where the order of births was BGBBBB, we can use the information provided about the order G B G B B G.

Given that the children are equally likely to be boys or girls, each gender has a probability of \( p = \frac{1}{2} \). For any specific order of six children, such as G B G B B G, the probability of this exact sequence occurring is:

\[
p(\text{specific order}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Since there are 45 families where the exact order was G B G B B G, and knowing that each sequence of genders (since there are 6 children) occurs with probability \(1/64\), we can infer the total number of families by setting up the proportion:

\[
\frac{45}{1/64} = Total \quad Current\quad Families
\]

Thus:

\[
Total\quad Families = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

Now, to find the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we recognize that this sequence also has the probability \(1/64\) of occurring because it too has 6 specified slots, each with a boy or girl having a \(1/2\) chance in each position, like any specific predetermined sequence of six births. Therefore, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be:

\[
\text{Expected families for B G B B B B } = \frac{1}{64}\times 2880 = 45
\]

Thus, our estimate is:
