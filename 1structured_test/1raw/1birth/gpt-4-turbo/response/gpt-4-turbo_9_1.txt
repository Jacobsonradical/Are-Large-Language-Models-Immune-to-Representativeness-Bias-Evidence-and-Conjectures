To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was BGBBBB, we can use the information given about the surveyed families with the birth order of GBGBBG. We assume that each birth is independent and the probability of a child being a boy or a girl is the same (50% chance for each).

There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible ways to have 6 children where each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl. Each specific order of genders (like GBGBBG or BGBBBB) has a probability of \(\frac{1}{64}\) of occurring.

Given that 45 families had the order GBGBBG, we can establish a rough proportionality:
- If 64 different sequences are equally likely, and the sample has found 45 families with one particular sequence out of 64 possible sequences, then it is reasonable to estimate that population surveyed consists of about \(64 \times 45 = 2880\) families, assuming roughly uniform distribution over all sequences.

Applying the same reasoning to another specific sequence (BGBBBB), since there's also only 1 out of 64 chance for any particular sequence, we could estimate that there are also about 45 families with the sequence BGBBBB in the surveyed population.

Thus:
{answer: 45}
