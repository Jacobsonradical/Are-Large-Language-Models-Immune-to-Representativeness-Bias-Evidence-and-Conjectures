To solve this problem, we will assume that the probability of a child being born a boy or a girl is independent of their siblings' genders, and we will assume an equal probability of 1/2 for each gender.

In the case of the birth order G B G B B G, we have the exact probability for this sequence:
\[ P(G B G B B G) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this to estimate the total number of six-child families surveyed:
Let \( N \) be the total number of six-child families surveyed. From the given information,
\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Next, we calculate the probability of the sequence B G B B B B happening:
\[ P(B G B B B B) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Now, we estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B among those surveyed based on the calculated total number \( N \):
\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = N \times P(B G B B B B) = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Thus, we estimate that there are also 45 families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

{answer: 45}
