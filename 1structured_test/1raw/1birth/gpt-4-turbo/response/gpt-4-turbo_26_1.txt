To solve this problem, we can use the concept of binomial probabilities, assuming that the probability of a child being born a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for a boy, 0.5 for a girl) and that each birth is independent of the others.

Consider \( p \) as the probability of one specific sequence of births (either all boys, all girls, or any mixed sequence). For a sequence of six children, the probability \( p \) of any specific sequence where there are \( k \) boys and \( n-k \) girls (where \( n \) is total number of children, here 6) is given by:
\[
p = 0.5^n = 0.5^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]
This is because each child independently has a \( \frac{1}{2} \) chance of being a boy or a girl, and there are 6 children.

Given that \( p \) for any particular order (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is the same (\( \frac{1}{64} \)), we can estimate the total number of families surveyed if we know how many families have one particular sequence.

From the problem:
- Number of families with sequence G B G B B G = 45
- Probability of sequence G B G B B G = \( \frac{1}{64} \)

Assuming the ratio for any specific sequence to total number families surveyed is consistent, we use the known number to estimate the total:
\[
\text{Total number of families surveyed} = \text{Number of specific sequence} / p = 45 / \frac{1}{64} = 45 \times 64
\]

This calculation works under the assumption that surveying one sequence is representative for all of them. To find the estimate for the sequence B G B B B B:
- Probability of B G B B B B = \( \frac{1}{64} \) (the same for any sequence)

Assuming similar ratios across all sequence types:
\[
\text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \text{Total number of families surveyed} \times p = (45 \times 64) \times \frac{1}{64}
\]
\[ 
= 45
\]
Therefore, we estimate that the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is also 45.
