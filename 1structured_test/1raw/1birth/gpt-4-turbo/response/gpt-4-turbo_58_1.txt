To estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the data for the births G B G B B G and the underlying assumption that each child's sex is equally likely to be a boy or a girl (50% chance of being either). The probability model often assumed in such cases is that the births are independent and identically distributed with a probability of \( \frac{1}{2} \) for each sex.

1. Calculate the probability of any specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B). Since each child is independently a boy or a girl:
   \[
   P(\text{Specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
   \]

2. The sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families. Since each specific sequence has the same probability, the number of families where B G B B B B occurred will theoretically be the same, assuming that all sequences are equally likely and the sample is large enough for equal distribution.

3. Therefore, the estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.

This estimate assumes that the order of births is random and follows the laws of probability without bias or other influencing factors. 
Additionally, we assume the number of surveyed families is large enough to evenly distribute all possible birth orders.

So, the final response would be:
{answer: 45}
