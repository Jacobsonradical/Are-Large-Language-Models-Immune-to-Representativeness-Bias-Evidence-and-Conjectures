To answer this question, we need to understand the probabilities involved in the birth sequences and how they relate to each other. Since no gender bias information is given, it is assumed that the probability of a child being a boy or a girl is equal (1/2 for each), and that the births are independent events.

1. **Probability Calculation:**
   The probability of any specific order of six children can be calculated as:
   \[
   P(\text{sequence}) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64
   \]

2. **Given Condition:**
   The sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families.

3. **Estimating the Probabilities:**
   Since all specific sequences of six children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) have the same probability (1/64), we expect similar numbers of families to have other sequences if the sample size and distribution are uniform with respect to gender birth.

4. **Expected Number of Families:**
   Since we know that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate that roughly the same number of families would have the sequence B G B B B B, as it has an equal probability of occurring.

   Hence, the estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 45, based on the assumption of equal likelihood and independent birth events.
