To solve this problem, we can use the principles of probability, assuming each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl, and that each birth is independent of the others. The probability of a specific sequence of genders among six children (such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B) can be calculated if each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl.

The probability \( p \) of any particular child being a boy or a girl is \( \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, the probability of any specific sequence of six children, where we know the gender of each child, is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \), because there are six events and each event (birth) has two outcomes (boy or girl).

Given that the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed, \( N \), by the equation:
\[ N \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, we can use \( N \) to estimate the number of families in which the birth sequence was B G B B B B. Since each six-child sequence has the same probability (\(1/64)\) by our earlier calculation, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:
\[ N \times \frac{1}{64} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Thus, we estimate that in 45 families, the exact order of births of boys and girls was B G B B B B.

{answer: 45}
