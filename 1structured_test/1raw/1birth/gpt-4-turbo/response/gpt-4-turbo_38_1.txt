To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we use the assumption that each child being a boy (B) or a girl (G) is an independent event with a probability of 1/2 for each gender. The probability of any exact sequence of births (e.g., G B G B B G or B G B B B B) occurring is the same for every specific sequence consisting of the same number of boys and girls.

In this case:

1. For G B G B B G, the arrangement has 3 boys and 3 girls. The probability of this happening in any one family is:
   \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\)

2. Since the same reasoning applies to any other sequence of six with exactly three boys and three girls, including B G B B B B:
   - P(B G B B B B) = \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\)

Given that there are 45 families with the exact sequence G B G B B G, and assuming each specific sequence of three boys and three girls is equally likely, then the number of families exhibiting the sequence B G B B B B would be expected to be similarly proportional to all possible sequences of 3 boys and 3 girls.

There are \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) different sequences in which 3 boys and 3 girls can be arranged. Given that these sequences are equally likely, the observed number in one sequence (45 from the sequence G B G B B G) can suggest the total number of families surveyed.

Total families surveyed could be computed as \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \) for the equally likely assumption to hold.

Thus, since each sequence type is equally likely:
   - Expected number of families with B G B B B B would be 900/20 = 45.

However, this derivation shows only a rough estimate based on assuming equal distribution among all possible sequences of 3 boys and 3 girls. Variations might occur due to actual distribution and preferences, but with the provided assumptions, this is a reasonable estimation.
