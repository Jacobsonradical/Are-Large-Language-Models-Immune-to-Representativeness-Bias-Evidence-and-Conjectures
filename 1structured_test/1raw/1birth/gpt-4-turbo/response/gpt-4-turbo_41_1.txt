To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the binomial probability model because each sequence of children can be modeled as sequences of independent Bernoulli trials (birth of a boy or a girl).

Let's assume that the probability of each child being a boy or a girl is equal, i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{2} \) for a girl and \( p = \frac{1}{2} \) for a boy.

1. For the sequence G B G B B G:
   - Number of girls (G) = 3 
   - Number of boys (B) = 3
   - The probability of having exactly this order (P1) = \((\frac{1}{2})^6 = \frac{1}{64}\)

2. For the sequence B G B B B B:
   - Number of girls (G) = 1
   - Number of boys (B) = 5
   - The probability of having exactly this order (P2) = \((\frac{1}{2})^6 = \frac{1}{64}\)

Both sequences have the same probability of occurring under the assumption of equal likelihood of boy or girl births. This means we can use the number of families reporting one sequence to estimate the number of families reporting the other sequence if the total number of families surveyed is large enough for the rare event probabilities to stabilize around their expected values.

Since there are 45 families that reported the sequence G B G B B G, we estimate that there are similarly 45 families that reported the sequence B G B B B B, based on equal probability:
