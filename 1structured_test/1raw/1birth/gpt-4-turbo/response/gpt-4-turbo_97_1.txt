To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we first need to consider how we can use the information provided about the order G B G B B G in 45 families.

The probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is typically assumed to be equal (1/2 for each), and the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The total probability of any specific sequence of 6 births (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is:
\[ P = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

This means that each specific sequence of 6 children (in terms of gender) has a probability of 1/64 of occurring. Given that the sequence G B G B B G was observed in 45 families, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed.

Let \( n \) be the total number of families surveyed.
\[ \frac{n}{64} \approx 45 \]
\[ n \approx 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, to find the estimated number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we assume the same probability for this sequence as for any other specific sequence:
\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

The estimate for both sequences should ideally be similar since both are equally probable under the assumption of boys and girls being equally likely and births being independent.

Thus:
{answer: 45}
