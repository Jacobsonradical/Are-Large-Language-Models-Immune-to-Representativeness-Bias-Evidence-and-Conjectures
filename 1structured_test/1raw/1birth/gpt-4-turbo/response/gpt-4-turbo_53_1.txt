To estimate the number of families with the order BGBBBB, we must understand the probability of any specific sequence of six children occurring, assuming that all sequences are equally likely.

Given:
- Probability of a boy (B) = 1/2
- Probability of a girl (G) = 1/2

The probability of any specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) where each child is independently either a boy or a girl, both with probability 1/2, is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

If there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, it implies that:
- Total expected families = Total number of such occurrences / Probability of any specific sequence of 6 children
- Total number of such occurrences for G B G B B G = 45 / (1/64) = 45 * 64 = 2880 families

Since the probability of occurrence of any specific sequence is the same, we can assume the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would also be proportional to this likelihood:
- Expected number of occurrences for B G B B B B = 2880 * (1/64) = 45

Thus, an estimate for the number of families surveyed where the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.
