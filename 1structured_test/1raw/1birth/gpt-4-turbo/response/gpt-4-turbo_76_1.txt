To estimate the number of families where the birth order was B G B B B B, we can apply some basic probability principles derived from the number of observed families where the birth order was G B G B B G.

First, assuming the probability of a child being born a boy (B) or a girl (G) is roughly equal (1/2 for each), the probability of any specific sequence of six children, such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B, in which the number of boys and girls are the same, would also be the same.

The sequence G B G B B G contains three girls and three boys. The sequence B G B B B B contains five boys and one girl. Since each child is independently a boy or girl with probability 1/2:

- Probability of sequence like G B G B B G = (1/2)^6 = 1/64
- Probability of sequence like B G B B B B = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

They have equal probability occurrences since the number of occurrences is affected only by the number of boys and girls when their individual probabilities are equal.

Now, if in the city there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, and the probability of any specific sequence of three boys and three girls occurring is the same, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B (four boys and two girls) would be constructed similarly.

Given that we saw 45 families with one such specific sequence, and knowing the population might similarly reflect other sequences (with different numbers of boys and girls), we should adjust for how many such sequences exist for each case. 

With a sequence fixed to three boys and three girls:
- Number of ways to choose 3 boys places out of 6 = 6 choose 3 = 20

With a sequence fixed to five boys and one girl:
- Number of ways to choose 1 girl place out of 6 = 6 choose 1 = 6

If we found 45 families with one specific pattern among the 20 equally likely 3-boys-3-girls patterns, we might expect the frequency of each pattern to be similar across other total patterns. Since the total number of 5-boys-1-girl patterns (6) is less than the number of 3-boys-3-girls patterns (20), each 5-boys-1-girl pattern should be proportionately less likely to appear - assuming families with different gender distributions are equally likely.

Using that proportionality:
\[ \text{Proportion} = \frac{6}{20} = 0.3 \]
\[ \text{Expected number of families} = 45 \times \frac{6}{20} = 13.5 \]

Since the number of families cannot be fractional and estimates need to be a whole number, the best estimate would be that around 14 families had the birth sequence B G B B B B.
