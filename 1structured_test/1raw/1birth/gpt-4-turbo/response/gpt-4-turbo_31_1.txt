To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we must first understand the probability of any specific sequence of six children being either boys (B) or girls (G). Assuming the probability of a child being a girl (G) or a boy (B) is 1/2, and that each birth is independent:

1. Probability of any specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B):
   P = (1/2)^6 
      = 1/64

The sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families. Assuming the families surveyed are a representative sample, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed (N):
   
   Probability of G B G B B G = 1/64 (each specific sequence has equal probability)
   Expected number of families with this sequence = N × 1/64
   Given that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G,
   N × 1/64 = 45
   N = 45 × 64
   N = 2880

Now, to estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we use the same probability:
   
   Expected number of families with B G B B B B = Total surveyed families × Probability of B G B B B B 
                                            = 2880 × 1/64
                                            = 45

Thus, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.
