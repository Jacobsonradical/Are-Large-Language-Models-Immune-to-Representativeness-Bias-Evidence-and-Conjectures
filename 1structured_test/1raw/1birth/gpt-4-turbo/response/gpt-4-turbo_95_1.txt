To solve this problem, we apply the principle that each child being born a girl (G) or boy (B) is an independent event, assuming that the probability of each gender is 50%. Each specific order of births has the same probability under this assumption.

Given:
- Order G B G B B G has occurred in 45 families.

Each sequence of 6 births (where the order matters and each child can be either B or G) has the same probability of occurring:
\[ P = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible outcomes of 6 births (each child can be either B or G). So the probability of any specific sequence of 6 children, such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B, is \(\frac{1}{64}\).

If G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we assume that the number of families surveyed is large enough that all sequences are approximately equally probable. Therefore, a sequence with the same number of boys and girls, but in a different order, like B G B B B B, should also occur with roughly the same frequency of 45 families under uniform probability distribution.

Therefore, our estimate is:
{answer: 45}
