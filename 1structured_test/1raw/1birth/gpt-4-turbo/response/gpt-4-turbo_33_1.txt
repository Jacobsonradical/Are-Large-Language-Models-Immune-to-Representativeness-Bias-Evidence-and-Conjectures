To estimate the number of families surveyed where the exact birth order was B G B B B B, we can use the fact that each sequence of genders among the six children is equally likely, if we assume that the probability of a child being a boy or a girl is equal (1/2), and the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of any specific sequence of six children (for example, G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is:
\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

If there are 45 families that have the specific birth order of G B G B B G, we can infer that each such specific sequence occurs approximately 45 times in the surveyed population. Therefore, for any such specific order like B G B B B B with the same probability of occurring, the estimated number of families is also likely to be around 45.

Thus, my estimate is:
{answer: 45}
