To solve this problem, we can use the fact that each child born is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, independent of other births, and each position in the sequence of six children can be either a boy or a girl. Hence, the probability of any specific sequence of boys and girls (like G B G B B G) happening is the same.

The number of different sequences of 6 children where exactly 3 are boys and 3 are girls is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{6}{3}\) because we are choosing 3 positions out of 6 to be boys. The total possible outcomes of six child births where each child can be either boy or girl is \(2^6\), but since here we only focus on the sequences with exactly three of each gender, the relevant subset of outcomes has size \(\binom{6}{3}\).

\(\binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\).

Each specific sequence of 3 boys and 3 girls (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) occurs precisely once in these 20 outcomes. Therefore, the probability of any specific sequence of 3 boys and 3 girls is \(\frac{1}{20}\).

Since 45 families had births in the sequence of G B G B B G, we assume under the model where each sequence has a \(\frac{1}{20}\) probability, that the total surveyed population size is about 20 times the number observed for any particular sequence.

If 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G:
\(\text{Total number of families} = 45 \times 20 = 900\).

Therefore, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should also be:
\(\frac{1}{20} \times 900 = 45\).

So, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
