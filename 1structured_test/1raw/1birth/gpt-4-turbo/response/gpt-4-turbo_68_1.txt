To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we start from the data given for the birth order G B G B B B. Each specific sequence of 6 children (consisting of any arrangement of 3 boys and 3 girls) should be equally likely. 

For any sequence of 6 children containing exactly 3 boys and 3 girls, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) such sequences (since we choose 3 positions out of 6 for either boys or girls). Since each sequence occurs with equal likelihood, and given that there were 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, it suggests that roughly 1/20 of the families with 3 boys and 3 girls have any particular sequence. 

Assuming that the overall likelihood of having 3 boys and 3 girls is roughly equal for any defined sequence of 3 boys and 3 girls, we can project that there would also be approximately 45 families with the birth order B G B B B B, as each specific sequence is equally likely if births are independent and the gender of each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl.

Thus,
{answer: 45}
