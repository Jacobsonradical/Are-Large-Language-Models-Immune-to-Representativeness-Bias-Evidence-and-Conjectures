To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was BGBBBB, we can use the probability of specific sequences of gender births and compare it to the sequence given in the problem (G B G B B G). Assuming each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl (probability of a boy = 0.5, probability of a girl = 0.5), the probability of any specific order of six children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is the same. 

Since the sequence probability is the same for any order, the probability for each specific sequence of six children (like BGBBBB or GBGBBG) is:
\[ P = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \]
This implies that all sequences of six children are equally likely.

Since there are 45 families with the GBGBBG sequence, and assuming that any specific sequence is as likely as any other, we can estimate the number of families with the BGBBBB sequence to also be 45, under the assumption of equal likelihood and independent probability of the sex of each child.

Hence, the estimated number of families in which the exact order of births was BGBBBB is:
{answer: 45}
