To estimate the number of families surveyed with the specific birth order B G B B B B, we need to assume that the probability of each child being a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each), and thereby each sequence of boy-girl births is equally likely.

The total number of different sequences for six children where each child can either be a boy or a girl is \(2^6 = 64\). This is because each child can be either a boy or a girl, and there are six children, so there are 2 choices for each of the 6 births.

Given that each of these 64 sequences is equally likely, the expected number of families with any particular sequence (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) should be the same. We know from the problem statement that there are 45 families where the birth order is G B G B B G. Since this is one particular sequence out of 64 possible sequences and assuming each sequence is equally likely, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families.

Thus, if 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G out of a total of \(n\) families, and each of the 64 sequences should statistically occur the same number of times in a large enough sample, we can estimate \(n\) by assuming that the 45 families represent \(1/64\) of the total, because every sequence is equally likely.
\[ \frac{n}{64} = 45 \]
\[ n = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

So there are approximately 2880 families in total. Given that, the number of families expected to have the sequence B G B B B B (which is just as likely as any other sequence) should also be:
\[ \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, we estimate that there are 45 families where the birth order was B G B B B B.
