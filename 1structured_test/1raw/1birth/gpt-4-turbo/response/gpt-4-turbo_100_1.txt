To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, let's assume that the probability of a child being a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equal, which is usually a usual assumption unless stated otherwise. That is, \( P(B) = 0.5 \) and \( P(G) = 0.5 \), and each birth is independent of the others.

1. First, calculate the probability of the birth order G B G B B G:
   \( P(G B G B B G) = P(G) \times P(B) \times P(G) \times P(B) \times P(B) \times P(G) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \).
   
2. Because 45 families had the exact birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed, \( N \), by setting up the equation:
   \( 0.015625 \times N = 45 \)
   \( N = \frac{45}{0.015625} = 2880 \) families.

3. Now estimate how many of these 2880 families had the birth order B G B B B B:
   \( P(B G B B B B) = P(B) \times P(G) \times P(B) \times P(B) \times P(B) \times P(B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \) (same as before because the order is just different, but the number of boys and girls is the same).
   
4. Thus, the expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
   \( 0.015625 \times 2880 = 45 \).

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is also 45.
