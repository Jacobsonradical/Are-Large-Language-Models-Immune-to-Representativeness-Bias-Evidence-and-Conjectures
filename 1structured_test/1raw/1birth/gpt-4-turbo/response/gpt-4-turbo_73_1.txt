To estimate the number of families surveyed where the exact order of births was BGBBBB, we can use the concept of binomial distribution, given the assumption that the likelihood of having a boy or a girl is equal (50% chance for each).

We'll first calculate the probability of the sequence G B G B B G occurring and then use the ratio of this occurrence to estimate the likelihood of the sequence B G B B B B.

1. The probability of any specific sequence of six children, such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B, assuming that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is 50% for each child, is:
   \[ P(sequence) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64. \]

2. We know that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G.
    \[ Number \ of \ families \ with \ G B G B B G = 45. \]

3. Since we calculated that the probability of any specific birth order occurring is 1/64, and 45 families have one specific birth sequence:
    \[ Total \ number \ of \ families \ surveyed = 45 / (1/64) = 45 * 64 = 2880. \]

4. The probability of the sequence B G B B B B occurring is also 1/64 (as any specific sequence of six children). 

5. Now, estimating the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B:
   \[ Number \ of \ families \ with \ B G B B B B = Total \ number \ of \ families * Probability \ of \ B G B B B B = 2880 * (1/64) = 45. \]

{answer: 45}
