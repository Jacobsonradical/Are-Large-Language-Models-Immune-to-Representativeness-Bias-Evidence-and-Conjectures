To find the estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we'll use probability and inference based on the data given.

1. First, let's assume the probability of giving birth to a boy or a girl is equally likely, \( p = 0.5 \) for a boy and \( 1-p = 0.5 \) for a girl.

2. The probability of any specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is \((0.5)^6 = 0.015625\).

3. From the data: In 45 families, the specific order G B G B B G occurred. Using this, let's estimate the total number of families surveyed, using the probability of that specific order. If \(T\) is the total number of families,
   \[
   0.015625 \times T = 45
   \]
   Solving for \(T\),
   \[
   T = \frac{45}{0.015625} = 2880 \text{ families}
   \]

4. Now, we want to estimate the number of families where the exact order was B G B B B B. Since each specific sequence of genders has the same probability, the expected number of families with order B G B B B B should also be
   \[
   0.015625 \times 2880 = 45
   \]

Given these assumptions, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B would logically also be 45, just as with the order G B G B B G.
