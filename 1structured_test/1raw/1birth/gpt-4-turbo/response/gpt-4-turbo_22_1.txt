To approach this probability problem, we start by assuming that the occurrence of a boy or a girl in any given birth is a random event. Let us assume a simple model where each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, thus each has a probability of 0.5.

Given this, each unique sequence of 6 births (where each birth results in either a boy or a girl), will have a probability of (0.5)^6 to occur, since each child being a boy or a girl is an independent event with probability 0.5. The probability of any specific sequence of 6 births that includes particular boys and girls in a specific order is therefore 1 / 2^6 = 1 / 64.

From the problem, we know there are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G. Assuming the occurrence of any specific birth order is equally likely, there are 64 different birth orders that six children can have (since each child can be either a boy or a girl, and there are six children, which results in 2^6 = 64 combinations).

If we know that 45 families resulted in the order G B G B B G, we can set up a proportion to estimate the number of families with any other specific birth order, given the same probability for each birth order.

Let n represent the total number of families surveyed. The proportion of families showing the sequence G B G B B G is 45/n. Setting this proportion to the probability calculated for any specific sequence (1/64), we have:

45 / n = 1 / 64 

Solving for n (the total number of families surveyed):
n = 45 * 64 = 2880.

Now, knowing that there are 2880 families, and each specific sequence (e.g., B G B B B B) also has the same probability of occurring (1/64), we estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B will be:

(1/64) * 2880 = 45.

Thus, the estimated number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is also:

{answer: 45}
