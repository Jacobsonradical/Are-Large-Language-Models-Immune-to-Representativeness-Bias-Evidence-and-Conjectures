To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the concept of binomial probability, as the birth of a boy or a girl is typically seen as a binary and independent outcome.

Given that in 45 families, the exact sequence was G B G B B G, we start by noting that each child being born a boy or a girl is presumably a 50% chance (assuming the probability of a boy or a girl being born is equal and that births are independent events).

The probability \( P \) of any specific sequence of 6 children, where order matters and each event (birth of a boy or a girl) is independent and equally likely (p = 0.5 for a boy, 0.5 for a girl), is calculated as:
\[ P = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \]
This probability reflects the likelihood of having any specific arrangement of 6 children, such as B G B B B B or G B G B B G.

Given that the city has X families with exactly six children, and considering that 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, and assuming each sequence of six children is equally likely:
\[ X \times 0.015625 = 45 \]
\[ X = \frac{45}{0.015625} \]
\[ X = 2880 \]

Thus, there are an estimated 2880 families in the city with exactly six children. 

For the sequence B G B B B B:
Using the same logic, the number of families that might have the sequence B G B B B B will also be:
\[ 2880 \times 0.015625 = 45 \]

Therefore,
{answer: 45}
