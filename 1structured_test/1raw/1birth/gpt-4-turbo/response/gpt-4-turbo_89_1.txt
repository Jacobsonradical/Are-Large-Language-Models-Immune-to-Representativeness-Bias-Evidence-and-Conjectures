To estimate the number of families with the birth order BGBBBB based on the provided data of 45 families with the birth order GBGBBG, we use probability reasoning assuming each child being a boy or a girl is equally likely.

Each specific sequence of 6 children, such as GBGBBG or BGBBBB, has a probability of:
\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]
This probability means that in any family of six children, the chance of having any specific given sequence of boys and girls is 1 in 64, assuming the probability of a child being a boy or girl is exactly 50%.

Thus, if there are \(N\) families with six children in the city, the expected number of families with any specific birth order is given by
\[ E = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]

We know from data given:
\[ 45 = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]
This estimates the total number of families of six children in the city.

Using this total number of families, to find the expected number with the birth order BGBBBB:
\[ E_{\text{BGBBBB}} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Thus, the estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was BGBBBB is:
{answer: 45}
