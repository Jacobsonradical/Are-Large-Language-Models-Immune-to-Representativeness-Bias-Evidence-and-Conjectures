To solve the problem, let's assume that the probability of a child being born a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., probability of each is 0.5, assuming that gender births are independent events). We also assume that the births in these families are similarly independent events.

For the first sequence given (G B G B B G):
- The probability of any specific child being a boy or a girl is 1/2.
- Thus, the probability of having a sequence of G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

We know that 45 families had this specific sequence. Given that the probability of this sequence occurring is 1/64, the total number of families surveyed, N, can be estimated by:
\[ N \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

For the sequence B G B B B B, the probability is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64 (since there are exactly six children, and each child being a boy or a girl is an independent event with a probability of 1/2). 

Therefore, we can expect similarly that the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B among the 2880 families surveyed is:
\[ 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Hence, {answer: 45}.
