To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B based on the data provided for the sequence G B G B B G, we will use the assumption that the probability of having a boy or a girl is independent of the birth order and is the same (thus each is 1/2).

Let's denote p as the probability of having a boy or girl at each birth. Since the genders are presumably equally likely,

p = 1/2 for a boy, and p = 1/2 for a girl.

We're dealing with sequences of six children (births) where each sequence has a specific order. The probability P of any specific sequence of genders where there are k boys and (6-k) girls is given by:
\[ P = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}.\]

This probability applies to any specific order of six children whether it's G B G B B G or B G B B B B or any other combination.

The given information is that there were 45 families with the exact birth order of G B G B B G, and we want to estimate how many had the sequence B G B B B B:

Given that the probability for any specific sequence is the same and that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, itâ€™s reasonable to estimate that the number of families with any other specific sequence, such as B G B B B B, would also be 45.

Thus, the estimate for the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
{answer: 45}
