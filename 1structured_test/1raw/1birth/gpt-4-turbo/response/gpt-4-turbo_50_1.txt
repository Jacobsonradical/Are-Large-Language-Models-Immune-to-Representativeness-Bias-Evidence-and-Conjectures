To estimate the number of families surveyed where the order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the assumption of equal likelihood of each possible sequence of six children being boys (B) or girls (G), considering boys and girls are equally likely for each birth.

We know that each child being born as a boy (B) or a girl (G) is an independent event with a probability of 1/2 for each. The probability (P) of any specific order of six children can be calculated as:
\[ P = (\frac{1}{2})^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

This probability holds for any specific order, including the orders G B G B B G and B G B B B B.

Given that 45 families had the children in the order of G B G B B G:
\[ Number\,of\,families\,(Total) \times Probability\,(Order = G B G B B G) = 45 \]
\[ Total = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, we estimate the number of families where the order of births was B G B B B B:
\[ Number\,of\,families\,(Total) \times Probability\,(Order = B G B B B B) = Estimate \]
\[ 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate for the order B G B B B B is:
{answer: 45}
