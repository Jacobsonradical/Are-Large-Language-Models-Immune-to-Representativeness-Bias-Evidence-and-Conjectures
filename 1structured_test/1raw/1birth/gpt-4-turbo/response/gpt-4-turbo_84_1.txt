To estimate the number of families with an exact order of births of B G B B B B, we can start by analyzing general information about probabilities and assuming equal likelihood of boys and girls at each birth (probability \( p = 0.5 \) for either gender).

Given the order of births in the problem (G B G B B G) resulted in 45 families having that sequence, we will assume that the probability for any specific sequence of 6 children (3 boys and 3 girls or other distributions of genders) is the same if the number of boys and girls in the sequence is the same.

For the sequence G B G B B G, there are 3 boys and 3 girls. To find the probability of this sequence under the assumption of equal likelihood of boys and girls and independent births:
- The count of unique arrangements of 3 boys (B) and 3 girls (G) is calculated by \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \). 

For the sequence B G B B B B, there are 1 girl and 5 boys. The count of unique arrangements of this sequence is:
- \( \binom{6}{1} = 6 \).

If each distinguishable sequence has the same probability of occurrence, then the number of families displaying the same sequence should be proportional to the number of such sequences. 

Given 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, and the fact that there are 20 possible arrangements for 3 boys and 3 girls among any families having three boys and three girls, it is reasonable to expect that families will occur in proportional amounts to the binomial choices. Families with 1 girl and 5 boys will have 6 possible arrangements among them. We can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B proportional to its occurrence:

If \( \frac{45}{20} \) families is the rate for one arrangement of 3 girls and 3 boys, for one arrangement of 1 girl and 5 boys, the expected number of families is:
\[ \frac{45}{20} \times 6 \approx 13.5 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with birth sequence B G B B B B is around:
