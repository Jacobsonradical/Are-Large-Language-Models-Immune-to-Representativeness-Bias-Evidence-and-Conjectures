To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can utilize the probability of such an order occurring under the assumption that each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl with probability 1/2.

For the observed sequence G B G B B G, the number of girls (G) and boys (B) is equal (3 girls and 3 boys). The probability of any specific order of 3 girls and 3 boys among 6 children is given by \( P = \frac{6!}{3!3!} \cdot (1/2)^6 = 20 \cdot (1/2)^6 = 20 \cdot 1/64 = \frac{20}{64} = \frac{5}{16} \).

However, since we know there were 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, this indicates that the calculation above is incorrect for our specific scenario due to possibly differing probabilities, non-independence, or other variations among births in the city. Instead, let's find the probability of our desired sequence B G B B B B under equal-gender assumption.

This second sequence (B G B B B B) has 5 boys and 1 girl. The number of ways to arrange 5 boys and 1 girl is given by \( \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6 \). The probability of such an arrangement with 5 boys (B) and 1 girl (G) is \( 6 \cdot (1/2)^6 = 6 \cdot 1/64 = \frac{6}{64} = \frac{3}{32} \).

Given the complexities and potential inaccuracies in the underlying assumptions, if the order G B G B B G had 45 families, we can use an analogous proportional estimation for the order B G B B B B. We calculated earlier the expected probability for each sequence, but those probabilities do not seem to be reflective in this specific population based on the given data. If both were guided purely by chance, under equal likelihood of birth sequences:

- Probability sequence of G B G B B G in a survey: \(\frac{5}{16}\)
- Probability sequence of B G B B B B in a survey: \(\frac{3}{32}\) 

The ratio of the probabilities of these sequences is \(\frac{3/32}{5/16} = \frac{3 \cdot 16}{5 \cdot 32} = \frac{48}{160} = 0.3\).

Thus, if 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, I would estimate that:
\(0.3 \times 45 = 13.5\), approximately 14 families would have the sequence B G B B B B.
