To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use a probabilistic approach. Consider equally likely sequences of 6 births, where each birth can be a boy (B) or a girl (G). 

Each child being a boy or a girl is an independent event. If we assume the probability of each child being a boy or a girl is 0.5 (a common assumption in the absence of other data), then each of the \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six children is equally likely.

The sequences GBBBBG and BGBBBB are both specific sequences of 6 births. The probability of any specific sequence occurring is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}\).

Since there are 45 families in which the order was GBBBBG, we estimate that there are also about 45 similar sequences of the other type, as both are just as likely:
