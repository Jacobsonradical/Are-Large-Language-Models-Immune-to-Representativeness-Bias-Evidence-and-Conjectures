To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we first recognize that each birth event of a boy (B) or a girl (G) is an independent event with a probability of 0.5 for each gender, assuming there is an equal chance of having a boy or a girl.

Given that the order G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we first need to determine the probability of this specific sequence occurring:

The probability \( P \) of any specific sequence of six children in which there are a certain number of boys and girls equals \( 0.5^6 \) because each child can independently be a boy or a girl with equal probability. Since there are six children, and each child has two possibilities (boy or girl), the expression \( 0.5^6 \) accounts for all the different combinations where this particular order can happen:

\[ P = 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = \frac{1}{64} \]

The sequence G B G B B G was observed in 45 families, hence the number of families that exhibit any specific sequence of three boys and three girls would be expected to be the same under the assumption of equal probability for all such sequences.

Since the sequence B G B B B B also consists of three boys and three girls, the probability of this sequence occurring is also \( \frac{1}{64} \). Assuming the total number of families remains consistent across different specific sequences, we can reasonably estimate that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is also 45, since any order of three boys and three girls should be statistically as probable as G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
