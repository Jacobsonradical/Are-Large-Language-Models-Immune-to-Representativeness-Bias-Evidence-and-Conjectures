To estimate the number of families surveyed where the birth order was B G B B B B, we can use information from the order given, G B G B B G, which occurred in 45 families. This can help us estimate the likelihood of any specific gender sequence appearing in this sample of six-child families.

When thinking about the birth orders, we'll assume that the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equal (0.5 for each) and independent of other births. 

The probability \( P \) of any specific sequence of births where there are three boys and three girls (like in G B G B B G) is calculated as:
\[ P = \frac{6!}{3!3!} (0.5)^6 = 20 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{20}{64} = \frac{5}{16} \]

However, the sequence B G B B B B involves five boys and one girl. The probability \( Q \) of this sequence happening is:
\[ Q = \frac{6!}{5!1!} (0.5)^6 = 6 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{6}{64} = \frac{3}{32} \]

We can estimate the ratio between families having the sequence B G B B B B and the sequence G B G B B G using the ratio of their probabilities:
\[ \frac{Q}{P} = \frac{\frac{3}{32}}{\frac{5}{16}} = \frac{3}{32} \times \frac{16}{5} = \frac{48}{160} = \frac{3}{10} \]

Since the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, the number of families where the sequence B G B B B B occurred can be estimated by:
\[ \text{Estimated families for B G B B B B} = 45 \times \frac{3}{10} = 13.5 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, our estimate would be:
