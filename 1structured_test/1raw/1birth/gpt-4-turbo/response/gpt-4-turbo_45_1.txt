To solve this problem, we'll first recognize that the scenario described is one of binomial probability, where each birth is assumed to be independent of others, and the birth of a boy and a girl are equally likely. The probability \( p \) of either a boy or a girl being born is therefore 0.5.

Let's compute the probability for each specific sequence of births (6 children) where the probability of either boy or girl (denoted by B and G) in each birth is 0.5.

1. For the sequence G B G B B G in 45 families:
   - Probability \( P \) = \( (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \)

Given that this sequence happened in 45 families, we estimate the total number of six-child families surveyed by considering \( n \) families with the probability of exactly this sequence:
   - \( 45 = n \times 0.015625 \)
   - \( n = 45 / 0.015625 = 2880 \)

Now, we apply this total estimate to find the number expected for the sequence B G B B B B.

2. Probability of sequence B G B B B B:
   - Probability \( P \) = \( (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \) (same calculation, different arrangement)

Given the total estimated number of families:
   - Number of families with sequence B G B B B B is approximately \( 2880 \times 0.015625 \)

Calculate that:
   - \( 2880 \times 0.015625 = 45 \)

Thus, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is 45.
