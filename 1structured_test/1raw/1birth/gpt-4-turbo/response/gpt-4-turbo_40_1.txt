To estimate the number of families that had children in the order BGBBBB, we first must understand the context given â€“ that 45 families had children in the order GBGBBG.

In families with six children, the probability of each particular configuration (sequence of boys and girls) occurring is the same, given that each child, irrespective of the previous children, can independently be a boy or a girl with probability 1/2 (assuming equal probability of having a boy or a girl). This probability is \( (1/2)^6 = 1/64 \), since there are 6 children and each can be a boy or a girl.

Given that there are 2^6 = 64 possible sequences in which 6 children can be born as boys or girls, and the probability of any specific sequence occurring is equal, each specific sequence such as GBGBBG or BGBBBB occurs with the same probability.

Hence, if 45 families reported the sequence GBGBBG, we would expect roughly the same number of families to report any other specific sequence, such as BGBBBB, because each sequence is equally likely.

Thus,
{answer: 45}
