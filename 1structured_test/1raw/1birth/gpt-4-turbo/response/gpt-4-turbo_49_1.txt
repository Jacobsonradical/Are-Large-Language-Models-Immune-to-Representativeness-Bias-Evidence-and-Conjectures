To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the probability model assuming that the genders of the children in each birth are independent and that the probability of giving birth to a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equal (1/2 for each), and apply it to the data from the survey about the 45 families where the order was G B G B B G.

First, let's calculate the probability of any specific sequence of 6 births resulting in either B or G. Each child being born a boy or a girl is an independent event with a probability of 1/2. Since there are 6 children, the probability of any specific sequence (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) occurring is:
\[ (1/2)^6 = 1/64. \]

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (N). Since there are 64 possible sequences of 6 children, and each sequence has the probability of 1/64, the expected number of families with any specific sequence is \(N/64\).

If we set \(N/64 = 45\) for the sequence G B G B B G, solving for N gives:
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880. \]

Now, to estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B:
Since each sequence is equally probable, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should also equal \(N/64 = 45\).

Thus, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.
