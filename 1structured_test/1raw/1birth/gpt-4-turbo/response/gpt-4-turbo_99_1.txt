To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we first consider the probability associated with any specific sequence of 6 births (boys or girls). Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (1/2 for each), and that the gender of a newborn is independent of the others, we can establish the formula for the likelihood of any particular sequence.

The likelihood \( P \) of any specified sequence of 3 boys and 3 girls (as in G B G B B G), or any sequence of 1 girl and 5 boys (as in B G B B B B) is calculated as:
\[ P = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 \]
This translates, for both sequences, to:
\[ P = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that there are 45 families where the sequence G B G B B G occurred, this suggests:
\[ 45 = T \times \frac{1}{64} \]
where \( T \) is the total number of families surveyed. 

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]
This indicates there were 2,880 families surveyed.

Now, applying this to the sequence B G B B B B, which is another specific sequence also having a probability of \( \frac{1}{64} \) of occurring:
\[ \text{Expected number of families with B G B B B B sequence} = T \times \frac{1}{64} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 45 \]

Thus, we estimate that there are 45 families where the sequence B G B B B B occurred, same as the number of families where G B G B B G occurred, given that both sequences are equally likely.
