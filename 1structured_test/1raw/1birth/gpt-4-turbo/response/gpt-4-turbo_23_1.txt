To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can assume that the probability of a child being a boy or a girl is roughly equal (50% each for simplicity, assuming a binomial distribution), and these events are independent of each other.

For any specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B), the probability of that exact sequence occurring is:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Given that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that:

\[
\text{Total number of sequences (n)} \times \frac{1}{64} = 45
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
n = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

This suggests that there were about 2880 families surveyed in total. Now, since the probability of any specific sequence occurring is the same, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is also:

\[
\frac{2880}{64} = 45
\]

Therefore, it is estimated that 45 families had the sequence B G B B B B, same as any specific sequence among families of six children assuming uniform probabilities for boy and girl births.
