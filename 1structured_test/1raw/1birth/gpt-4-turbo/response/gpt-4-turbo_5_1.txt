To solve this problem, it's useful to recall that the probability of each sequence of boy (B) and girl (G) births in a family with six children assuming that the probability of a child being a boy or a girl is independent of the others, and that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (each being 0.5), depends only on the number of boys and girls in the sequence, not the specific order. 

Given:
1. There are 45 families where the exact order was G B G B B G.
2. This sequence consists of 3 girls and 3 boys.
   
The sequence B G B B B B also consists of 1 girl and 5 boys.

The number of ways to arrange 3 girls and 3 boys (G B G B B G) is \({6 \choose 3}\) = 20.
And the number of ways to arrange 1 girl and 5 boys (B G B B B B) is \({6 \choose 1}\) = 6.

Since both calculations concern situations with the same number of children and each child being independently a boy or girl with probability 0.5, the probability of any specific arrangement of 3 boys and 3 girls is equal to the probability of any specific arrangement of 1 girl and 5 boys. 

Therefore, given that we observed 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G (out of all possible arrangements of 3 boys and 3 girls), the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B (out of all possible arrangements of 1 girl and 5 boys) can be calculated as follows:
- \(\frac{6}{20} \times 45\) families, because there are fewer ways (6) to arrange one sequence (B G B B B B) compared to the other (20 ways), and we assume randomness and equal likelihood of boy or girl at each birth.

\[ \frac{6}{20} \times 45 = \frac{6}{20} \times 45 = 13.5 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, since you cannot have a fraction of a family:
