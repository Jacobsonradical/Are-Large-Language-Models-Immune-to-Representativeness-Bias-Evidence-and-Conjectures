To estimate the number of families surveyed where the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use probability and the information given about the configuration G B G B B G.

1. The probability of any specific sequence of 6 children (boys (B) and girls (G)) assuming the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (1/2 each) is:
   - \( P(sequence) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64 \)

2. The order of G B G B B G was observed in 45 families. Since each of the \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences was equally likely, and there are 64 different sequences, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (N) by assuming the average occurrence of each sequence is similar in a large enough sample. Thus, the expected frequency of any sequence (F) is:
   - \( F = N \times (1/64) \)
   - Given \( 45 = N \times (1/64) \) for the sequence G B G B B G, we solve for N:
   - \( N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \)

3. Now, to find the estimated number of families with the birth sequence B G B B B B:
   - Since the probability of any given sequence is 1/64, and we estimate there are 2880 families:
   - \( \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = 2880 \times (1/64) = 45 \)

So, the estimate number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.
