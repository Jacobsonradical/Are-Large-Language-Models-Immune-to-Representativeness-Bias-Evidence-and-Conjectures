To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was BGBBBB, we can utilize a probabilistic approach based on the information given for the sequence G B G B B G. We begin by assuming each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, independent of other births, which is \( p(B) = p(G) = \frac{1}{2} \).

The sequence G B G B B G, where there are three boys (B) and three girls (G), was observed in 45 families.

The probability \( P \) of any specific sequence of 3 boys and 3 girls in 6 children is given by:
\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]
This is because each child being a boy or a girl is independent, and the probability of any child being a boy or a girl is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Since there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) different ways to arrange 3 boys and 3 girls in a sequence of 6 children, the probability that a randomly chosen arrangement of 6 children has exactly 3 boys and 3 girls is:
\[ P(3 \text{ boys, 3 girls}) = 20 \cdot \frac{1}{64} = \frac{20}{64} = \frac{5}{16} \]

Let \( n \) be the total number of families surveyed. Assuming a homogeneous probability of any specific gender sequence, the expected number of families observing the sequence G B G B B G is:
\[ \frac{n \cdot 1}{64} = 45 \]
Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[ n = 45 \cdot 64 = 2880 \]

Now we need to estimate the number of families where the sequence is B G B B B B. The probability of getting this specific sequence is also:
\[ P(B G B B B B) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

So the estimated number of surveyed families with the sequence B G B B B B is:
\[ n \cdot \frac{1}{64} = 2880 \cdot \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families where the pattern of births was B G B B B B is:
