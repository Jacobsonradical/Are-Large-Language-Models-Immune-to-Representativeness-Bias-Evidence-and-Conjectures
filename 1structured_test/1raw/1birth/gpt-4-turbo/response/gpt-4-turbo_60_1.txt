To answer this question, we start by understanding that the order of children as boys (B) and girls (G) for each family of six children can be treated as a sequence of Bernoulli trials (each child being a boy or a girl). Assuming the probability of each gender is \( p \) for a boy and \( 1-p \) for a girl, each specific order of six children has a probability of \( p^k (1-p)^{6-k} \), where \( k \) is the number of boys.

In the given order G B G B B G (which is 3 boys and 3 girls), the probability is:
\[ (1-p)^3 \times p^3 \]

In the order B G B B B B (which is 5 boys and 1 girl), the probability is:
\[ p^5 \times (1-p)^1 \]

Given that these birth orders are equally likely aside from these probability weightings, we need to find the relative probabilities of these two sequences occurring, and then use that ratio to estimate the number of families with the second sequence, given the number of families with the first sequence.

The probability ratio \( R \) between the second and first sequence is:
\[ R = \frac{p^5 \times (1 - p)}{(1-p)^3 \times p^3} = \frac{p^2}{(1-p)^2} \]

Without specific information on \( p \), we might assume \( p = 0.5 \) (equal probability of boy or girl). In this case:
\[ R = \frac{(0.5)^2}{(0.5)^2} = 1 \]

Thus, if the ratios are equal, we could expect equivalent counts of families for these two orders given identical probabilities. However, we should note that we are simplifying here, especially by assuming \( p = 0.5 \). Depending on real world demographics, \( p \) might be slightly different. 

Given the relative probability ratio \( R \) and knowing there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B under the assumption of equal likelihood (based on our ratio calculation) would be:
\[ 45 \times R \]

Under the assumed \( p = 0.5 \), since \( R = 1 \):
\[ 45 \times 1 = 45 \]

Therefore, my estimate would be:
