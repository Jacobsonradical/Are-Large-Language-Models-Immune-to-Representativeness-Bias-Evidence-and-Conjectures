To find an estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the fact that each unique sequence of 6 gender assignments (where order matters and each child has two possible outcomes, boy or girl) is as likely as any other.

Given:
- Probability of boy = Probability of girl = 0.5 for each child
- Each arrangement has \( (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \) probability of occurring

If 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, which is one specific sequence out of all possible sequences, we presume this is approximately representative of the number of families that would show any particular sequence.

There are \( 2^6 = 64 \) different possible sequences of 6 children.

If each sequence of birth outcomes is equally likely (assuming equal probability of having a boy or a girl for each birth), the number of families that had the birth order B G B B B B should be comparable to those who had G B G B B G.

Therefore:
{answer: 45}
