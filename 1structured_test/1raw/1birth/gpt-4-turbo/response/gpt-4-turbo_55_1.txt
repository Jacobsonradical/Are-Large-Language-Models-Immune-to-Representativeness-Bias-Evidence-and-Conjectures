To solve this problem, we make use of the assumption that the gender of each child is independent of the others, and that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for a boy and 0.5 for a girl).

Given:
- For n families, there were 45 instances where the birth order was G B G B B G.

To find the estimation:
1. Calculate the probability of the sequence G B G B B G happening. Since each child being a boy or a girl is independent and with equal probability:
\[ P(G B G B B G) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \]
2. This probability shows that the expected number of families to have this order out of all surveyed families \( N \) is given by \( 0.015625 \times N \). Given 45 such families were observed:
\[ 0.015625 \times N = 45 \]
\[ N = \frac{45}{0.015625} = 2880 \]
The total number of families surveyed is estimated to be 2880.

Now to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B:
1. Calculate the probability of the sequence B G B B B B happening:
\[ P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 \]
2. Using the total estimated number of families \( N = 2880 \):
\[ 0.015625 \times 2880 = 45 \]

Therefore, our estimation for the number of families surveyed where the birth order was B G B B B B is 45.

{answer: 45}
