To find an estimate for the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we first understand the probability of any specific sequence occurring when each child has an independent 50% chance of being a boy (B) or a girl (G).

The probability \( P \) of any specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) where each position in the sequence might be either B or G, with probabilities of each being \( \frac{1}{2} \), is calculated as:

\[
P = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Given that 45 families have the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families \( N \) surveyed using this probability. If 45 families represent the outcomes of one specific sequence from a sample, then the total number of families surveyed can be estimated by setting up the equation:

\[
\frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Solving for \( N \):

\[
N = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

Now, estimating the number of families with the order B G B B B B (another specific sequence of 6 children):

\[
\text{Number of families with B G B B B B sequence} = N \times \frac{1}{64} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45
\]

Thus, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.
