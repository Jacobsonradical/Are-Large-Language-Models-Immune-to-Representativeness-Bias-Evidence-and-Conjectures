To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probabilities involved given the information we have. The scenario suggests that specific orderings of boys and girls are equally likely.

In the given information, the order G B G B B G has occurred in 45 families out of all sequences surveyed. Each sequence of six children either being a boy or a girl can be thought of following a binomial distribution. Each sequence of distinct orders (any specific arrangement of boys and girls like G B G B B G or B G B B B B, etc.) has 2^6 = 64 possible outcomes, and each specific arrangement has the same probability under the assumption of equally likely sexes at birth.

Given the likelihood of each arrangement (assuming no preference or influence on gender), the frequency of observing any particular sequence depends mainly on the number of surveyed families. Since G B G B B G occurred 45 times, we could reasonably expect a similarly probable sequence like B G B B B B to have occurred a comparable number of times assuming the overall binomial distribution remains relatively balanced and the independence of gender per child (i.e., no skew towards more boys or girls). Therefore, an estimate for the sequence B G B B B B would similarly be 45.

Hence, the estimate would be: {answer: 45}
