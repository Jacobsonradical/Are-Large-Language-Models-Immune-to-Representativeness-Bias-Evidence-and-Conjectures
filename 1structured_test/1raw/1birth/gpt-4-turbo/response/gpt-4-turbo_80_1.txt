To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we will follow the principles of probability with some assumptions.

### Assumptions
1. Each child has an equal probability of being a boy (B) or a girl (G) = 0.5.
2. Each birth is independent of the others.

### Calculations
1. **Probability Calculation for Pattern G B G B B G:**
   - The probability of having the children in the order G B G B B G is:
     \[
     P(\text{G B G B B G}) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625
     \]
   
2. **Probability Calculation for Pattern B G B B B B:**
   - The probability of having the children in the order B G B B B B is:
     \[
     P(\text{B G B B B B}) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625
     \]

3. **Expected Counts:**
   - If the probability for any specific sequence of six children being G B G B B G is \(0.015625\), and 45 families were observed with this sequence, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by equating this to the expected number of such families:

     \[
     \text{Expected number of families with G B G B B G} = N \cdot 0.015625
     \]
     
     where \(N\) is the total number of families surveyed, and we know 
     \[
     N \cdot 0.015625 = 45 \implies N = \frac{45}{0.015625}
     \]
   
4. **Estimate Total Families and Other Sequences:**
   - Solving:
     \[
     N = \frac{45}{0.015625} = 2880
     \]
   - Since the probability for B G B B B B is the same as for G B G B B G, the expected number of families with the B G B B B B sequence is:
     \[
     \text{Expected number of B G B B B B} = 2880 \cdot 0.015625 = 45
     \]

### Conclusion
Given the assumptions and the calculations, there would also be 45 families in which the birth order was B G B B B B.
