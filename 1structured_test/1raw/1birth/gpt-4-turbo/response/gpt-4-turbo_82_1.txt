To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can make use of the assumption that each child born has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, which is \(1/2\) for each gender.

First, we calculate the probability of getting any specific order of genders in six children. Each specific sequence of sexes has a probability of:
\[
P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]
This is because each child being a boy or a girl is an independent event with a probability of \(1/2\), and there are six children.

Since 45 families have the specific birth order G B G B B G, we can calculate the total number of families by assuming the proportion of this specific order reflects the probability \(1/64\):

\[
\text{Total Families} = \frac{\text{Number of families with G B G B B G}}{P(\text{G B G B B G})} = \frac{45}{1/64} = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

Now, to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we use the same probability of \(1/64\) for any specific birth order, including B G B B B B. Thus, the estimated number of such families is:

\[
\text{Estimated Families with B G B B B B} = \text{Total Families} \times P(\text{B G B B B B}) = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
