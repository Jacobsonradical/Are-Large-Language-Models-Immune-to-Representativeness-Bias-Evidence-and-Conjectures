To solve this problem, we assume that the likelihood of having a boy or a girl is equal (probability of 0.5 each) and that each birth is independent of others. We can use this information to calculate the probability of any specific sequence of six births occurring.

First, let's find the probability of the sequence G B G B B G occurring:
P(G B G B B G) = P(G) * P(B) * P(G) * P(B) * P(B) * P(G) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Since 45 families have the exact order G B G B B G, and assuming that every sequence is equally likely due to random chance, we can now find the total number of families surveyed. If the probability of this sequence occurring is 0.015625 and 45 families have this sequence, we can calculate the total number of families (N) surveyed as follows:
0.015625 * N = 45
N = 45 / 0.015625 = 2880.

Now, we'll find the probability of the sequence B G B B B B:
P(B G B B B B) = P(B) * P(G) * P(B) * P(B) * P(B) * P(B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Given that both sequences have the same probability of occurring, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B based on the total number of families:
(0.015625) * 2880 = 45 families.

This is the number of families we estimate to have that exact sequence of births.
