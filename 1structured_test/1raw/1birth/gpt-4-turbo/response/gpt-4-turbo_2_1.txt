To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B given the number surveyed with the birth order G B G B B G, we must consider the likelihood of each specific order occurring under the assumption that each child born has an equal probability (1/2) of being a boy or a girl, and that each birth event is independent of the others.

Both sequences G B G B B G and B G B B B B have exactly three boys and three girls. The total number of possible arrangements for any sequence with exactly three boys and three girls among six children can be calculated using the binomial coefficient, \( \binom{n}{k} \), which counts the number of ways to choose k successes (boys, in this case) in n trials (total number of children). 

Thus, the number of ways to arrange three boys and three girls is:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3! \cdot (6-3)!} = \frac{720}{6 \cdot 6} = 20 \]

Each specific sequence (G B G B B G and B G B B B B) is just one of these 20 equally likely arrangements. Therefore, if we have 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and assuming the distribution of family structures is uniform across all possible arrangements of three boys and three girls, we can use proportionality to estimate the number of families with any other specific sequence. 

Since each sequence is equally likely, the expected number of families for any particular sequence of three boys and three girls (like B G B B B B) should be the same as the observed number for G B G B B G. 

So, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 45, the same as for G B G B B G.
