To estimate the number of families with the specific birth order B G B B B B, we first approach the problem assuming the probability of a child being born a boy (B) or a girl (G) is the same, i.e., the probability p(B) = p(G) = 0.5. This is a typical assumption unless given demographic or genetic evidence to the contrary.

The order given in the question, G B G B B G, consists of three boys and three girls. The probability of any specific sequence of three boys and three girls (like G B G B B G) happening can be calculated using the binomial coefficient, which counts the number of ways to arrange k successes (boys, in this case) in n trials (total births), each with probability p. The formula for finding the number of ways to arrange three boys among six children is given by the binomial coefficient C(6,3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!) = 20. The probability of any specific arrangement with three boys and three girls is (1/2)^6 (because each child independently has a 1/2 chance of being a boy or a girl), so the probability of a specific sequence like G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Since we know 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we first calculate the expected number of families that should have that sequence out of the total surveyed, given it's one of the 20 equally likely sequences of three boys and three girls:

Let n be the total number of families surveyed. The expected number of families with any specific sequence is n/64 because there are 64 possible sequences of boys and girls (2^6), and each is equally likely under our assumption of p(B) = p(G) = 0.5. 

If 45 families represent n/64 families for the sequence G B G B B G, then n = 45 × 64.

Now, consider the specific sequence B G B B B B, which has one girl and five boys. There's only one way this particular sequence can occur, so the probability of this sequence occurring is similarly (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Thus, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B among the surveyed families is:
Number of such families = Total families surveyed × Probability of one such family = (45 × 64) × (1/64) = 45.

Therefore, the estimate is:
