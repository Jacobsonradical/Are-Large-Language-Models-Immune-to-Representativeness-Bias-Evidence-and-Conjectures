To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was BGBBBB, we can assume that the likelihood of the birth of a boy or a girl is roughly equal (and thus each has a probability of 1/2), and that the sex of each child is independent of the others.

The orders GBGBBG and BGBBBB each have exactly four boys and two girls. The probability of any specific sequence of six children with four boys and two girls is given by:

\[ P(\text{specific sequence of 4 boys and 2 girls}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

There are \(\binom{6}{4}\) (or \(\binom{6}{2}\)) different sequences in which exactly four children are boys and two are girls:

\[ \binom{6}{4} = \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 \]

Each of the 15 sequences of four boys and two girls is equally likely (each occurring with a probability of 1/64). The given data point from the survey is that 45 families had the sequence GBGBBG, which is one specific sequence out of these 15 possible sequences.

The ratio of \(\frac{45}{1}\) represents the number of families observed per specific sequence of two girls and four boys. Assuming the same ratio applies to all sequences of four boys and two girls, the estimate for the number of families where the birth order was BGBBBB is similarly:

\[ 45 \text{ families} \]

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

{answer: 45}
