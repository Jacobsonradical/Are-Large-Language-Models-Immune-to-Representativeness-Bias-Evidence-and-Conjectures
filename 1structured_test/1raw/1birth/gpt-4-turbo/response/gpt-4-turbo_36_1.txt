To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use a probability-based approach and information given about a similar event.

1. Calculating Probability:
   Each child being born has a 50% chance of being a girl (G) or a boy (B), assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal and independent of previous births.

2. Probability of a Specific Sequence:
   For the sequence G B G B B G:
   \( P(G B G B B G) = (\frac{1}{2})^6 = \frac{1}{64} \)
   
   The same calculation applies to any specific sequence of six children, including B G B B B B:
   \( P(B G B B B B) = (\frac{1}{2})^6 = \frac{1}{64} \)

3. Using the Known Data:
   We know that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G.
   Since the probability of obtaining any specific sequence (such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is the same (\(\frac{1}{64}\)), we can estimate that the number of families for any specific sequence of births will be similar in a large enough sample.

4. Estimating the Number:
   Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, it would be reasonable, due to equal probability, to expect a similar number of families, 45, to have the sequence B G B B B B.

Thus, the estimate:
