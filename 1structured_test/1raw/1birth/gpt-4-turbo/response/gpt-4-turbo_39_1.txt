To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was BGBBBB, we can use the information given about the similarly structured scenario where the order of births was GBGBBG in 45 families.

Let's assume the probability of each child being a boy (B) or a girl (G) is independent and equally likely (probability of 1/2 for each). The number of families where the birth order is GBGBBG can be given by:

\[ P(\text{GBGBBG}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

If the order GBGBBG occurred in 45 families, to scale this up to account for all the families surveyed, we use:

\[ \text{Total families surveyed} = \frac{45}{\frac{1}{64}} = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, to find the number of families with the birth order of BGBBBB, we again calculate the probability of this specific order:

\[ P(\text{BGBBBB}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Since the probability is the same for both patterns GBGBBG and BGBBBB, they will occur with the same frequency aboard the total families surveyed. Therefore, the number of families with birth order BGBBBB is also:

\[ \text{Number of families with BGBBBB} = \text{Total families} \times P(\text{BGBBBB}) = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

{answer: 45}
