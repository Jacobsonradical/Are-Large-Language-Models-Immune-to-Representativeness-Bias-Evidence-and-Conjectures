To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was BGBBBB, we first look at the probabilities of these specific birth orders under the assumption that the likelihood of boy or girl births in each position is equal (50% probability for either).

For the order G B G B B G, which occurred in 45 families, the probability of this exact sequence occurring (assuming independence of each birth's outcome) is:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Since we know 45 families had this arrangement, we can estimate the total number of families \( N \) surveyed from this data. If the surveyed result 45 corresponds to the probability outcome \( \frac{1}{64} \times N \):

\[
\frac{1}{64} N = 45
\]
\[
N = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

The total number of families surveyed is thus estimated to be 2880.

Now, we examine the birth order B G B B B B. Under similar assumptions of equal probability for boys and girls (50%), the likelihood of this sequence occurring is also:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Thus, the expected number of families with the B G B B B B sequence is:

\[
\frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45
\]

Therefore, based on the probabilities and the information provided, our estimate for the number of families with the B G B B B B birth order is the same as for the G B G B B G order given equal probabilities for each distinct sequence.
