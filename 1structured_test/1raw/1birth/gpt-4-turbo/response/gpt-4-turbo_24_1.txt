To estimate the number of families surveyed where the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information given for the order G B G B B G and basic probability principles. 

Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely (i.e., the probability for each is 0.5), each specific sequence of six children (e.g., BBBBGB or GBGBBG) is equally probable. There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of 6 children where each child can either be a boy (B) or a girl (G).

Since we know that in 45 families, the birth order was G B G B B G (one specific sequence), and assuming that the probability of each sequence is the same, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed. Since one sequence represents \(\frac{1}{64}\) of all possible sequences, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{64} \times \text{Total Number of Families} = 45
\]
Solving for the Total Number of Families:
\[
\text{Total Number of Families} = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]
Therefore, we estimate that the total number of families surveyed was 2880.

For the specific sequence B G B B B B, being one out of the 64 possible sequences, the estimated number of families with this birth sequence would be:
\[
\frac{2880}{64} = 45
\]
Hence, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is about 45.
