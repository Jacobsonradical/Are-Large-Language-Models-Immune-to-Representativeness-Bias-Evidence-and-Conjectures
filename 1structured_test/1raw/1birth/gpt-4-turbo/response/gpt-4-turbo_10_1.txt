To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use probabilities on the assumption that each child being born a boy or a girl is an independent event and that boys and girls are equally likely (each with probability 0.5).

If we consider the surveyed outcomes G B G B B G (the observed case) and B G B B B B (the case we need to estimate), each of these sequences has 6 children and so involves 6 independent birth events. The probability of any specific sequence of 6 births occurring under our assumptions (where each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl) is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

The number of families where the sequence G B G B B G occurs is 45. Given that the probability of any specific sequence occurring is uniformly 1/64, we can find the total number of families surveyed, denoted as N, by equating the known outcomes:
\[ 45 = N \times (1/64) \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, we want the estimate of the number of families where the exact sequence is B G B B B B. As stated, each sequence is equally likely, so we expect the occurrence of B G B B B B to be estimated similarly:
\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = 2880 \times (1/64) = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families where the sequence of births is B G B B B B is
