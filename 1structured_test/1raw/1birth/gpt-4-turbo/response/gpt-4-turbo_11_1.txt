To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the birth order of children was B G B B B B, we can approach this problem by first understanding the probabilities involved in having different birth orders under the assumption of equal likelihood of a child being a boy or a girl for each birth, and independence between births.

Let's define the birth orders:
- Pattern A (G B G B B G)
- Pattern B (B G B B B B)

In both patterns, we have 6 children per family. Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl in each birth is equal (1/2 for a boy and 1/2 for a girl), we want to find the probability of any specific pattern occurring in 6 births, and then estimate the corresponding count of families with another specific pattern using the count given for the first pattern.

1. **Calculating Probabilities:**
   Each child being born can either be a boy (B) or a girl (G). The probability \(P\) of any specific order (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) happening in a particular family is \( (1/2)^6 \) or \(1/64\) since gender preference for each child is independent.

2. **Estimating the Proportion of Occurrences:**
   Since the probabilities are the same for any specific sequence of 6 children (as long as the number of boys and girls is the same in each sequence), the number of families in which other sequences occur should be proportional.

3. **Given Data and Proportional Estimation:**
   We know 45 families had the order G B G B B G. Since the probability of any specific sequence of 4 boys and 2 girls occurring is the same, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B would also be \(45\) under these assumptions (although not necessarily exactly in reality, due to variance and non-random factors affecting child gender).

Therefore:
{answer: 45}
