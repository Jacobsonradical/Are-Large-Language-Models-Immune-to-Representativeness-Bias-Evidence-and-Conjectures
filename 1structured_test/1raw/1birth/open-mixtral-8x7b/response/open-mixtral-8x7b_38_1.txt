{answer: The number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B would be statistically similar to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, so a reasonable estimate would be 45 families.}

Here's the reasoning:

1. This problem doesn't seem to lend itself to an exact solution, as it would require knowledge of the total number of families surveyed and the number of families having a specific gender composition (e.g., two boys and four girls, three boys and three girls, etc.).
2. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the information provided. If the sequence G B G B B G is observed in 45 families, it suggests that the gender of the child is more or less randomly determined in each birth.
3. Therefore, we would expect to see a similar number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, as this sequence is equally likely given random gender determination.
4. Note that this is a statistical estimate and might not reflect the exact number due to chance variations or small sample sizes.
