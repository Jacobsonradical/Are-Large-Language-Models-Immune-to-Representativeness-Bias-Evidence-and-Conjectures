{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is 45, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Assuming equal chances for having a boy or a girl, the probability of having a boy or a girl at any birth is always 0.5. Thus, the probability of a particular birth order, such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B, is (0.5)^6 due to six births.

Now, let's calculate the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G:
P(G B G B B G) = (0.5)^6 = 1/64 

So, if there are 45 families with this birth order, then the total number of families surveyed would be:
Total families = (number of families with G B G B B G) / (probability of G B G B B G)
Total families = 45 / (1/64) = 45 * 64 = 2880

Now, we can calculate the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by using the same probability:
Estimated families with B G B B B B = (total families) * (probability of B G B B B B)
Estimated families with B G B B B B = 2880 * (0.5)^6 = 2880 * (1/64) = 45 * 6 = 54

Hence, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 54.
