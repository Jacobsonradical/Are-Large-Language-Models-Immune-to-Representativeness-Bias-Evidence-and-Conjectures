{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The problem states that we are looking at families with six children, where the order of birth is G (girl) B (boy) G... is 45.
2. This given order has 3 boys and 3 girls, but we want to find the order with 4 boys and 2 girls (B G B B B B).
3. To estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B order, we can use the same total number of possibilities and apply the same ratio as in the given order.
4. There are a total of 6! (6 factorial) ways to arrange the birth order in six children, which equals 720 possibilities.
5. In the given order (G B G B B G), there are 3! ways to arrange the girls and 3! ways to arrange the boys, giving us a total of 3!*3! = 36 possibilities.
6. Now, we want to find the number of possibilities for the B G B B B B order. There are 2! ways to arrange the girls and 4! ways to arrange the boys, giving us a total of 2!*4! = 48 possibilities.
7. Finally, we divide the total number of possibilities (720) by the number of possibilities in the given order (36) and multiply it by the number of possibilities for the B G B B B B order (48): (720/36)*48 = 54.

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is 54.
