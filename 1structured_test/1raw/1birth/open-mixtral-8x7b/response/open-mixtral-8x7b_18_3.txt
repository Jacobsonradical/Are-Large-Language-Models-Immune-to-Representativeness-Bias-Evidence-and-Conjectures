{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G. Now, let's find out how many families have a different birth order. There are 2^6 = 64 possible combinations of boys (B) and girls (G) for six children. However, we need to exclude the combination G B G B B G, so there are 63 - 1 = 62 possible orders.

Since we are looking for an estimate, we can assume that these 62 orders are equally likely. Therefore, the probability of any specific order is 1/62.

Now, we want to find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. The probability of this order is also 1/62.

So, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

(Number of families) * (Probability of the desired birth order)
45 * (1/62) â‰ˆ 54
