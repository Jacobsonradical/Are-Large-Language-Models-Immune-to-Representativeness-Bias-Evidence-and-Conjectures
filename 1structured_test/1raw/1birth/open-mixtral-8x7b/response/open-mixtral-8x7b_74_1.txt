{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

The probability of a boy or a girl being born is always 0.5, and these probabilities are independent for each birth. So the probability of the sequence G B G B B G is (0.5)^6. 

The question asks for the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, which has the same probability. So, the number of families with this sequence will be the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G.

Since we know there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, and each has a probability of (0.5)^6, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B as follows:

Number of families = Probability * Total number of families

In this case, the total number of families is 45, and the probability is (0.5)^6. So, we can calculate the number of families as:

Number of families = (0.5)^6 * 45

This gives us an estimate of approximately 54 families with the sequence B G B B B B.
