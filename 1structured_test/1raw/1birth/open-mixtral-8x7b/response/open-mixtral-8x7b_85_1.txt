{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G_B_G_B_B_G occurs in 45 families, this means that there are 45 + 1 = 46 opportunities for a family to have a child of a different gender (either a boy or a girl) before starting the sequence again. This is because the first family has an option to start with either a girl or a boy.

Now, we want to find the number of families with the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B. Since this sequence has 6 boys and 0 girls, it is the reverse of the given sequence G_B_G_B_B_G, which has 1 girl and 5 boys. The probability of having this particular sequence is therefore higher due to the higher number of boys in the population.

To estimate the number of families with the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B, we can use the same reasoning as above:

Number of families = (Number of opportunities) x (Probability of this sequence)

The probability of this sequence is 1/2, as there are two possibilities for each birth (boy or girl). Since there are 46 opportunities for a family to have a child of a different gender, the estimated number of families with the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B is:

46 opportunities x 1/2 = 23 families

However, since we are looking for the number of families with at least one child of each gender, we need to account for the fact that there is always a girl before starting the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B. Therefore, the actual number of families with the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B is:

23 families + 1 (for the first girl) = 54 families

Hence, our estimate is 54 families.
