{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the ratio of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G to the total number of families surveyed is known (45 families), we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Let's assume the total number of families surveyed is N. Then, the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is 1/2^6 (since there is a 1/2 chance of having a boy or a girl in each birth). Thus, we have:

(number of families with the birth order G B G B B G) / (total number of families surveyed) = 1/2^6

Substituting the known values, we get:

45 / N = 1/64

Solving for N, we find that N = 45 \* 64 = 2880.

Now, we need to find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. Using the same logic as before, the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is also 1/2^6. So, the number of families with this birth order is:

(number of families with the birth order B G B B B B) / (total number of families surveyed) = 1/2^6

Substituting the estimated value of N, we get:

X / 2880 = 1/64

Solving for X, we find that X = 2880 \* 1/64 = 54.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 54.
