{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, this means that there are 3 boys and 3 girls in these families, with the boy always being born after the girl in the given sequence. For a total of six children, there must be another child of the opposite gender as the last child in the sequence.

Now, let's calculate the probability of having the sequence B G B B B B within these families. In the given sequence G B G B B G, there are 3 boys and 3 girls, so there are 6 possible positions in which to place the extra boy (making it B G B G B B G or G B B G B B G and so on).

The probability of having the sequence B G B B B B is just the inverse of this, which is 1/6. So, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is (45 * 1/6) = 7.5. However, since the number of families must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 8.

However, this calculation assumes that the number of families surveyed is large enough for the observed frequency to be close to the expected frequency. Since the initial sample size is relatively small (45 families), we can expect some deviation. To adjust for this, we should use a conservative adjustment factor, let's say 1.5.

The adjusted estimate is then (8 * 1.5) = 12 families. However, we know that the actual number of families must be an integer. Therefore, a final, more realistic estimate would be the closest integer to the adjusted estimate: 12 rounded to the nearest whole number, which is 12.

This is a rough estimate, and the actual number of families could be different. Nonetheless, using the provided information and making reasonable assumptions, it's plausible that the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be close to 12.
