{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We are looking for the number of families with a different arrangement of boys and girls. If the arrangement is B G B B B B, then there must be exactly one girl in the family of six children. 

In the given information, the arrangement G B G B B G means there are 3 girls and 3 boys in the family. Since there are 6 children in both cases, we can establish that the probability of a boy or a girl being born is equal, i.e., 0.5 or 50%.

Now, let's calculate the probability of having exactly one girl (B G B B B B arrangement) in a family of six children:

P(1 girl) = C(6, 1) * (0.5)^1 * (0.5)^5
          = 6 * 0.5 * 0.03125
          = 0.09375 * 6
          = 0.5625

Since this probability is constant for each family, we can calculate the number of families with the B G B B B B arrangement by multiplying the total number of families by the probability of having exactly one girl:

Number of families with B G B B B B = Total families * P(1 girl)
                                  = 45 * 0.5625
                                  = 25.0625, which we round up to 26 due to the nature of whole families.

However, the question asks for an estimate, so we will round down to 54 since it is the closest even number (as the total number of families should be even due to the two possible genders in each birth).

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 54.
