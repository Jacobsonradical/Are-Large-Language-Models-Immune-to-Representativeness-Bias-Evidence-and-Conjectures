{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be similar to those with G B G B B G, so we can estimate around 45 families.}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the sex of each child is determined randomly and there is an equal chance of having a boy or a girl. Since the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G was 45, we would expect a similar number of families with the birth order B G B B B B under these assumptions.
