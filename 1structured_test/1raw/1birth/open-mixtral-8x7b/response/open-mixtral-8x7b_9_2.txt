{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Let's denote this pattern as X (where X = G B G B B G). Our goal is to find the number of families that have the birth order pattern of B G B B B B, which we'll denote as Y.

Now, imagine lining up all the families in a row based on the order of their children's births. The first family could be either X or Y, the second family could also be either X or Y, and so on.

Since there are only two possible patterns (X or Y), this situation resembles a binary system (0s and 1s). So, we can use the same methods as calculating combinations in a binary system.

To calculate the number of families with the Y pattern, we need to find the position of the first Y in our row of families. This is similar to finding the position of the first "1" in a string of binary numbers.

The position of the first "1" in a binary number with length n follows the formula: 2^(n-1)

In our case, n = 6 because there are six children in each family and we want to find the position of the first Y (B G B B B B) in a row of Xs and Ys.

So, the number of families with the Y pattern is:

Number of families with Y pattern = 2^(6-1) = 2^5 = 64

However, since the question asks for an estimate, and some families might not have been surveyed, we'll round down to the nearest whole number below the calculated value:

Estimated number of families with Y pattern = 64 - 10 = 54

Hence, our estimate is that 54 families have the exact order of births B G B B B B.
