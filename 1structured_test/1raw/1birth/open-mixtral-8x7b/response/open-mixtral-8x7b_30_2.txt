{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, this particular sequence represents a single boy being born in six possible positions (ignoring the girls' positions). For each of these six positions, we can estimate the number of families with a boy in that position by multiplying the number of families with the G B G B B G sequence (45) by the ratio of positions that could contain a boy (6/13, since there are 6 boys and 7 girls in the sequence). This gives us 45 * (6/13) = 20.77 ≈ 21 families for each boy position.

Since we are looking for the number of families with a sequence of B G B B B B, this would mean that all six positions have a boy. Therefore, we multiply the estimated number of families for each boy position (21) by 6, resulting in an estimate of 126 families. However, since the total number of families surveyed is not likely to be a multiple of 13 due to randomness, we should adjust our estimate to be closer to the original 45 families. Dividing 126 by 2.8 (the ratio of the desired sequence's positions to the original sequence's positions, 6 to 13/4.5) gives us an adjusted estimate of 45 * (126 / 2.8) ≈ 54 families.
