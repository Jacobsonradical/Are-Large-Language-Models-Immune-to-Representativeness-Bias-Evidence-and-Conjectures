{answer: The number of families with the order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why: The given data only tells us about the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G. It does not provide any information about other birth order patterns, including B G B B B B. Without this specific data, it is impossible to make an estimate or calculate the exact number of families with the B G B B B B birth order.
