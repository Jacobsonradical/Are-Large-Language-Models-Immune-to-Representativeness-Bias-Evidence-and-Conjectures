{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. There are only two possible sequences for having six children with alternating genders: B G B G B G or G B G B B B.
2. In this city, 45 families were found to have the sequence of G B G B B G.
3. For a random selection of families with six children, we would expect an equal number of families with each gender sequence. Therefore, if there are 45 families with the G B G B B G sequence, we would expect the same number of families to have the B G B B B B sequence.
4. So, our estimate for the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G, which is 45.
5. However, since we are looking for the number of families with six children and the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to calculate the total number of possible orders within that sequence. For six children, there are 720 possible orders (6!, or 6 factorial). With only one gender, there is only one possible sequence, so there are 719 distinct sequences for alternating genders (720 - 1 = 719).
6. Dividing the number of families with the G B G B B G sequence (45) by 2 (since the question asks for the B G B B B B sequence) and then by the number of distinct sequences for alternating genders (719) gives us an estimate of: 45 / (2 * 719) â‰ˆ 0.0312 or 3.12%.
7. Multiplying this percentage by the total number of possible orders for six children (720) gives us an estimated 22.56 families with the sequence B G B B B B. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a family, we must round to the nearest whole number.
8. Therefore, our final estimate is {answer: 54} families with the sequence B G B B B B.
