{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The problem states that we are given the number of families with a specific birth order (G B G B B G) and we want to find the number of families with a different birth order (B G B B B B).
2. Let's use the given information to find the total number of possible birth orders. Since there are six children in each family, there are 2^6 = 64 possible arrangements of boys and girls.
3. We are given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G. This means that there are 64 - 45 = 19 unique birth orders remaining among the families surveyed.
4. To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make an assumption. Let's assume that the distribution of the remaining 19 birth orders is similar to the distribution of all 64 possible birth orders.
5. In this case, we can estimate that the birth order B G B B B B makes up about 1/64 of all possible birth orders (since there is only one way to arrange B G B B B B out of six children).
6. Therefore, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be approximately (1/64) * (total number of families surveyed).
7. Rearranging the formula, we get: total number of families surveyed ≈ (number of families with birth order B G B B B B) * 64.
8. Now we can plug in our given value of 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G: total number of families surveyed ≈ (1) * 64 / (1/64) * 45 ≈ 54.
