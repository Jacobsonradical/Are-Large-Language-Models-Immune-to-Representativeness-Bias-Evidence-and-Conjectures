{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is 45, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Assuming an equal probability of having a boy or a girl (0.5 probability for each), the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is equal to the product of the individual probabilities: (0.5 for a girl) * (0.5 for a boy) * (0.5 for a girl) * (0.5 for a boy) * (0.5 for a boy) * (0.5 for a girl) = 0.078125.

Now, since there are 7! / (2!*5!) = 21 different birth order combinations with 4 girls and 3 boys (or 4 boys and 3 girls), the probability of having any of these 21 combinations is 21 * 0.078125 = 1.640625. However, this value is greater than 1, which indicates that our assumption of equal probabilities may not be accurate.

In reality, the actual number of families with a particular birth order combination depends on factors like the human sex ratio at birth (approximately 0.51), age of parents, and other genetic and environmental factors. However, to make a rough estimate based on the given data, let's continue with the assumption of equal probabilities.

Since the total probability of having any of the 21 combinations is approximately 1.64, we can estimate that the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B (which is one of these 21 combinations) is about 1/21 of the total probability, or approximately 0.078125 / 21 ≈ 0.00372.

Finally, to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the proportion of this birth order among all possible combinations:

Number of families with the birth order B G B B B B ≈ (0.00372) * (total number of families surveyed).

Rearranging the formula to isolate the total number of families surveyed, we get:

Total number of families surveyed ≈ Number of families with the birth order B G B B B B / 0.00372.

Substituting the given information (45 families with the birth order G B G B B G and our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B), we get:

Total number of families surveyed ≈ 45 / 0.00372 ≈ 12096.3.

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round it to 12096.

Now, to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can multiply the proportion of this birth order (0.00372) by the total number of families (12096):

Number of families with the birth order B G B B B B ≈ 12096 * 0.00372 ≈ 45.

However, this estimate is very close to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G (45), which raises the possibility that the given data might not be representative or reliable. Nonetheless, based on the provided information, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is approximately 45.
