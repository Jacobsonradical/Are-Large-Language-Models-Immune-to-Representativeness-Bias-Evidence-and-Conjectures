{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, this means that there are 4 boys and 2 girls in those families' birth order. This is because the pattern shows that after having a girl (G), they have 2 boys (B), then another girl (G), and then 2 more boys (B).

Now, let's consider families with the sequence B G B B B B, which consists of 3 girls and 3 boys. Since both sequences have the same number of boys, we can find the relationship between them by comparing the girls' positions. In the first sequence (G B G B B G), there is one more girl than in the second sequence (B G B B B B). This extra girl in the first sequence can be placed in 6 different positions, as she can be positioned between any pair of siblings in the second sequence, or be the first or last child.

Therefore, if the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, the sequence B G B B B B (with 3 girls) should occur in 45/6 â‰ˆ 7.5 families. However, since we cannot have half a family, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 8 families.

However, this method of estimating might not be precise, as it assumes that all boy-girl combinations are equally likely. To account for randomness and sample variation, we can multiply our initial estimate by a factor of 2 or 3, which would give us an estimate of around 14 to 21 families.

Considering that our estimation is already a rough one, we can choose a round number close to our estimate. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be:
