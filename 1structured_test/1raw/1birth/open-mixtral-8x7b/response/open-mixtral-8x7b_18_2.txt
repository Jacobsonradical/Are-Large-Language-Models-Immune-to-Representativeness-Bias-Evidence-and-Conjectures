{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined exactly from the given information. However, based on the given data, we can estimate that the ratio of families with the birth orders G B G B B G and B G B B B B is 45:45 = 1:1. Therefore, it is reasonable to estimate that roughly half of the surveyed families, or around 45 families, had the birth order B G B B B B.}
