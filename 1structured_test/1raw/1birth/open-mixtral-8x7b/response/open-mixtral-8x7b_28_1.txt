{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be similar to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, so it is estimated to be 45.}

This answer is based on the assumption that the gender of each child in a family is determined randomly and independently of the gender of the other children, so the probability of having a boy or a girl as the first child is the same, and the probability of having a boy or a girl as the second child is also the same, and so on. Therefore, the pattern B G B B B G is just as likely as the pattern B G B B B B, and since 45 families were found to have the first pattern, we would expect a similar number of families to have the second pattern.
