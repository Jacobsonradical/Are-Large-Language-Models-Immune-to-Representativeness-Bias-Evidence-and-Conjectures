{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the total number of families surveyed is not given, we cannot determine the exact number of families with a specific birth order. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the information provided.

The order G B G B B G has 3 girls and 3 boys, so it's evenly split. We know that this pattern occurred in 45 families. Now let's consider the opposite pattern - B G B B B B, which has 3 boys and 3 girls. If the gender distribution is equal among all families, we would expect the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern to be similar to those with the G B G B B G pattern.

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B would be:

(number of G B G B B G families) * (expected ratio of B G B B B B families)
= 45 * (3 boys : 3 girls ratio)
= 45 * 2
= 90 / 2 (since we want the number of families, not the ratio)
= 45

However, considering that the total number of families may not be a multiple of 3, and there might be some variations in gender distribution, a more reasonable estimate would be to round down to the nearest whole number:
