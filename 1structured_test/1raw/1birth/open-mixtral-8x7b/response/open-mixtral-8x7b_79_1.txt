{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the ratio of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G to the total number of families surveyed is known (45 families), we can use this information to find the total number of families surveyed. 

Let's assume the total number of families surveyed is N. We are asked to find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, which is represented as M.

Since the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5), the probability of having a boy followed by a girl (BG) is also 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

For the birth order G B G B B G, the probability is 0.25 * 1 * 0.25 * 0.25 * 1 * 0.25 = (0.25)^4.

Similarly, for the birth order B G B B B B, the probability is 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = (0.5)^6.

Given that there are N families surveyed, and there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can write the equation:

45 = N * (0.25)^4

Now, to find M (the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B), we can write the equation:

M = N * (0.5)^6

We need to find M, but we only have one equation with N. To overcome this, let's express N in terms of M using the first equation:

N = 45 / (0.25)^4

Now, substitute N into the equation for M:

M = (45 / (0.25)^4) * (0.5)^6

Calculate M:

M = 54

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 54.
