{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Let's consider the number of ways we can arrange the six children in a family, given that there are two genders. For each child, there are two possibilities (boy or girl), so for six children, there are 2^6 = 64 different combinations.

However, we have to subtract one combination from this total, which is all girls (G G G G G G), since it doesn't fit our criteria. So, we have 64 - 1 = 63 possible combinations for the order of boys and girls in a family of six.

Now, we are asked to find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. Since we already know one specific arrangement (G B G B B G), we can estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B order by assuming equal distribution of the other 62 valid arrangements across the 45 families we know have at least one boy and one girl.

So, our estimate would be 62 arrangements * (45 families / 62 arrangements) = 45 families. However, since we excluded the all-girls combination, we need to add back one to our estimate: 45 + 1 = 46.

However, considering that the original data is discrete, rounding down to 46 might be slightly inaccurate. Thus, a more reasonable estimate would be 45 + 1/2 = 45.5. To keep the answer in whole numbers, we can round it up to 46 or down to 45. I will provide the answer as 45, considering the estimation method used.
