{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is 45, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Assuming equal probabilities for boys and girls, the chance of having a boy or a girl is always 0.5. To find the probability of the sequence GBGBBG, we multiply the probabilities for each event:

0.5 (girl) * 0.5 (boy) * 0.5 (girl) * 0.5 (boy) * 0.5 (boy) * 0.5 (girl) = 0.015625

Now, to estimate the number of families with the sequence BGBBBB, we simply reverse the order and multiply the probability by the total number of families surveyed (which we don't know, so let's call it N):

0.5 (boy) * 0.5 (girl) * 0.5 (boy) * 0.5 (boy) * 0.5 (boy) * 0.5 (girl) = 0.015625

N * 0.015625 = 45 (families with the GBGBBG sequence)

Now, we can solve for N:

N = 45 / 0.015625
N = 2872

Now, using this estimated total number of families surveyed, we can calculate the number of families with the BGBBBB sequence:

Number of families with BGBBBB = 2872 * 0.015625 = 54 (approximately)
