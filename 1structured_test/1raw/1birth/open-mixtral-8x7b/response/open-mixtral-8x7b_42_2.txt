{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The problem states that we're looking at families with six children, where the order of boys (B) and girls (G) is G B G B B G.
2. Now, let's consider the number of ways to rearrange the birth order to have all boys born first, followed by girls: B G B G B B.
3. To do this, we need to calculate the number of permutations of this new sequence.
4. There are 6! (6 factorial) ways to arrange the letters GBBGBB, which equals 720.
5. However, we must consider that there are two instances where two girls (G) are together, which reduces the number of unique arrangements.
6. To account for this, divide the total number of arrangements by 2! for each pair of girls, which is 2.
7. So, (720 / 2) / 2 = 180.
8. Since the original sequence G B G B B G was found in 45 families, to find the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B G B B, we can take the total number of families surveyed and subtract the number of families with the original sequence, which is assumed to be representative.
9. Therefore, the estimate for families with the sequence B G B G B B would be 45 * 2 = 90.
10. However, due to the approximation in this question, it is more reasonable to round the number to the nearest whole number, which is 54.
