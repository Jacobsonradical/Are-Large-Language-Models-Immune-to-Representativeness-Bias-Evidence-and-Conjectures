{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Since the ratio of boys to girls in the target birth order (B G B B B B) is 3:3, this particular birth order pattern should occur as frequently as the given pattern (G B G B B G), which has a ratio of 3:3 as well.
2. The question states that the birth order pattern G B G B B G was found in 45 families.
3. To find the estimated number of families with the birth order pattern B G B B B B, we can use the same number since both patterns have the same ratio of boys to girls.
4. Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order pattern B G B B B B is also 45.

However, upon closer inspection, the given pattern (G B G B B G) has one more girl than boys, while the target pattern (B G B B B B) has one more boy than girls. To account for this difference, we need to adjust our estimate by adding 1 family for each girl "missing" in the target pattern.

5. Since there are 3 girls in the target pattern and 1 more boy than girls, we need to add 3 - 1 = 2 families to the estimate.
6. Thus, the corrected estimate for the number of families with the birth order pattern B G B B B B is 45 + 2 = 54 families.
