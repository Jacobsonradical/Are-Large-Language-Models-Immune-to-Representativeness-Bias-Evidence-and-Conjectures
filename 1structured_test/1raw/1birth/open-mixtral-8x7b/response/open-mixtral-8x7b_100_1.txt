{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

The probability of a boy or a girl being born is always 0.5, and these probabilities are independent. So the probability of the sequence G B G B B G is (0.5)^6.

Since there are 45 families with this sequence, we can calculate the total number of families surveyed by dividing the number of families by the probability of this sequence:

Total number of families = 45 / (0.5)^6

Now, let's calculate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. The probability for this sequence is also (0.5)^6, so we can find the number of families by multiplying the total number of families by the probability of this sequence:

Number of families with B G B B B B = Total number of families * (0.5)^6
Number of families with B G B B B B = (45 / (0.5)^6) * (0.5)^6
Number of families with B G B B B B = 45

However, this answer is less than the actual number of families surveyed, which means some families must have had repeated sequences. In this case, the sequence G B G B B G has only two repeats: G B G B G _ and _ B G B B G. For any other sequence, the number of repeats would be six.

To estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we need to account for these repeats. There are 6 choose 2 ways to arrange the repeats in the sequence G B G B B G, which is 15. So the actual number of families with the sequence B G B B B B will be:

Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = Number of families with G B G B B G / 15
Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = 45 / 15

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is 3. However, since the total number of families surveyed is not a multiple of 15, there must be an error in the initial data or calculation. Assuming the initial data is correct, we should round up to the nearest multiple of 15, which is 45 / 15 * 15 = 54.
