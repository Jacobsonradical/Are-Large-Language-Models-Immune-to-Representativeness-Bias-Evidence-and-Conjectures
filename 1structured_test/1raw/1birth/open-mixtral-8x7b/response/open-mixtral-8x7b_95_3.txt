{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. The problem states that all families of six children in a city were surveyed.
2. In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
3. Now we want to find out how many families have the birth order B G B B B B.
4. To maintain gender balance, every time a boy is born, there should be a girl born as well to keep the total number of children equal to six.
5. So, for every B G combination, we will have one valid sequence of B G B G B B.
6. Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by dividing the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G by the number of B G combinations within that sequence.
7. The sequence G B G B B G has two B G combinations (the first two children and the last two children).
8. Dividing the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G (45) by the number of B G combinations (2) gives us an estimate of 22.5 families.
9. However, since we cannot have half a family, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 23 families.
10. However, this estimate assumes that all families have at least one instance of the B G combination. To account for families where the birth order starts with a girl (G), we need to add those cases too.
11. If a family starts with a girl, then there will be three instances of the B G combination in the sequence B G B G B B.
12. To find out how many families start with a girl, we can use the same reasoning as before: dividing the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G (45) by the number of children (6) gives us 7.5 families.
13. Again, rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get 8 families that start with a girl.
14. Adding the two estimates together (23 + 8), we get a final estimate of 54 families with the birth order B G B B B B.
