{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the gender of each child is determined randomly, we can use the binomial probability formula to estimate the number of families with a specific gender sequence. 

For the sequence B G B B B B, the probability of this occurrence is 0.5 (probability of a boy) multiplied by itself six times, which equals 0.015625.

In the survey, 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G. The total number of possible sequences for six children is 2^6 = 64.

So, if we multiply the total number of sequences (64) by the probability of the desired sequence (0.015625), we get approximately 1.000000. However, this implies that there should be one family with that sequence. Since this is not possible due to the granularity of whole families, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, we estimate that there would be 54 families with the sequence B G B B B B.
