{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

The given information allows us to know the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, but it does not provide enough information to determine how many families have any other specific birth order pattern, such as B G B B B B. To estimate the number of families with this birth order pattern, we would need additional information, such as the total number of families surveyed or the number of families with a specific number of boys and girls.
