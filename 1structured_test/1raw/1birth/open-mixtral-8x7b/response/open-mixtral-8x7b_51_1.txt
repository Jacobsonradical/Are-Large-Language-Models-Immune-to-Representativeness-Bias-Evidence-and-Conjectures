{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is 45, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. This is because there are as many ways to arrange "boy, girl" (BG) six times as there are to arrange "girl, boy" (GB) six times; this is a total of 6! (6 factorial) ways in each case.

The formula to calculate the number of permutations (arrangements) for BG or GB six times is:

Permutations = Number of elements! / (Number of one element! * Number of the other element!)

For BG (boy, girl) six times:
Permutations = 6! / (2! * 4!)
= (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((2*1) * (4*3*2*1))
= 15

Since we are looking for the number of families with boys first (B G ...), we need to divide this number by 2, as there are equally likely scenarios where the boy is born first or second:

Estimated number of families = 15 / 2 = 7.5

However, since we cannot have half a family, we round it to the nearest whole number, which is 8.

But, this estimation might slightly overestimate or underestimate the actual number of families. To adjust for this, we can take the average of the estimated number (8) and the number of G B G B B G families (45) divided by 2:

Adjusted estimation = (8 + 45) / 2 = 53.5

Again, since we cannot have half a family, we round it to the nearest whole number, which is 54.

Thus, our final estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births is B G B B B B is around 54.
