{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

The text states that we have information about families with the birth order G B G B B G, but it does not provide any information about families with any other birth order patterns, such as B G B B B B. Without this information, we cannot estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern.
