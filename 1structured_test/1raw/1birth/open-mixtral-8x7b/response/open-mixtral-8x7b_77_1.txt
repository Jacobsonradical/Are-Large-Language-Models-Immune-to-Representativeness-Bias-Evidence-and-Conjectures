{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

The text states that the survey results were provided for families with a specific birth order (G B G B B G), but no information was given about other birth order patterns, including families with the birth order B G B B B B. Therefore, we cannot estimate the number of families with this particular birth order based on the given information.
