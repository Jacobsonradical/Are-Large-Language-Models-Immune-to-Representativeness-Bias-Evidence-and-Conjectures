{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We are looking for the number of families that have the birth order B G B B B B. Given that we know there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the desired birth order.

Let's assume that the gender of each child is determined randomly and that there is an equal chance of having a boy or a girl (50% chance for each gender). Under these assumptions, the probability of having a boy (B) is the same as having a girl (G), which is 0.5 or 50%.

Now, let's calculate the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G. There are six positions, and the probability of arranging the sequence G B G B B G is:

0.5 (G) * 0.5 (B) * 0.5 (G) * 0.5 (B) * 0.5 (B) * 0.5 (G) = 0.015625

Since we know there are 45 families with this birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing the number of families with the known birth order by the probability of that birth order:

Total number of families = Number of families with known birth order / Probability of known birth order

Total number of families = 45 / 0.015625 = 2,875

Now, we can calculate the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B, which is the same as the probability of having the previous birth order:

Probability of B G B B B B = Probability of G B G B B G = 0.015625

Finally, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by multiplying the total number of families by the probability of having this birth order:

Number of families with B G B B B B = Total number of families * Probability of B G B B B B
Number of families with B G B B B B = 2,875 * 0.015625 = 44.6875

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number:
