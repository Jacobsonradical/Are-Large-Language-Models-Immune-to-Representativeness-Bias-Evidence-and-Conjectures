{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Since the gender of each child can be either boy or girl, there are 2 possibilities for each birth.
2. For the given order of G B G B B G, there are 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64 possible combinations.
3. In the question, we are given that this sequence (G B G B B G) was found in 45 families.
4. Now, let's consider the sequence of B G B B B B. This sequence also has 2 possibilities for each birth, so there are 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64 possible combinations for this sequence as well.
5. Since the total number of families surveyed is not given, we cannot provide an exact number of families with the B G B B B B sequence. However, we can estimate it based on the given information.
6. If the 64 possible combinations of the G B G B B G sequence were all unique (which is unlikely but makes for a simpler estimate), then we could assume that the 64 possible combinations of the B G B B B B sequence are also all unique in the surveyed families.
7. Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the number of families surveyed with the B G B B B B sequence would be similar to the number of families with the G B G B B G sequence, which is 64/45 * 64 â‰ˆ 54.

Hence, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 54.
