{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

The problem state that we are looking for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. Since we know that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the desired birth order.

In this context, we can assume that the gender of each child is determined randomly and that there is an equal chance of having a boy or a girl. Therefore, for every birth order where boys and girls alternate (like G B G B B G), there should be a corresponding birth order where boys and girls are in the opposite sequence (like B G B B B B).

Since there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate that there would be the same number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. This is because, on average, there is no reason to favor one sequence over the other, given the random nature of gender determination.

Hence, our estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 45. However, since there are only two possible sequences for the six children's genders, we can also estimate that the other sequence (B G B B B B) would have an equal number of families. Therefore, we can double our initial estimate to account for both possibilities. Thus, our final estimate of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 45 * 2 = 54.
