{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We are looking for the number of families with a different gender sequence (B G B B B B) than the one given (G B G B B G). To find this, we can use the concept of permutations.

First, let's find the total number of possible sequences for six children, considering two possibilities for each birth (boy or girl):
2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 64 possible sequences

Now, we know that one of these sequences is the given sequence (G B G B B G), so there are 64 - 1 = 63 remaining unique sequences.

However, since the question asks for the "exact order of births," we need to consider that changing the sequence while keeping the same number of boys and girls will not count as a different sequence (e.g., B G B B G B is the same as B B G B G B B). To account for this, we will divide the total number of unique sequences by 2! for every pair of boys and 2! for every pair of girls.

So, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be 63 / (2!*2!*2!) = 63 / 8 = 54 families.
