{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is 45, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. 

Assuming an equal probability of having a boy or a girl, the chance of having a boy or a girl in each birth would be 1/2 (0.5).

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to consider two scenarios - having a boy first and then a girl, and having a girl first and then a boy.

Scenario 1: Boy first, then girl
- The probability of having a boy first is 0.5.
- In the remaining 5 births, the probability of having the birth order G B B B B is 0.5^5 = 0.03125.
- So, the probability for Scenario 1 is 0.5 * 0.03125 = 0.015625.

Scenario 2: Girl first, then boy
- The probability of having a girl first is 0.5.
- In the remaining 5 births, the probability of having the birth order B B B B B is 0.5^5 = 0.03125.
- So, the probability for Scenario 2 is 0.5 * 0.03125 = 0.015625.

Now, we'll sum the probabilities of Scenarios 1 and 2 to get the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

0.015625 + 0.015625 = 0.03125

To get the estimated number of families, we divide the probability by the probability of having a boy or a girl (0.5) squared, as we have two children at the beginning:

0.03125 / (0.5 * 0.5) = 0.03125 / 0.25 = 0.125

Finally, we multiply this probability by the total number of families surveyed (45) to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

0.125 * 45 = 5.625 â‰ˆ 54 (when rounding to the nearest whole number)
