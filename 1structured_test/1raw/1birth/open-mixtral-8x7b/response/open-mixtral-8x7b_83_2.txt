{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, this means that there are 4 boy-births and 2 girl-births in those families. Since there are always 2 genders in a family, the other possible sequence with the same number of boys and girls is B G B B B B.

Now, since all families with six children were surveyed, and we have 45 families who follow the sequence of G B G B B G, then the remaining families must follow the sequence of B G B B B B.

To estimate the number of families following the sequence B G B B B B, we can use the following formula:

number of families = (number of families surveyed) / (number of possible sequences)

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, the total number of sequences for six children is 6! (6 factorial), which equals 720.

Now, we can find the number of families following the sequence B G B B B B:

number of families = 45 / (6!) = 45 / 720 ≈ 0.0625

Since the number of families should be a whole number, we multiply the above result by 720 (the total number of sequences):

number of families = 0.0625 * 720 ≈ 45

However, since 45 families are already accounted for with the sequence G B G B B G, we need to estimate the next closest whole number:

number of families = 54

Therefore, our estimate is that 54 families surveyed had the exact order of births as B G B B B B.
