{answer: To provide an accurate estimate, we would need to know the gender ratio at birth. However, if we assume a 50/50 chance for each gender, the probability of having a boy or a girl is the same (0.5). Given this assumption, the probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B is equal to the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G (which is (0.5)^6 since there are 6 births). Therefore, if 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, we would expect the same number of families to have the birth order B G B B B B. So, our estimate is 45 families.}
