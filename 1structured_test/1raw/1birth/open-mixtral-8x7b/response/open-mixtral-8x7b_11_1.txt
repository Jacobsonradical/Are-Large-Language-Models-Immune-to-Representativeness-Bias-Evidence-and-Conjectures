{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that in 45 families the order is G B G B B G.

Let's consider this as one cycle of boy (B) and girl (G) births. So, each cycle contains 2 girls and 3 boys.

Now, we want to find out how many cycles are there in total families considering the desired order B G B B B B. Each cycle contains 2 boys and 1 girl.

To maintain the gender ratio, the total number of cycles must be even because an even number of cycles will ensure that the total count of boys and girls is equal.

Let's assume that there are 'x' number of these special cycles (B G B B B B) in the total families. So, for every two special cycles, there is one regular cycle (G B G B B G). Thus, the relationship between special and regular cycles can be written as:

2x = x + 45

This simplifies to:

x = 45

This means that there are 45 special cycles (B G B B B B) in the total families. However, since we are interested in the number of families, we need to divide this by the number of cycles per family, which is 6 (one boy or girl at a time):

Number of Families = Special Cycles / Cycles per Family
= 45 / 6
= 7.5

Since the number of families should be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 8.

However, rounding up may introduce some error in our estimation since it assumes that all 45 regular cycles are complete. To adjust for this, let's calculate how many extra families we might have counted:

Additional Families = Extra Regular Cycles
= (8 * 6) - 45
= 48 - 45
= 3

To correct our estimate, we subtract these extra families from our rounded value:

Corrected Estimate = Rounded Value - Additional Families
= 8 - 3
= 5

Therefore, our final estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is 5 more than the rounded value, which is 54.
