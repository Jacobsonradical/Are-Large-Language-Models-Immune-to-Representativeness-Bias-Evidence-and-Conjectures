{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is 45, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. 

Assuming equal chances for having a boy or a girl, the probability of having a boy is 0.5 and the probability of having a girl is also 0.5. 

To find the probability of the birth order G B G B B G, we can multiply the probabilities of each individual event occurring in that order: (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.015625.

Since there are six possible orders for having three girls and three boys (given by the six permutations of the set {B, B, B, G, G, G}), the probability of any of these orders is six times the above probability: 6 * 0.015625 = 0.09375.

Now, we need to find the probability of the birth order B G B B B B, which is calculated the same way: (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.015625.

Since the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is the same as having the birth order G B G B B G, and we know that 45 families have the G B G B B G order, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:

45 * (0.015625 / 0.09375) = 45 * (1 / 6) = 7.5

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 8. However, it is important to note that rounding should be done carefully when estimating, as it may not always provide accurate results.

A more accurate estimate can be obtained by considering the total number of possible birth orders for six children, which is 720 (6!). The probability of having any of the six orders we are interested in (B G B B B B, B B G B B G, B B B G B B, B B B B G B, B B B B B G, G B G B B B) is 6 times the probability we calculated earlier: 6 * 0.09375 = 0.5625. Therefore, the number of families with one of these six orders is:

45 * (0.5625 / 0.09375) = 45 * 6 = 270

Now, divide this number by 6 to get the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B: 270 / 6 = 45.

However, this estimate is likely still an overestimation because it assumes equal chances for having a boy or a girl, which may not be the case in the city surveyed. To avoid overestimation, we can use the initial estimate of rounding up to the nearest whole number (8) and consider the fact that the actual number of families with the birth order B G B B B B could be lower than this estimate.

Taking into account the equal chances assumption, the most likely estimate is halfway between 45 * (1 / 6) and 45, which is 45 * (1 / 12) = 3.75. Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get 4. However, since the initial estimate was increased by 1 due to rounding, we can reduce the estimate by 1 to counteract this effect. Thus, the final estimate is:

4 - 1 =
