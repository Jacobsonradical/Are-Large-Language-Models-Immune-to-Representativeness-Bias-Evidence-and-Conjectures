{answer: The number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B would be statistically similar to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, so it is estimated to be around 45.}

Here's the reasoning:
1. The question states that the survey was conducted across all families of six children in the city.
2. The number of possible birth orders for six children is 2^6 = 64, since each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G).
3. The question provides the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, which is 45.
4. Since the survey covered all families, the other birth orders should also be roughly equally represented, assuming roughly equal probabilities for boys and girls.
5. Therefore, it is reasonable to estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also around 45.
