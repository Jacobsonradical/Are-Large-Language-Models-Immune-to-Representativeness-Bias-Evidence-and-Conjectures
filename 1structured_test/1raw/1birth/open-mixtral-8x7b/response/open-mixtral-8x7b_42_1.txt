{answer: The number of families with the B G B B B B pattern cannot be definitively estimated from the information provided. However, if we assume that the gender of each child is determined randomly and independently, we can use the concept of probability to make an estimate.

In the G B G B B G pattern, there are 3 girls and 3 boys among the six children. The probability of this happening is (1/2)^6 = 1/64. 

The B G B B B B pattern is the reverse of this, so it also has a probability of (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Since the survey results showed 45 families with the G B G B B G pattern, and assuming these results are representative, we could estimate that there would be a similar number of families with the B G B B B B pattern. So, our estimate would be around 45 families.

Please note that this is a statistical estimate based on certain assumptions and the actual number could be different.}
