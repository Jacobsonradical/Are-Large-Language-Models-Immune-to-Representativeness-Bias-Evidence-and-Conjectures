{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that the genders of the children are determined randomly and independently, we can calculate the probability of this birth order and use it to make an estimate. The probability of having a boy or a girl at each birth is 0.5. Therefore, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64. If we assume that the number of families with each birth order is equally likely, we would expect approximately 45 / 64 â‰ˆ 0.7 families to have the birth order B G B B B B. However, this is only an estimate and the actual number could be different.}
