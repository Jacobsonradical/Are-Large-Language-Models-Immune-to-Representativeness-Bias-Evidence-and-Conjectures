{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that boy and girl births are equally likely and independent, we can estimate the number of families with this birth order using the same probability as for G B G B B G. Since the probability of a boy or girl birth is 0.5, the probability of G B G B B G is (0.5)^6. Therefore, the estimated number of families with birth order B G B B B B would be the same as the number of families with birth order G B G B B G, which is 45. Hence, the estimate is 45 families.}
