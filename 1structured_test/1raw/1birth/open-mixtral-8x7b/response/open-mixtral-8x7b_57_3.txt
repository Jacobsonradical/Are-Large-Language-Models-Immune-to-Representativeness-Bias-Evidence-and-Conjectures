{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G_B_G_B_B_G occurs in 45 families, this means that the sequence _B_G_B_B_B_G (with an unknown gender in the first position) also occurs in the same number of families, since we can just shift the whole sequence to start from the first boy.

Now, we need to estimate how many families would have the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B (with a boy in the first position) out of the families with the sequence _B_G_B_B_B_G. Since the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5), the probability of adding a boy in the first position is also 0.5.

So, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B as:

45 * 0.5 = 22.5

However, since the number of families must be a whole number, we round this value to the closest whole number, which is 23 or 54 when doubled to account for both sequences (B_G_B_B_B_B and G_B_G_B_B_B_G).

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B_G_B_B_B_B is 54.
