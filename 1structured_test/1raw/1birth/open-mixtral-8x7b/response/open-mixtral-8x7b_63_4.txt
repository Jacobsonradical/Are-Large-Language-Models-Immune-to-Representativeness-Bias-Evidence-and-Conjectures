{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the given data.}

Here's why: The information provided only relates to the number of families with a specific birth order pattern of G B G B B G. We don't have any data about other birth order patterns, including B G B B B B. In order to estimate the number of families with this pattern, we would need additional information about the distribution of birth orders in the city.
