{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that the gender of each child is determined randomly and independently, we can calculate the probability of this birth order and use it to make an estimate. The probability of a boy (B) is 0.5 and the probability of a girl (G) is also 0.5. Therefore, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625. If we multiply this probability by the total number of families surveyed, we get an estimate of 45 * 0.015625 = 0.7 families. However, this is not a whole number, which is not possible since the number of families must be a whole number. Therefore, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 1 family.}
