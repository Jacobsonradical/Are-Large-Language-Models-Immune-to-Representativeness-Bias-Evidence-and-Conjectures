{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

The text only states that 45 families had the birth order of G B G B B G. However, it does not provide any information about the number of families with any other birth order patterns, including B G B B B B. Since we don't have enough information about the distribution of other birth order patterns, it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
