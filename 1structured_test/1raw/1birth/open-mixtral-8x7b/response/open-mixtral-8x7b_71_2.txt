{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We are looking for the number of families with a specific birth order pattern, which is B G B B B B. 

In the survey, we found that the pattern G B G B B G occurred in 45 families. This pattern has 3 girls (G) and 3 boys (B), just like our desired pattern (B G B B B B), but with a different arrangement.

Since there are two possible arrangements for each gender in these families (boy or girl), there are 2^6 = 64 different ways to arrange the birth order for a family of six children with an equal number of boys and girls.

Half of these arrangements will have the boys born first, and the other half will have the girls born first. So, there are 64 / 2 = 32 distinct boy-first arrangements.

Among these 32 arrangements, we already know one that was observed in the survey (G B G B B G). To estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern, we can assume that the occurrences of this pattern are equally likely. Therefore, we can estimate that the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern is 45 / 2 â‰ˆ 54.

So, our estimate is {answer: 54} families surveyed with the B G B B B B pattern.
