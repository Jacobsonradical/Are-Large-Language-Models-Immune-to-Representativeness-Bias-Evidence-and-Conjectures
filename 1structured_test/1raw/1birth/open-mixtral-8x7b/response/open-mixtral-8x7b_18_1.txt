{answer: The number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B would be around 36, assuming equal probabilities for boys and girls.}

Here's the reasoning:
1. In the original survey data, there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G.
2. Since the number of boys and girls is equal in both sequences, we can infer that there are 3 boys and 3 girls in the G B G B B G sequence.
3. To find the sequence B G B B B B, we simply switch the positions of the first boy and the first girl in the G B G B B G sequence.
4. Based on this, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would also be around 36, assuming equal probabilities for boys and girls.

Please note that this is an estimate, as actual birth statistics might vary slightly, and our assumption of equal probabilities for boys and girls might not always hold true.
