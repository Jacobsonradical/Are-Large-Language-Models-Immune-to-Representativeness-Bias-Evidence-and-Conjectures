{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why: The given information only states that there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G. It doesn't provide any information about other birth order patterns, including B G B B B B. Without this information, we can't estimate the number of families with this specific birth order pattern.
