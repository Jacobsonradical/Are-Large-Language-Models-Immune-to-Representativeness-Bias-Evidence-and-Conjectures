{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G_B_G_B_B_G occurs in 45 families, we can assume that the gender of the first child is always female, and the gender of the last child is always male (since there are 6 children in total). This leaves us with 4 slots to fill for boys or girls, and since there are more boys in the sequence, we can calculate the probability of having a boy or a girl based on the sex ratio.

The problem states that we are surveying all families in the city, so this should give us a good estimate of the number of families with a different sequence, such as B_G_B_B_B_B.

The probability of having a boy (B) is 0.51 (slightly more than 50%), and the probability of having a girl (G) is 0.49. Since there are 4 slots to fill for boys or girls, the probability of having the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B is:

0.51 * 0.49 * 0.51 * 0.51 * 0.51 * 0.49 ≈ 0.0674

To estimate the number of families with the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B, we can multiply the probability by the total number of families surveyed:

45 * 0.0674 ≈ 3.023 or approximately 3 families (since we can't have a fraction of a family).

However, we need to account for the fact that there are two possible sequences that start with a girl and end with a boy: G_B_G_B_B_G and B_G_B_B_B_B. Since the problem only states that we have seen one of these sequences in 45 families, we need to double our estimate to account for the other possible sequence:

2 * 3 ≈ 6

Therefore, our final estimate for the number of families with the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B is around 6 families. However, since we are looking for an estimate, we can round to the nearest whole number:

This estimate is based on the assumption that the gender ratio is exactly 50/50 and that the sample size is representative of the entire city's population. In reality, the actual number could be slightly different due to factors such as sampling error or natural variations in gender ratios.
