{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

The problem states that we are looking at families with six children, and the order of births G B G B B G (where G represents a girl and B represents a boy) was found in 45 families. This gives us a clue about the gender ratio in the population being studied.

Since there are six children in each family, and the order G B G B B G has one girl and one boy, we can estimate that half of the remaining four children are boys and half are girls. So, in this particular order, three boys and three girls would be split among families as follows:

- 2 girls and 1 boy: 3! / (2! * 1!) = 3 ways
- 1 girl and 2 boys: 3! / (1! * 2!) = 3 ways
- 3 boys and 3 girls: 3! / (3!) = 1 way

Now, let's calculate the probability of having three boys and three girls in any order by adding up these possibilities:

P(3 boys and 3 girls) = P(2 girls and 1 boy) + P(1 girl and 2 boys) + P(3 boys and 3 girls)
P(3 boys and 3 girls) = (3/64) + (3/64) + (1/64) = 7/64

Next, we want to find the order B G B B B B, which is the reverse of the order given in the question (G B G B B G). Since the probability of having three boys and three girls is the same for both orders, we can use the probability we just calculated.

Given that the probability of having three boys and three girls is 7/64, we can now estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B:

Number of families = Total families * P(3 boys and 3 girls)
Number of families = Total families * (7/64)

We are given that there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G. To solve for the total number of families, we can use the following equation:

Total families = 45 * (64/7)
Total families â‰ˆ 54 * 64

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births is B G B B B B is approximately 54.
