{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be similar to those with G B G B B G, so a reasonable estimate would be around 45 families.}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the gender of each child is determined randomly and there is an equal chance of having a boy or a girl. Therefore, the arrangement of boys and girls in the family would have the same probability. Since the order B G B B B G was observed in 45 families, it is reasonable to assume that the opposite arrangement, G B B B B B, would also be found in a similar number of families if the survey was repeated under the same conditions.
