{answer: The number of families with the order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why: The given data only tells us the number of families with the order G B G B B G. In order to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we would need to know the total number of families surveyed and the proportion of families with boy-girl patterns in their birth order. Without this additional information, it is impossible to make an accurate estimate.
