{answer: The number of families with the B G B B B B pattern would be similar to those with the G B G B B G pattern, so a reasonable estimate would be around 45 families.}

This answer is based on the assumption that the gender of each child is determined randomly and independently of their siblings' genders. Under this assumption, the sequence of boys and girls should be evenly distributed, and the number of families with a particular sequence should be similar to the number of families with the reverse sequence. Since 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate that around 45 families also had the sequence B G B B B B.
