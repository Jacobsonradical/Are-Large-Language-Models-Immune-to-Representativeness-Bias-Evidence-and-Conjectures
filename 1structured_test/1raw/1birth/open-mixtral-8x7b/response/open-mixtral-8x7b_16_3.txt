{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why: While the question states that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, it does not provide enough information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of other birth order patterns, such as B G B B B B. Thus, we cannot estimate the number of families with this particular birth order pattern.
