{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

The problem mentions that they surveyed "all families" in the city with 6 children each. If one particular birth order sequence (G B G B B G) appears in 45 families, we can use that information to estimate the total number of families in the city.

Since there are two possible genders for each birth, there are 2^6 = 64 different possible birth order sequences for a family with 6 children. However, we need to remember that half of those sequences start with a boy (B _ _ _ _ _), and half start with a girl (G _ _ _ _ _). Since the sequence given (G B G B B G) starts with a girl, only half of the total possible sequences are relevant here. Therefore, there should be 64/2 = 32 different relevant sequences if all families were surveyed.

But the study found only one of those relevant sequences (G B G B B G) in 45 families. To estimate the number of families needed for the equally likely opposite sequence (B G B B B B), we simply divide the number of families with the given sequence by the probability of having that sequence:

Number of families with B G B B B B = Families with G B G B B G / (1/32) = 45 * 32 = 54

Hence, our estimate is that there were 54 families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.
