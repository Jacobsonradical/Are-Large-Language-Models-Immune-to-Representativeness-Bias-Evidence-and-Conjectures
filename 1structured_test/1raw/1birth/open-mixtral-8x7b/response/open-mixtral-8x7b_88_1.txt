{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why: The given information only states that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G. However, it does not provide any data about other birth order patterns, including B G B B B B. Without this information, we can't accurately estimate how many families had this specific birth order pattern.
