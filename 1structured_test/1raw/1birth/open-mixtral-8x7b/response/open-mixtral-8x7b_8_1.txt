{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

The text only states that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, but it does not provide information about other possible birth order combinations, including B G B B B B. Therefore, we cannot estimate how many families had this specific birth order based on the given data.
