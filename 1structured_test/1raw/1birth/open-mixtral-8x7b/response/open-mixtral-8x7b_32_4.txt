{answer: The number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B would be statistically similar to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, so it is estimated to be around 45.}

Here's the reasoning:
1. The question states that all families of six children in a city were surveyed, and in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
2. Since the sample size is the entire population of families with six children in the city, the distribution of birth orders should reflect the inherent probability of each gender combination.
3. In this case, the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5), and the orders B G B B B B and G B G B B G have the same number of boy and girl births.
4. Therefore, it is reasonable to estimate that the number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B would be statistically similar to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, which is 45.
