{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G. Now, let's consider how many possible arrangements there are for boys (B) and girls (G) in a family of six children. There are 2^6 = 64 possible arrangements since there are two choices (boy or girl) for each of the six spots.

However, we need to account for the fact that the question asks for the "exact order" of births. This means that arrangements like B B G G B G and G B B G B G, while having the same number of boys and girls, are still different arrangements and should be counted separately. Therefore, we can treat each arrangement as a unique outcome.

Since there are 64 possible arrangements and only 1 of them is G B G B B G, the probability of any specific arrangement is 1/64. Therefore, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is estimated as follows:

Estimated number of families = Total possible arrangements * Probability of a specific arrangement
Estimated number of families = 64 * (1/64) = 1

However, this result is based on the assumption that all 64 possible arrangements are equally likely, which might not be true in reality. To account for this uncertainty, we can use a 95% confidence interval. The width of this interval depends on the sample size, and in this case, since there are 45 families, the width of the 95% confidence interval is approximately ±10.

Therefore, a more reasonable estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 1 ± 10}

But to provide a single point estimate, we can use the center of the confidence interval:

{answer: 54}

This estimate suggests that, based on the available data and assuming equal probabilities for all arrangements, it is likely that around 54 families have the birth order B G B B B B.
