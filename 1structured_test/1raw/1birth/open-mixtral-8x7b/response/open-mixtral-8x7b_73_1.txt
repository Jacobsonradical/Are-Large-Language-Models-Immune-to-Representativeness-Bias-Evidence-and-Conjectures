{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why we can't determine the answer:

The given data only tells us about the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G. There is no information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of other birth order patterns, including B G B B B B. Without knowing the total number of families and the distribution of other birth order patterns, we cannot estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
