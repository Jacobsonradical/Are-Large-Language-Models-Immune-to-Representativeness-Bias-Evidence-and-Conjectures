{answer: The number of families with the order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that boy and girl births are equally likely and independent, we can use the given data to estimate the probability of this order and then make an estimate of the number of families.

The order G B G B B G contains 6 children with 3 girls and 3 boys, which occurs in 20 (= 6!/(3!3!)) different sequences. The order G B G B B G was observed in 45 families, so the probability of a family having this order is 45/x, where x is the total number of families surveyed.

If we further assume that the probability of a family having the order B G B B B B is the same as the probability of G B G B B G, then this probability is (45/x)*(1/2)^6, where 1/2 is the probability of a boy or a girl birth.

To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can set (45/x)*(1/2)^6 = 1/y, where y is the number of families with the order B G B B B B. Solving for y, we get y = 45*2^6*x.

While we don't have enough information to determine x, if we assume that x is large (i.e., the survey is representative of all families in the city), then y will also be large. For example, if x is 1000, then y would be approximately 730.

Therefore, based on the given data and these assumptions, our estimate of the number of families with the order B G B B B B is around 730.}
