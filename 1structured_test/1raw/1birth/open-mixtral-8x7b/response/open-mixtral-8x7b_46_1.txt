{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that the gender of each child is determined randomly and independently, then the probability of a family having the birth order B G B B B B is the same as the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G. Therefore, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be expected to be similar to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, i.e., 45. But this is just an expectation, and the actual number could be different due to random variation.}
