{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. The problem states that all families of six children in a city were surveyed.
2. In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
3. Since we are interested in the opposite gender pattern for a total of six children, the pattern we are looking for is B G B B B B.
4. To estimate the number of families with this pattern, we can use the fact that there are an equal number of families with each possible birth order pattern (assuming an equal probability of having a boy or a girl).
5. There are a total of 6! (6 factorial) = 720 different birth order patterns for six children.
6. Half of these patterns (720 / 2 = 360) will start with a boy and the other half with a girl.
7. Since there are 45 families with the G B G B B G pattern, there should be a similar number of families with the B G B B B B pattern.
8. Considering the slight discrepancy due to rounding, a reasonable estimate for the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern is 360 - 45 = 54.

Hence, our estimate is 54 families.
