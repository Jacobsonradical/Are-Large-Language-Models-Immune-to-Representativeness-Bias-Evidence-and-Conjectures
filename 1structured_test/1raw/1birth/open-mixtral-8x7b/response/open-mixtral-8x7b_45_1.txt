{answer: The number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B would be statistically similar to those with the birth order G B G B B G, so it is estimated to be 45.}

Here's the reasoning:
1. The question states that they surveyed all families of six children in a city and one of the birth order patterns found was G B G B B G in 45 families.
2. Since the gender of each child is determined randomly and there are equal chances of having a boy or a girl, the birth order pattern B G B B B B should also be equally likely.
3. Therefore, it is reasonable to estimate that the number of families with the birth order pattern B G B B B B would be statistically similar to those with the pattern G B G B B G, which is 45 in this case.
