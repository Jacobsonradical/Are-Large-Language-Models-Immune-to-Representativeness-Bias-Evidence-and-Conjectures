{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. In the given data, the ratio of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G to the total number of families surveyed is 45/number of families.
2. If we assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (which is typically assumed in such problems), then the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is the same as that of G B G B B G.
3. Therefore, the ratio of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to the total number of families surveyed should also be 45/number of families.
4. Let's denote the number of families as N. Then, we have:
   (45/N = number of families with birth order G B G B B G) / (N = total number of families)
   and
   (45/N = number of families with birth order B G B B B B) / (N = total number of families)
5. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get N = 81.
6. However, since the total number of families must be a whole number, and having 81 families would imply a fractional number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, this scenario is not possible.
7. The smallest whole number larger than 81 that makes the fraction 45/N closer to a whole number is 96, for which N = 135.
8. With N = 135, we have 45/135 for G B G B B G and 45/135 for B G B B B B.
9. Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 45/135 * 135 = 45.

However, due to the assumption of equally likely birth orders, it's more appropriate to distribute the remaining 90 families (135 - 45) equally among the other possible orders. Since there are six different orders with the same probability, we can estimate that 15 families (90 / 6) have each of the other orders.

10. Adding the 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G and our estimated 15 families with the birth order B G B B B B, we get a final estimate of:
