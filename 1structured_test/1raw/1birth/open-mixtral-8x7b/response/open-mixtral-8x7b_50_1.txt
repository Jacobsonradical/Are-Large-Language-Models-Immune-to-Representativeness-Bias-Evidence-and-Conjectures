{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The number of ways to arrange the birth sequence G B G B B G for 6 children is 6! / (2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!) = 360, where 6! is the number of permutations for 6 objects, and (2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!) are the repetitions.
2. In the survey of 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, the probability of this particular sequence is 1/360.
3. Now, we want to find the sequence B G B B B B, which also has 6 children and the same number of boys and girls as the previous sequence.
4. The number of ways to arrange the sequence B G B B B B is 6! / (1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!) = 720.
5. However, since this sequence is a mirror image of G B G B B G, it has the same probability of occurrence, which is 1/360.
6. Now, to estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we divide the total number of families by the probability of the G B G B B G sequence, and then multiply it by the probability of the B G B B B B sequence: 45 * (1/360) * (360/1) = 54.

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is 54.
