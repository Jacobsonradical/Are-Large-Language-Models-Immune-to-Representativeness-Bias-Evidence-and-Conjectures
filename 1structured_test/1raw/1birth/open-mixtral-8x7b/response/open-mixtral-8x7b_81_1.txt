{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Since the ratio of boys to girls in the target birth order (B G B B B B) is 3:3, this specific birth order is equally likely as the given one (G B G B B G), which has 45 occurrences.
2. To estimate the number of families with the birth order of B G B B B B, we first need to find the probability of this occurrence.
3. Since the gender of each child is assumed to be randomly determined, the probability of having a boy or girl is always 0.5.
4. For the target birth order, we need to find the product of probabilities for having three boys (0.5*0.5*0.5) and then three girls (0.5*0.5*0.5). This equals 0.125.
5. Now, to estimate the number of families with this birth order, we multiply the total number of families surveyed (which is 45 for the given birth order) by the probability of the target birth order (0.125).
6. This gives us an estimate of 45 * 0.125 = 5.625 families. However, as we cannot have a fraction of a family, we round it to the nearest whole number, which is 6.
7. However, since the original number of families (45) is not a multiple of 8 (the sum of boys and girls in the target birth order), it is more reasonable to distribute the "extra" families across the other birth orders.
8. By distributing the extra families equally among all possible birth orders (there are 6 of them: G G B B B B, G B G B B B, G B B G B B, G B B B G B, G B B B B G, and B G B B B B), we add approximately 45 / 6 â‰ˆ 7.5 extra families per birth order.
9. Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a family, we round it to the nearest whole number, which is 8.
10. Now, adding the original families (6) and the extra families (8) together, we get an estimated total of 14 families with the target birth order.
11. So, our final estimate is 14 families with the birth order B G B B B B.

However, the question asks for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G. Using the same reasoning as above, but without rounding the final estimate, we get:

Estimate = (Number of families with the given birth order) * (Probability of the target birth order)
Estimate = 45 * 0.125
Estimate = 5.625

In this case, since we have an "extra" family in the original data, we might choose to use 5.625 as our estimate instead of rounding it. However, for simplicity and whole-number estimates, we can use the nearest round number, which is 54 (5.5 times the original number of families, 45, without rounding).
