{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G_B_G_B_B_G occurs in 45 families, we can assume that the number of boys and girls in the population is balanced. Since there are 4 boys and 2 girls in this sequence, we can infer that there are 2/6 * 6 = 2 girls and 4/6 * 6 = 4 boys in a family of 6 on average.

Now, let's estimate the number of families with the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B. Since the number of boys and girls is still balanced, we can expect a similar distribution. The only difference is that the arrangement of boys and girls is shifted by one position. Therefore, the probability of a family having the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B is the same as the probability of having G_B_G_B_B_G.

To estimate the number of families with the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B, we can simply multiply the number of families with the sequence G_B_G_B_B_G (which is 45) by the ratio of boys to girls (4:2 or 2:1). This will give us an estimate of 45 * 2 = 90 families.

However, this estimate may be higher than the actual number due to the idealized balance between boys and girls. A more conservative estimate would be to assume that the number of families with the sequence B_G_B_B_B_B is proportionally less than the number of families with the sequence G_B_G_B_B_G. In this case, we can divide the initial estimate by the factor of 90/45 = 2. This gives us an estimate of 90 / 2 = 54 families.
