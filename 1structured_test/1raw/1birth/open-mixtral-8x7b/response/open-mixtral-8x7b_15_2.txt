{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. The problem states that all families of six children in a city were surveyed.
2. In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
3. Let's calculate the probability of such an arrangement: there is a 1/2 chance for a girl (G) or a boy (B) to be born first, then a 1/2 chance again for the second birth, and so on. So, the probability of this arrangement is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.
4. Now, since there are 45 families with this arrangement, we can estimate the total number of surveyed families by multiplying the number of families with this specific arrangement by the reciprocal of its probability: 45 * 64 = 2880.
5. Next, we need to find the probability of having the arrangement B G B B B B, which also has a probability of (1/2)^6 = 1/64.
6. Finally, we estimate the number of families with this arrangement by multiplying the total number of families with the reciprocal of its probability: (2880 * 1/64) = 54.
