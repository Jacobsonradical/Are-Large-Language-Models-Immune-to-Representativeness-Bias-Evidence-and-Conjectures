{answer: The number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B would be statistically similar to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, so it is estimated to be around 45.}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The problem states that all families of six children in a city were surveyed.
2. In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
3. Since the sample size is the entire population of families with six children in the city, and there's no other information suggesting a particular pattern in gender distribution, we can assume that the sample is representative of the entire population.
4. Therefore, the number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B would be statistically similar to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, so it is estimated to be around 45.

This answer is based on the assumption that the distribution of gender in births follows a random and independent process. If there are other factors affecting gender distribution, the answer might differ.
