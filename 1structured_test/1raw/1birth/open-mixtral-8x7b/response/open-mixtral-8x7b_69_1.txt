{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The problem states that we are looking at families with six children, where the birth order is G (girl) B (boy) G ... B.
2. In this specific birth order pattern, there are 3 girls and 3 boys.
3. Now, we want to find the number of families with the birth order pattern B (boy) G (girl) B ... B.
4. This new birth order pattern also has 3 boys and 3 girls, but in a different order.
5. To estimate the number of families with this new pattern, we can use the same survey data since it should be representative for all families with six children, regardless of the birth order.
6. In the surveyed data, there were 45 families with the first birth order pattern (GBGBBG).
7. Since there are as many ways to arrange boys and girls in the new pattern (BGBBBB) as there are in the original pattern (GBGBBG), we can estimate the number of families with the new pattern to be the same as the number of families with the original pattern.
8. Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order pattern BGBBBB is 45.
9. However, the question asks for the number of families with the pattern BGBBBB, not GBGBBG. So, to avoid confusion, let's adjust our estimate by accounting for the fact that there are two ways to arrange the genders (BG or GB) and multiply our estimate by 2.
10. Thus, our final estimate is 45 * 2 = 54 families with the birth order pattern BGBBBB.
