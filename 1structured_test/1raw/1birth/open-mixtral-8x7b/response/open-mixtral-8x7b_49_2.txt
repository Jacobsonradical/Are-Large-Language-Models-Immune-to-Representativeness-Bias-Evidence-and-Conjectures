{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

The text states that the survey results are given for the specific birth order G B G B B G, but it does not provide any information about other birth order patterns, such as B G B B B B. Without this information, we cannot estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B birth order.
