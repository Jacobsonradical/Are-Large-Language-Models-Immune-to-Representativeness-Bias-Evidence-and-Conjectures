{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the ratio of number of families with the birth order G B G B B G to the total number of families surveyed is known (45 families), we can use this information to determine the total number of families surveyed. 

The pattern G B G B B G has 3 girls (G) and 3 boys (B), resulting in a ratio of 3:3 or simply 1:1. This means that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal.

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B (which has 2 girls and 4 boys), we can use the same probability. Since the probability of having a boy or a girl is 1:1, the ratio of families with the birth order B G B B B B to those with G B G B B G would be 2:3.

Let x be the total number of families surveyed. Then, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be (2/5) * x. Since 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, we can write the equation:

(2/5) * x = 45

Now, solve for x to find the total number of families surveyed:

x = 45 * (5/2)
x = 112.5

Since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 113.

Finally, to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, multiply the total number of families (113) by the ratio of families with the birth order B G B B B B (2/5):

Estimated number of families = (113) * (2/5)
Estimated number of families â‰ˆ 45.2

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is approximately 45. However, since we rounded the total number of families to 113, we should adjust our estimate as well, making it 54 families instead.
