{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, that means there are 4 births of one gender and 2 births of the other gender in that sequence. Since there are only two possible genders, this also means that the sequence B G B B B B should occur with equal frequency.

There are 7! (7 factorial) or 5040 possible sequences of births for six children, regardless of gender. Half of these sequences (2520) would have the majority of births as boys (B G B B B B), and half (2520) would have the majority as girls (G B G B B G).

However, since the question asks for the exact order of births, we need to account for the fact that there can be different arrangements of the boys and girls within the sequence. For B G B B B G, there are 6! / (6-5)! = 720 ways to arrange the boys and girls. Similarly, for B G B B B B, there are 6! / (6-6)! = 720 ways to arrange the boys.

Given that the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, we can estimate that the sequence B G B B B B, which differs by only one birth, should occur in a very similar number of families, given the large sample size. Therefore, our estimate would be around 45 * (720 / 720) or 45 families. However, to account for the slight difference in the number of ways to arrange the boys and girls in each sequence, we can adjust our estimate to be 45 * (720 / 708) or approximately 54 families.
