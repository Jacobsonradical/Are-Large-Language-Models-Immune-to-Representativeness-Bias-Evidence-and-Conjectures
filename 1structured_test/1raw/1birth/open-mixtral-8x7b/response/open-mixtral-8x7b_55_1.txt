{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is 45, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, which is 1/2 for each.

To find the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can calculate the ratio of probabilities for these two birth orders and then multiply this ratio by the given number of families with the birth order G B G B B G (45).

The ratio of probabilities for the birth orders B G B B B B and G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 : (1/2)^5
Since (1/2)^5 is common in both, we can simplify the ratio as:
(1/2) : 1

Now, to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can multiply the given number of families with the birth order G B G B B G (45) by this probability ratio:

Estimated number of families = 45 * (1/2) = 22.5

However, since we cannot have half a family, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number. In this case, we will round up to 23 or 54 (since the given number of families is already 45, which is an odd number, rounding up will give us a more accurate estimate).

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 54.
