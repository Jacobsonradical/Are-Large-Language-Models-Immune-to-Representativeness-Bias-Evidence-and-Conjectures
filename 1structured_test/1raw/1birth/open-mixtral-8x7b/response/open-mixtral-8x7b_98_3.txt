{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why:
The given information is about families with the birth order G B G B B G. Although it might give a sense that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B could be similar, there is no direct correlation between these two birth order patterns. The actual number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would depend on factors like the gender ratio at birth, which is not provided in the question.
