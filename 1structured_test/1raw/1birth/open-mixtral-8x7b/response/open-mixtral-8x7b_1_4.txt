{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be similar to those with G B G B B G, so a reasonable estimate would be around 45 families.}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the sex of the child is determined randomly and the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5) in each birth. Under this assumption, the sequence of births should be fairly evenly distributed among all possible sequences. Since there are only two sequences for all-boy or all-girl families (B B B B B B and G G G G G G), and a large number of sequences for mixed-gender families, it's reasonable to expect that the number of families in the two all-boy or all-girl sequences is approximately the same as in the G B G B B G sequence.

However, this is just an estimate, and the actual number could be different due to chance or other factors not accounted for in this simple model.
