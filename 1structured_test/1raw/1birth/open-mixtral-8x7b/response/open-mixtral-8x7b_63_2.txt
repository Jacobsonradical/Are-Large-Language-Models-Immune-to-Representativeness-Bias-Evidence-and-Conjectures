{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why: The given data is only about the birth order in 45 families with the pattern G B G B B G. There is no information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of other birth order patterns. Without this information, it's impossible to make an accurate estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
