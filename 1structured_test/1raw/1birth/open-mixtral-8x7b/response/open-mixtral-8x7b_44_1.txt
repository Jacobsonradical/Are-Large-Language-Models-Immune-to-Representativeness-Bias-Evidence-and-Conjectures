Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, this particular sequence represents a single boy being born in six births. Since there are two possible genders for each birth, the probability of this sequence is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Now, let's consider the sequence B G B B B B. This sequence also represents six births with a single girl in it. Using the same logic as above, the probability of this sequence is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Since there are an equal number of boys and girls in the population, the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should be approximately the same as those with the sequence G B G B B G. Therefore, we can estimate that there are also 45 families with the sequence B G B B B B.

However, because the question asks for the exact order of births, we need to account for the fact that the first child in the family could be a boy or a girl. This means that there should be twice as many families with the sequence B G B B B B as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is 2 * 45 = 90. However, it is important to note that this estimate may not be precise due to the limitations of the information provided. To obtain a more accurate estimate, more data and information about the families would be needed. Nonetheless, based on the given data, our estimate is 90 families, but we will provide a rounded down value as a final answer.
