{answer: The number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B would be roughly the same as those with the order G B G B B G, so it is also 45.}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The prompt tells us that the unusual birth order G B G B B G was found in 45 families.
2. Since the genders of children are presumably determined randomly, we would expect a similar number of families with the reverse order, B G B B B G.
3. However, since the last child in the B G B B B B case is a boy, and boys cannot be born in this position for the G B G B B G case, these cases are not exactly symmetrical.
4. Nonetheless, given the randomness of gender determination, it is reasonable to estimate that the number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B would be roughly the same.
5. Therefore, our estimate is also 45 families for the birth order B G B B B B.

Please note that this is an estimate based on the assumption of randomness. The actual number could be different due to chance or other factors.
