{answer: 54}

Here's the logic behind this:

1. We know that in 45 families, the order of births was G B G B B G.
2. To find out how many families have the order B G B B B G, we just need to switch the first two children's genders in those families.
3. Since there are 45 families with the G B G B B G pattern, there would be an equal number of families with the B G B B B G pattern after switching the first two children's genders.
4. So, our estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B would be 45.
5. However, we also need to consider families that have the order B B G B B B, which can be transformed into B G B B B B by switching the first two children's positions without changing their genders.
6. The number of families with the order B B G B B B should be the same as the number of families with the order G G B B B G, but we weren't given this information.
7. As a reasonable estimate, let's assume that the number of families with the order G G B B B G is also 45 (since it's a city-wide survey and we don't have any reason to believe one pattern is more common than the other).
8. In this case, half of those families (45 / 2 = 22.5) would switch the positions of their first two children to create the B G B B B B pattern. Since we cannot have half a family, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 23.
9. Adding our previous estimate of 45 families with the B G B B B G pattern and the new estimate of 23 families with the B G B B B B pattern after switching genders, we get a total estimate of 68 families.
10. However, this number is greater than the total number of families surveyed, which means our estimate was too high. To adjust for this, let's assume that the initial distribution of patterns G B G B B G and B B G B B B were not equal.
11. If we reduce the number of families with the G B G B B G pattern by 10 (from 45 to 35) and increase the number of families with the B B G B B B pattern by 10 (from an assumed 45 to 55), then our estimates become more balanced.
12. With these adjusted numbers, we would have 35 families with the B G B B B G pattern and 27.5 families with the B G B B B B pattern after switching genders. Again, since we cannot have half a family, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 28.
13. Adding our adjusted estimates together, we get a total of 63 families. However, this number is still slightly higher than the total number of families surveyed.
14. To further adjust our estimates, let's assume that the actual distribution of patterns G B G B B G and B B G B B B was even closer than our initial assumption.
15. If we reduce the number of families with the G B G B B G pattern by 5 more (from 35 to 30) and increase the number of families with the B B G B B B pattern by 5 (from an assumed 55 to 60), then our estimates become even more balanced.
16. With these new adjusted numbers, we would have 30 families with the B G B B B G pattern and 30 families with the B G B B B B pattern after switching genders.
17. Adding our final adjusted estimates together, we get a total of 60 families. However, we need to account for the possibility that some of these families could have the B B G B B B pattern, which would become B G B B B B after switching the first two children's positions without changing their genders.
