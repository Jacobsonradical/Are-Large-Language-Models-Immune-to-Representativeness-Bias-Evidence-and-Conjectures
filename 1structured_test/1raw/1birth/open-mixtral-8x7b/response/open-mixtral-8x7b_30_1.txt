{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that there are 45 families with the birth order of G B G B B G.

Let's analyze this pattern and compare it to the desired pattern (B G B B B B). Both patterns have three boys (B) and three girls (G), but their order is different.

To convert the G B G B B G pattern into the B G B B B B pattern, we need to swap the first girl (G) with a boy (B) in the second position.

Since there are 45 families with the G B G B B G pattern, and we're looking for the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern, we can estimate this by calculating how many different ways we can choose a family to make the switch.

There are six children in each family, so the probability of choosing a family with the G B G B B G pattern and making the necessary switch is 1/6.

To find the estimated number of families with the B G B B B B pattern, we multiply the total number of families (which is not given but assumed to be large enough for statistical significance) by the probability of choosing a family with the G B G B B G pattern and making the switch:

Estimated families = (total families) * (probability of switch)
Estimated families = (total families) * (1/6)

We don't know the total number of families surveyed, but we can still express our answer in terms of it:

{answer: (total families) * (1/6)}.

However, if we assume that the number of families is divisible by 6 (which is reasonable since family sizes are usually even), we can simplify this further. Let's say the total number of families is 324 (the smallest multiple of 6 greater than 45). Then our answer would be:

Estimated families = (324) * (1/6) = 54

So, our estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B would be 54 if the total number of families is a multiple of 6.
