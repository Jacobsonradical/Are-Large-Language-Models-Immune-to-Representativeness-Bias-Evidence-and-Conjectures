{answer: The number of families with the order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why: While we know the number of families with the order G B G B B G, the information given doesn't provide enough data about the total number of families surveyed or the number of families with other birth order patterns. Without knowing the total number of families surveyed, we can't accurately estimate the number of families with a specific birth order pattern like B G B B B B.
