{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be similar to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, so we can estimate 45 families also had this birth order.}

Note: This estimate is based on the assumption that the genders of children in each family are determined randomly and are independent of each other. This is a simplification, as in reality, factors such as genetics and age of the parents can influence the gender of a child.
