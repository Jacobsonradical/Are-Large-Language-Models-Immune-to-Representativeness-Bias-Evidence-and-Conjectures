{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that boy/girl births are equally likely and independent, we can use the given data to estimate the probability of the birth order B G B B B G and then use that to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

The probability of the birth order B G B B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64. If there are 45 families with this birth order, then the expected number of families with any particular birth order is 45/64. Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is (1/64) * 45 â‰ˆ 0.703125.

Please note that this is only an estimate based on the assumptions of equal likelihood and independence of boy/girl births.}
