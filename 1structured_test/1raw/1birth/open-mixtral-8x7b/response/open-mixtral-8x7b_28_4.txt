{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The problem states that all families of six children in a city were surveyed.
2. In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
3. There are 7! (7 factorial) = 5,040 different orders in which boys and girls can be born in a family of six children.
4. Half of these orders (5,040 / 2 = 2,520) will start with a girl, and the other half will start with a boy.
5. The order we are looking for (B G B B B B) is one of the 2,520 orders that start with a boy.
6. Since the sample of 45 families with the order G B G B B G is representative of the city's families, we can estimate that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is also 45.
7. However, we are interested in the number of families with the order B G B B B B as a proportion of the total number of families surveyed.
8. So far, we have 45 families with the order G B G B B G and another 45 families with the order B G B B B B, making it a total of 90 families counted.
9. Since the problem states that all families of six children in a city were surveyed, and we initially assumed there were N families, we can write an equation: N = 45 * 2! + 45 * 2! + (N - 90).
10. Simplifying the equation gives us N = 180, meaning there are 180 families in total.
11. We have already counted 45 families with the order B G B B B B, so our estimate for the number of families with this order is 45.

Hence, our answer is {answer: 54}.
