{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that boy and girl births are equally likely and independent, we can estimate the number of families with this birth order using the same probability as for the G B G B B G order. This would give us an estimate of approximately 45 families with the B G B B B B birth order.}
