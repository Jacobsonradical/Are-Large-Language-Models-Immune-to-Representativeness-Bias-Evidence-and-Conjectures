{answer: The number of families with the order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why:
The given data only tells us the number of families with the order G B G B B G, but it doesn't provide any information about other birth order patterns, including B G B B B B. Without this specific data, it is impossible to make an estimate or draw any conclusions about the number of families with this particular birth order pattern.
