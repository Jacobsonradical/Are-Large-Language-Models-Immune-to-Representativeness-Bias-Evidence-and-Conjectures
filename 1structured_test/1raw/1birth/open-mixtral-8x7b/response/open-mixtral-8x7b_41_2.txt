{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the given information. However, if we assume that the gender of each child is determined randomly and independently, we can use the given data to estimate the probability of a family having the birth order B G B B B G, and then calculate the expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Let's first calculate the probability of a family having the birth order G B G B B G. There are 6! (720) possible orders of birth for six children. The number of orders with the pattern G B G B B G is 6! / (2! \* 1! \* 1! \* 1! \* 1! \* 1!) = 360. Since the gender of each child is determined randomly and independently, the probability of a family having this pattern is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Now, assuming that the gender of each child is determined randomly and independently, the probability of a family having the pattern B G B B B B is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64. Therefore, the expected number of families with this pattern is (1/64) \* number of families surveyed = 45.

Therefore, if the gender of each child is determined randomly and independently, we can estimate that about 45 families would have the birth order B G B B B B.}
