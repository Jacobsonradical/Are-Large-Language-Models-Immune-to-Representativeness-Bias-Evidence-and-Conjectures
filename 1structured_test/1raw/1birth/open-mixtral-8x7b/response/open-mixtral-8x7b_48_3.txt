{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the ratio of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G to the total number of families surveyed is known (45 families), we can use this information to find the total number of families surveyed. 

The ratio of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G to the total number of families surveyed is 1 : 3. This is because there are 6 positions for births in the sequence, and in the G B G B B G order, 1 position is occupied by a girl, leaving 3 positions to be occupied by boys or girls in any combination.

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is 132 (since 132 is a multiple of 3). This assumption is based on the given information that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G. 

Now, with this assumption, let's calculate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B G. The ratio of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B G to the total number of families surveyed is also 1 : 3. So, if we divide the total number of families surveyed (132) by 3, we get 44. Since we are looking for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B G, we need to add 1 to this value (because the first family in the sequence would have this birth order).

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 44 + 1 = 54.
