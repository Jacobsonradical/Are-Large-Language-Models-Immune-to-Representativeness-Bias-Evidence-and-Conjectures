{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, this means that there are 4 boy-births and 2 girl-births in those families. Since the total number of children in each family is 6, there must be 2 more boys in the families with this sequence.

Now, let's consider a different sequence - B G B B B B. This sequence has 3 boy-births and 3 girl-births. However, we know that there are more than 3 boy-births in the surveyed families because the sequence G B G B B G also exists. This implies that the sequence B G B B B B must also be present among the families surveyed.

Since there are 6 children in each family, having 3 boy-births and 3 girl-births is the only way to balance the excess boys from the G B G B B G sequence. Now, let's calculate the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B:

The probability of having the sequence B G B B B B is equal to the probability of having the sequence G B G B B G, as both have the same number of boy-births and girl-births (but in reverse order). Since the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, there must be an equal number of families with the sequence B G B B B B.

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births is B G B B B B is 45. However, since some of these families may have been double-counted due to overlapping sequences (e.g., a family with the sequence G B G B B G B), we need to adjust our estimate.

We know that 45 families have at least 4 boy-births (the G B G B B G sequence). For the remaining 2 boy-births, they can be placed either before or after the existing 4 boy-births, creating 3 possibilities (B G B G B G B, G B B G B B G, or G B G B B G B). So, for each family with the G B G B B G sequence, there are 2 additional families with the B G B B B B sequence (resulting from the placement of the remaining 2 boy-births).

Thus, our adjusted estimate for the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is 45 * 2 = 90. However, we must account for the overlap between sequences. We can approximate this overlap by assuming that, on average, there is a 50% overlap between the sequences G B G B B G and B G B B B B. This means that each family with the sequence G B G B B G is counted twice in our initial estimate of 90 families. To correct for this double-counting, we divide the estimate by 2, resulting in an estimated 45 families with the sequence B G B B B B.
