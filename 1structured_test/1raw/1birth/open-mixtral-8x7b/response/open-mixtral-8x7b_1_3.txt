{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if the gender of each child is determined randomly and independently, then the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is the same as the birth order G B G B B G. Therefore, it is plausible to estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also around 45.}
