{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We are looking for the number of families that have the birth order B G B B B B. Since the question states that the survey was conducted on all families with six children in the city, we can use the information about the frequency of the G B G B B G order to estimate the frequency of the desired birth order.

In the provided data, the birth order G B G B B G appears in 45 families. Since the genders are alternating, the number of boy-girl changes in this sequence is 5 (from Girl to Boy). If we want to find the birth order with six boys (B G B B B B), we need to change the initial girl in the sequence to a boy. By doing this, we create one additional boy-girl change.

Since there are 5 boy-girl changes in the original sequence, and we added 1 more, the new sequence will have 6 boy-girl changes. This means that each child in the new sequence is a different gender than its counterpart in the original sequence.

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the same frequency of the original sequence by applying the same ratio. Since we added 1 boy-girl change, we can divide the original frequency by the initial number of boy-girl changes and multiply it by the number of boy-girl changes in the new sequence:

45 / 5 * 6 = 54

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 54.
