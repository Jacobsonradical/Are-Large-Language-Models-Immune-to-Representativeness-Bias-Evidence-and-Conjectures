{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why: The given data only tells us the number of families with a specific birth order pattern (G B G B B G). However, it does not provide any information about other birth order patterns, such as B G B B B B. Without this information, we can't estimate how many families might have had this particular birth order pattern.
