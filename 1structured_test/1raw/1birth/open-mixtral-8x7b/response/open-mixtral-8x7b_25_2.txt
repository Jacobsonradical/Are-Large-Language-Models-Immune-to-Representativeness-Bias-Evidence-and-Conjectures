{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why: While we know the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, the information given doesn't provide enough data to make any assumptions or draw conclusions about the distribution of families with other birth order patterns, such as B G B B B B. Additional information about the overall distribution of birth orders in the city would be needed to estimate the number of families with this particular birth order pattern.
