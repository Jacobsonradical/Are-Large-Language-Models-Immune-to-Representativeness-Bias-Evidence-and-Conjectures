{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Since all families of six children were surveyed, we can use the information about the number of families with the G B G B B G pattern to estimate the total number of families surveyed.
2. Let's assume that the gender of each child is determined randomly and there is a 50% chance of having a boy or a girl.
3. To find the total number of possible birth order combinations for six children, we can use 2 to the power of 6 (since there are two possibilities, boy or girl, for each birth). This gives us 64 different combinations.
4. Now, we are given that 45 families have the G B G B B G pattern. This means that there are 19 other patterns besides G B G B B G out of the 64 possible combinations.
5. To find the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern, we can subtract the number of families with the G B G B B G pattern and the 19 other patterns from the total number of families surveyed.
6. Since we assume an equal probability for each pattern, we can divide the total number of combinations (64) by the number of patterns we are subtracting (20) to estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern.
7. So, 64/20 ≈ 3.2, and since the number of families must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3.
8. Finally, multiply this estimate by the number of families with the G B G B B G pattern (45) to get an estimate for the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern: 3 * 45 = 135.

However, this estimate may be too high because it assumes that all patterns, including those that are less likely (like B B B B B B or G G G G G G), are represented in the survey. To adjust for this, we can calculate the probability of having at least one instance of the G B G B B G or B G B B B B pattern in a sample of six children and use that to estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern.

The probability of having at least one instance of either pattern is:

P(at least one instance) = 1 - P(no instances)

P(no instances) = (1/2)^6 * 2! + (1/2)^6 * 2!

P(at least one instance) ≈ 0.96875

This probability suggests that almost all families will have at least one instance of either pattern. Given that, a more realistic estimate would be to assume that the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern is proportional to the number of families with the G B G B B G pattern:

Estimated number of families with the B G B B B B pattern = (45/135) * 45 ≈ 54

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern is approximately 54.
