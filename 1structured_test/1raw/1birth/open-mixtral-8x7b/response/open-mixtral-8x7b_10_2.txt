{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. The problem states that all families of six children in a city were surveyed.
2. In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
3. Now, we want to find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
4. To calculate this, we need to determine how many different arrangements are possible for having 3 girls and 3 boys among 6 children, which can be calculated using the formula for permutations (n! / (n-k)!), where n is the total number of children and k is the number of girls or boys.
5. In this case, n = 6 and k = 3, so the formula becomes 6! / (6-3)! = 720 / 6 = 120.
6. However, we need to account for the fact that there are two distinct genders, so we divide the total number of permutations by 2 to avoid double-counting (since swapping the positions of girls or boys doesn't change the overall gender distribution): 120 / 2 = 60.
7. Since the total number of families surveyed is equal to the sum of all possible unique gender distributions, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by subtracting the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G from half the total number of permutations: 60 - 45 = 15.
8. However, this answer represents only one half of the possible orders (either B G or G B), so we multiply it by 2 to account for both possibilities: 15 * 2 = 30.

The answer above is based on assuming that the order G B G B B G is different from B G B B B G. If you consider them the same, then the answer would be 15 instead of 30.
