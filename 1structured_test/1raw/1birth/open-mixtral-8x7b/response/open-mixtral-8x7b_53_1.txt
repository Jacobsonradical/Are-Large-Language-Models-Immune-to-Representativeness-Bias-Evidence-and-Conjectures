{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that the gender of each child is determined randomly and independently, we can estimate the probability of this birth order and use it to make a prediction. The probability of having a boy or a girl at each birth is 0.5, so the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/64. If there are a total of 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, then we would expect about (45/64) families to have the birth order B G B B B B, on average. Of course, the actual number could be different due to chance.}
