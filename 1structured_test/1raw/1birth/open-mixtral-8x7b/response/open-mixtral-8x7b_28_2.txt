{answer: The number of families with the order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given.}

Here's why we can't determine the exact number: The given data only tells us about the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G. There is no information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of other birth order patterns, including B G B B B B. Without this information, we can't accurately estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern.
