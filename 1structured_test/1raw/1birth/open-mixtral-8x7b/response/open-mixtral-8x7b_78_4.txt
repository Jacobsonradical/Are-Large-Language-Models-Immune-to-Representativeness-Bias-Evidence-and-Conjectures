{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be accurately estimated from the information provided about families with the birth order G B G B B G.}

Here's why: The information given in the question is about a specific birth order pattern, G B G B B G. While it might be tempting to use this information to make assumptions about the opposite pattern (B G B B B B), there is no direct correlation between the two. The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B could be significantly different, and we cannot estimate it accurately without more information.
