{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Since the gender of each child can be either boy (B) or girl (G), there are 2^6 = 64 different possible birth order combinations for families with six children.
2. The survey result shows that one specific order, G B G B B G, was found in 45 families.
3. To estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B order, we can use the principle of indifference, assuming that all 64 possible orders are equally likely.
4. Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B order by taking the ratio of the number of desired orders to the total number of possible orders, and then multiplying this ratio by the number of families surveyed (which is 45 times the ratio).
5. So, the estimate is (1/64) * 64 * 45 = 54 families.
