{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that the genders of the children are determined randomly and independently, we can calculate the probability of this birth order and use it to make an estimate. The probability of a boy or a girl being born is 0.5, so the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64. If we assume that the number of families surveyed is large enough and that the genders of the children are determined randomly, we would expect the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to be roughly 45/64, or about 0.703125 times the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.}
