{answer: 54}

Here's the logic behind this:

1. The problem states that they surveyed all families in the city with six children.
2. In 45 of these families, the birth order was G B G B B G.
3. Since there are only two possibilities for each birth (boy or girl), the number of different orders for six children is 2^6 = 64.
4. However, we need to subtract 1 from this number because the order B B B B B B is the same as G B G B G B (both would count as the same sequence).
5. So, there are 63 - 1 = 62 different orders of birth for six children.
6. Given that the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, we can estimate the number of occurrences of the sequence B G B B B B by assuming that the distribution of families among the different orders is relatively even.
7. Therefore, we can estimate that the sequence B G B B B B occurs in approximately (45 / (62 - 1)) * (62 - 1) = 45 / 61 * 62 ≈ 45 * 1.0164 = 45.62 ≈ 54 families.
