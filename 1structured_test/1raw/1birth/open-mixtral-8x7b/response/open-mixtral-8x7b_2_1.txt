{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

The problem statement tells us that the survey includes all families of six children in the city. To estimate the number of families with a specific birth order, such as B G B B B B, we can use the fact that there are an equal number of families with each possible birth order arrangement for boys and girls.

There are $\frac{6!}{4!2!} = 15$ distinct ways to arrange the birth order with 4 boys and 2 girls (e.g., B B B B G G, B B B G B G, etc.). Since the survey includes all families with six children, the number of families with a specific birth order (in this case, B G B B B B) should be approximately the same as for any other birth order arrangement.

So, to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can divide the total number of families surveyed (45 for each family with the G B G B B G order) by the number of distinct birth order arrangements (15) and round up to the nearest whole number:

45 / 15 â‰ˆ 3

However, since we rounded down to get 15, we need to adjust our estimate by adding one additional family to account for the possibility of a higher distribution of families with the specific birth order:

Estimate = 3 + 1 = 4

However, since we know that the total number of families surveyed is a multiple of 15 (30, 45, 60, etc.), we should adjust our estimate to be a multiple of 15 as well. The closest multiple of 15 that is greater than our initial estimate is 54.

Therefore, our estimated number of families surveyed with the exact order of births B G B B B B is {answer: 54}.
