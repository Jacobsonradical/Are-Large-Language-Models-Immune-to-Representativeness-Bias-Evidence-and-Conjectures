{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the ratio of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G to the total number of families surveyed is known (45 families), we can use this information to find the total number of families surveyed. 

Let's denote the total number of families as N. We are looking for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, which is also 1/2 of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

The ratio of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G to the total number of families N can be written as:

45 / N = 1 / 2 * k

where k is a constant that adjusts for the different sizes of the two groups. Since the order B G B B B B has exactly half as many girls as the order G B G B B G, we can use k = 2 to make the numbers of each group equal. This gives us:

45 / N = 1 / 4

Solving for N, we get:

N = 45 * 4 = 180

So, the total number of families surveyed is 180. Now we can find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, which is 1/2 of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G:

Number of families with the birth order B G B B B B = (1/2) * 45 = 22.5

However, since we cannot have half a family, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number, which is 23. But, since there are only 180 families in total, and we have already accounted for 45 of them, we need to adjust our estimate to account for this difference:

Estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B = 23 - (45 - 180) = 54

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is 54.
