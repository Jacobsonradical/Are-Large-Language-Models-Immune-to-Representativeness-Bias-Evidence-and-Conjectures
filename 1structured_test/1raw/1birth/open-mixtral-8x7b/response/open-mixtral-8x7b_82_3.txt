{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, so it's 50/50 for each birth. So, the probability of having the sequence G-B (girl first, boy second) is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

In the given sequence G-B-G-B-B-G, there are 3 sequences of G-B. The probability of this sequence is therefore (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

The sequence we're interested in, B-G-B-B-B-B, also has a probability of (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Since the question states that this survey was conducted for all families in the city, we can assume that the sample size is large enough to apply the law of large numbers. This means that the ratio of the occurrences of the two sequences should be approximately equal to their probabilities.

So, if the sequence G-B-G-B-B-G occurred 45 times, then the sequence B-G-B-B-B-B should have occurred approximately 45 * (0.015625 / 0.25) = 54 times.
