{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be similar to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, so we can estimate 45 families also had this birth order.}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The prompt tells us that all families of six children in a city were surveyed, and the exact order of births of boys (B) and girls (G) was G B G B B G in 45 families.
2. Since the survey covers all families with six children, it is likely that the distribution of boy/girl birth orders is similar across families.
3. Therefore, we can estimate that a comparable number of families have the exact birth order B G B B B B.
4. Note that this is an estimate and the actual number could be different, depending on various factors. However, without more information, this estimate is the best answer we can provide.
