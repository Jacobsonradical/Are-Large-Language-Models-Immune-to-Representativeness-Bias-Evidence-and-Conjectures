{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the given information.}

Here's why:
The problem states that the *number* of families with a specific birth order was given, but it does not provide any information about the *ratio* or *probability* of different gender combinations. Without knowing the probability of having a boy or a girl, we cannot estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

However, if we assume that the gender of each child is determined randomly and there is a 50% chance of having a boy or a girl, then we could calculate the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B as 1/64. But, this would still not provide an estimate of the number of families, as we don't have enough information about the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of birth orders among them.
