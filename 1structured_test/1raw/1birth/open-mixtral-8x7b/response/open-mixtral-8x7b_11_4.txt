{answer: The number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B would be statistically similar to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, so it is estimated to be around 45.}

Here's the reasoning:
1. The problem states that all families of six children in a city were surveyed.
2. In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
3. The gender of the first child does not affect the probability of subsequent births.
4. Therefore, the probability of a boy being born is the same as that of a girl, i.e., 0.5.
5. The birth order B G B B B B is as likely as the given birth order since the probabilities of boys and girls are equal.
6. Hence, it is estimated that there are also around 45 families with the birth order B G B B B B.
