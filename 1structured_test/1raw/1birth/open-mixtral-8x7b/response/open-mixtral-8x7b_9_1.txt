{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that boy and girl births are equally likely and independent, then we can use the previous data to estimate this number. Since the birth order G B G B B G is equivalent to B G B B G B (just swap the first two children), we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is about 45/2 = 22.5. But since the number of families must be a whole number, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number. Thus, our estimate is 23 families.}
