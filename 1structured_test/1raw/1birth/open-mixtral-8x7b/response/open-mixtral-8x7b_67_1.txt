{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, this particular sequence represents a pattern where a boy is born after two girls. This pattern can be seen as a single event. 

Now, let's consider the desired sequence, which is B G B B B B, where a boy is born after one girl. This pattern is different from the original sequence and should be less likely to occur since it has one more girl-boy switch. 

Since there are six births, there are five possible positions for the switch from girl to boy. Each additional girl-boy switch decreases the likelihood of the sequence by 1/6 because the switch can happen in any of the five positions, not just at the end. 

So, the probability of the sequence B G B B B B compared to G B G B B G is 1/6, and the number of families with the desired sequence would be 45 * (1/6) = 54 families.
