{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that the genders of children are determined randomly and independently, then we can estimate the probability of a family having the birth order B G B B B B as 1/64. Using this probability, we can estimate the number of families with this birth order to be approximately (1/64) * (number of families surveyed) = (1/64) * 45 = 0.703125. But since we cannot have a fraction of a family, we would round this to the nearest whole number. Therefore, our estimate would be 1 family with the birth order B G B B B B.}
