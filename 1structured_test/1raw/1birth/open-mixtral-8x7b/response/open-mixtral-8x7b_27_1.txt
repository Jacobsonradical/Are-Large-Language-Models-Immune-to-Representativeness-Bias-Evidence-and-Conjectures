{answer: The number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided. However, if we assume that the gender of each child is determined randomly and independently, we can use the given data to estimate this number.

The probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64. Therefore, the number of families with this specific birth order is 45.

Now, let's calculate the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B, which is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64. Since the total number of possible birth orders for six children is 2^6 = 64, and they are all equally likely, the probability of any specific birth order is 1/64.

Thus, under the assumption of random and independent gender determination, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is approximately the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, which is 45. However, this is only an estimate and might not reflect the actual number due to randomness and sampling variability.}
