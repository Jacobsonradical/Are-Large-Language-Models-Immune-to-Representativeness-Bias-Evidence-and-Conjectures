{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, that means there are 4 boys and 2 girls in those families, with the specific arrangement of G BGBBG.

Now let's consider families with the sequence B G B B B B. This sequence represents 5 boys and 1 girl (BGBBBB).

Since there are 6 children in both cases, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the BGBBBB sequence based on the given data.

To do this, we can calculate the ratio of families between these two sequences by comparing the number of arrangements for each sequence.

For the G BGBBG sequence, there are 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15 arrangements (divided by 2! and 4! because two girls and four boys are identical within their groups).

Similarly, for the BGBBBB sequence, there are 6! / (5!) = 6 arrangements (divided by 5! because all 5 boys are identical).

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the BGBBBB sequence by multiplying the number of observed families (45) by the ratio of arrangements of the BGBBBB sequence to the G BGBBG sequence:

Estimated families = Observed families * (arrangements of BGBBBB sequence) / (arrangements of G BGBBG sequence)
Estimated families = 45 * (6) / (15)
Estimated families = 45 * (2)
Estimated families = 90 / 2
Estimated families = 54

So our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 54.
