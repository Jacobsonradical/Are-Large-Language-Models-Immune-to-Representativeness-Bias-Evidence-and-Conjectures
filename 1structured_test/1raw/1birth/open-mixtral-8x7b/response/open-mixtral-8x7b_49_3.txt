{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why: The information given only tells us about the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G. We don't have any information about the number of families with other birth orders, including B G B B B B. Therefore, we can't estimate the number of families with this specific birth order based on the information provided.
