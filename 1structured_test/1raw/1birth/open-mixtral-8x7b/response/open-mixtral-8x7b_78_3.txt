{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why we can't determine the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

The given data only tells us the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G. There is no information about the distribution of other birth orders, such as B G B B B B, in the surveyed families. Without this specific information, it is impossible to make an accurate estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
