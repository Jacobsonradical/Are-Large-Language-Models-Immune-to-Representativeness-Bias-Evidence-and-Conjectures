{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the given information.}

Here's why: The information provided only tells us about the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G. It does not give any information about the distribution of families with other birth orders, including B G B B B B. Therefore, we cannot estimate the number of families with this specific birth order based on the given data.
