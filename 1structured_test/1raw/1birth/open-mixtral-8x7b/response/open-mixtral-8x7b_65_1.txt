{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that boy/girl births are equally likely and independent, then the probability of this birth order is the same as for G B G B B G, or 1/64. Therefore, a rough estimate of the number of families with this birth order would be 45/64.}
