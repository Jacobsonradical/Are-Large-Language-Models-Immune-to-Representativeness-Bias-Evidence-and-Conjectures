{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Let's look at the number of ways to arrange BBs and Gs in this sequence. There are 6 positions, and we need to place 3 BBs and 3 Gs. This is a problem of permutations with repetitions. The formula for this type of problem is:

Permutations with repetitions = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)

where n is the total number of items, n1, n2, ..., nk are the counts of each individual item, and ! denotes factorial.

So, in this case, n = 6, n1 = 3 (BBs), n2 = 3 (Gs):

Permutations with repetitions = 6! / (3! * 3!) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 20

Now, since there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, and each sequence has 20 possibilities with BBs and Gs interchanged, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B as:

45 * (20 / 2) = 45 * 10 = 450 / 10 = 54

Hence, our estimate is that 54 families surveyed had the exact order of births B G B B B B.
