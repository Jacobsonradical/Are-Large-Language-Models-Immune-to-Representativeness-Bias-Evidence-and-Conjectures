{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We can use the concept of probability and expected frequencies to estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern. If all orders of births were equally likely, then the probability of any specific order would be 1/64 (since there are 2^6 = 64 possible orders for six children, and only 1 of them is B G B B B B). 

Since the text states that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can find the estimated number of families for any other order by multiplying the probability of that order by 45.

So, for the order B G B B B B, the estimated number of families would be:

Estimated families = Probability(B G B B B B) × Observed families (G B G B B G)
Estimated families = (1/64) × 45 ≈ 54.69

Since it is not possible to have a fraction of a family, we'll round the number to the nearest whole family, which is 54.
