{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

The problem statement implies that the gender of each child is determined randomly and that there are equal chances of having a boy or a girl. So, the probability of having a boy or a girl at any birth is always 0.5.

The order G B G B B G has 3 girls and 3 boys, and we know that this sequence occurred in 45 families. To find the probability of this sequence, we multiply the probabilities of each event:

Probability of G B G B B G = (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.015625

Now, let's find the sequence B G B B B B. This sequence also has 3 girls and 3 boys, but in a different order. The probability of this sequence is the same:

Probability of B G B B B B = (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.015625

To estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, divide the total number of families surveyed by the probability of the sequence:

Number of families = 45 / 0.015625 = 2872

However, we are interested in the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B among the families surveyed, not among the total population. Since the probabilities are the same for both sequences, the ratio of families with each sequence should also be 1:1.

Hence, the estimate of families with the sequence B G B B B B among the surveyed families is:

{answer: 45 * (1/2) = 54}
