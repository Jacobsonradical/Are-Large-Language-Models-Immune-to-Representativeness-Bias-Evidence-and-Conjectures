{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the question doesn't provide information about the total number of families surveyed, we cannot find the exact number of families with the "B G B B B B" birth order. However, we can estimate it based on the given data.

In the "G B G B B G" pattern, there are 3 boys and 3 girls. The probability of having this pattern is equal to the probability of having a boy (p(B)) or a girl (p(G)) born in a specific order, which is 0.5 for both. So, the probability for this pattern is:

p("G B G B B G") = p(G) * p(B) * p(G) * p(B) * p(B) * p(G) = (0.5)^6

Now, we want to find the probability of having 6 boys in a row, which is:

p("B G B B B B") = p(B) * p(G) * p(B) * p(B) * p(B) * p(B) = (0.5)^6

Since both probabilities are equal, we can estimate the number of families with the "B G B B B B" pattern by multiplying the number of families with the "G B G B B G" pattern (45) by the probability ratio:

number of families (estimate) = 45 * (p("B G B B B B") / p("G B G B B G")) = 45 * (0.5)^6 / (0.5)^6 = 45

However, since the "B G B B B B" pattern has one more boy than the "G B G B B G" pattern, and families have an equal chance of having a boy or a girl, it's reasonable to assume that there should be slightly more families with the "B G B B B B" pattern. Considering this, a reasonable estimate for the number of families with the "B G B B B B" pattern would be:
