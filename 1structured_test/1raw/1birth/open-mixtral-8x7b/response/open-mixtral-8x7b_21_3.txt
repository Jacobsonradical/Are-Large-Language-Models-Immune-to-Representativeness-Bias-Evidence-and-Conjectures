{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. In the given data, the ratio of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G to the total number of families surveyed is 45/total number of families.
2. This ratio can be also interpreted as the probability of a family having the birth order G B G B B G.
3. Now, let's consider the complementary probability, which is the probability that a family has the birth order B G B B B B. Since there are only two possible outcomes (G B G B B G or B G B B B B) for a family with six children, the complementary probability is equal to 1 minus the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G.
4. Therefore, the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is 1 - (45/total number of families).
5. We are looking for an estimate of the total number of families surveyed such that this probability results in a whole number (as we cannot have a fraction of a family). By trying different numbers, we find that when the total number of families is 99, the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is 54/99, which simplifies to 2/3. This is a reasonable estimate since it is close to 1 (meaning it is highly probable) but not equal to 1 (meaning it is not certain).
6. So our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 54.
