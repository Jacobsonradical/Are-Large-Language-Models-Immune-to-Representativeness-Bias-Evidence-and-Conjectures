{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why:
The given data indicates the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, but it does not provide any information about the distribution of other birth orders, such as B G B B B B. Without this data, we cannot estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
