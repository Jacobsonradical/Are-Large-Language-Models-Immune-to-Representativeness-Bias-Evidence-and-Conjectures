{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The problem states that all families of six children in a city were surveyed.
2. In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
3. Let's denote the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as x.
4. Since the newborns are either a boy or a girl, for every girl born, the distribution of subsequent genders remains the same.
5. Therefore, for each G B G B B G family, there should be an equal number of B G B B B B families, because swapping the first and second children (the girl and the boy) in the former results in the latter.
6. Thus, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be equal to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, except for the first family, which can't have its children swapped.
7. Therefore, the estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 45 * 6 / 5 + 1 = 54. The "+1" is added because the estimation method may not account for the initial G B G B B G family accurately.
