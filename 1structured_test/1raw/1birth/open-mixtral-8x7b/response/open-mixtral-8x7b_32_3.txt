{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. The number of ways to arrange the sequence G B G B B G for 6 children, with regard to birth order, is 6! / (2! * 1!) = 180, since there are two instances of 'G' and one instance of 'B'.
2. The total number of possible sequences for 6 children, ignoring gender, is 6! = 720.
3. Therefore, the probability of getting the sequence G B G B B G in a family with 6 children is 180/720 = 1/4.
4. Since the question states that this particular sequence was found in 45 families, we can estimate the number of families surveyed by multiplying 45 by 4 (because the probability of the sequence B G B B B B is also 1/4).
5. So, our estimate is 45 * 4 = 180 families.
6. However, since there are only two genders, the number of families should be even. Thus, we adjust our estimate to 54 families.
