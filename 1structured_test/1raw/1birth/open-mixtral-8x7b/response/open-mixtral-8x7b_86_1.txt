{answer: The number of families with the order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why: The given information tells us about the number of families with a specific birth order (G B G B B G), but it doesn't provide any details about the number of families with other birth orders, such as B G B B B B. To estimate the number of families with this birth order, we would need information specific to that order, which isn't provided in the question.
