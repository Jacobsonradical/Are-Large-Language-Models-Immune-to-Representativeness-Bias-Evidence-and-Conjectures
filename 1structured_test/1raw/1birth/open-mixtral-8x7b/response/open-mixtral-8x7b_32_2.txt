{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that the gender of each child is determined randomly and independently, we can estimate the probability of this birth order and use it to make an educated guess.

The probability of having a boy or a girl at each birth is 0.5. Therefore, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64.

If we further assume that all birth orders are equally likely, then the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be about 1/64 of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, i.e., about 45 / 64 â‰ˆ 0.7.

However, this is only an estimate and may not reflect the actual number of families in the survey.}
