{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The problem states that we are looking at families with six children, where the order of births is G (girl) B (boy) G ... etc.
2. In this specific order (G B G B B G), there are 3 girls and 3 boys, so the gender of the firstborn child does not affect the probability of the given birth order.
3. Now, let's look at the order B G B B B B, which has 2 girls and 4 boys.
4. To estimate the number of families with this birth order, we can use the complementary probability: the probability that a family does not have the first birth order (G B G B B G) multiplied by the total number of families.
5. The probability that a family does not have the first birth order (G B G B B G) is equal to the probability of having at least one pair of the same gender together in the first five births.
6. This probability can be calculated as follows:
   - For at least one pair of the same gender in the first five births, there are two possibilities: either a pair of girls (GG) or a pair of boys (BB).
   - The probability of having a pair of girls in the first five births is (1/2)*(1/2)*(3/4)*(3/4) = 9/64.
   - The probability of having a pair of boys in the first five births is (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/4)*(1/4) = 1/64.
   - Therefore, the probability of having at least one pair of the same gender in the first five births is 9/64 + 1/64 = 10/64.
7. Now, multiply the probability of having at least one pair of the same gender in the first five births (10/64) by the total number of families (45):
   - 45 * (10/64) = 225/64 â‰ˆ 3.515625
8. Since the number of families must be a whole number, we round this estimate to the nearest whole number: 4.
9. Finally, since the first birth order (G B G B B G) accounts for half of all possible orders (due to the gender of the firstborn child not affecting the probability), we can estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B order as half of the previous result:
   - 4 / 2 = 54

Therefore, our estimate is {answer: 54} families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.
