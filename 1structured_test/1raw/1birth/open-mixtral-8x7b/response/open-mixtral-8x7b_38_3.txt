{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, this means that there are 4 boy-births and 2 girl-births in those families. Since there are always 2 genders in a family, the remaining sequence must be B G B B B B (i.e., 5 boy-births and 1 girl-birth) for the other families.

In order to estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we can use the same ratio of boy-births to girl-births found in the G B G B B G sequence.

The ratio of boy-births (B) to girl-births (G) in the G B G B B G sequence is 4:2 or simplified to 2:1.

Since there are 6 children in each family, the average number of boys in a family is 2 * 6/3 = 4 boys.
However, we're looking for families with 5 boys and 1 girl, which is 1 more boy than the average.

To estimate the number of such families, we can assume that each family has 1 more boy than the average.
Thus, we'd expect 45 * (1 + 2) = 45 * 3 = 135 families to have an extra boy compared to the average.

However, this calculation assumes that there are only 45 families surveyed, whereas the question asks for the number of families with the B G B B B B sequence among all families surveyed. As the question states that all families in the city were surveyed and we don't know the exact number of families, we'll assume that the number of families surveyed is a multiple of 45.

Let's denote the unknown number of families as 'n'. Then, the number of families with the B G B B B B sequence would be n/45 (since there are 45 families with the G B G B B G sequence).

Based on our assumption that each family has 1 more boy than the average, we'd expect 135 * n/45 = 3 * n families to have an extra boy compared to the average.

We know that there are actually 4 * n families with an extra boy, which is 1 more boy than the average. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

3 * n = 4 * n - n

Solving for n, we find that n = 3 families.

However, since the number of families must be a multiple of 45, we adjust our estimate to consider a larger multiple (e.g., 90). In this case, the number of families with the B G B B B B sequence would be 90/45 = 2 families. These estimates differ by a factor of 3, so our final estimate for the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is 45 * 3 = 54 families.
