{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

We know that there are 45 families with the birth order of G B G B B G.

Let's consider this sequence as two blocks:
1. Girl (G)
2. Boy (B), Boy (B), Girl (G), Boy (B), Boy (B) - which we can call BBGBB

Now, we want to find the number of families with the birth order of Boy (B), Girl (B), Boy (B), Boy (B), Boy (B). This can be considered as one reversed block (BBGBB) compared to the original sequence (G Berg).

To estimate the number of families with the desired birth order, we can calculate how many ways we can place this single reversed block within the original sequence (G Berg).

There are 7 positions available to place the reversed block:
1. G BBGBBBG
2. GB BBGBBG
3. GBB BBGBG
4. GBBB BBGG
5. GBBBB BGG
6. GBBBBB GG
7. GBBBBBG

So, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is equal to the original number of families (45) multiplied by the number of positions for the reversed block (7).

45 * 7 = 315

However, we have over-counted the families with the original birth order (G Berg) that remained unchanged. We need to subtract those cases from our estimate.

There are 6 positions available to place the non-reversed block (G Berg) within the original sequence (G Berg):
1. G G Berg
2. G GB erg
3. GGB Berg
4. GGB eRG
5. GGBer G
6. GGBerg

The number of families with the original birth order (G Berg) is 45. So, the actual number of families with the desired birth order (B G B B B B) is:

Estimated number - Over-counted families = 315 - 45 * 6 = 315 - 270 = 45

However, this answer is not consistent with the given information. Therefore, we should reconsider our estimate. Instead of counting the original birth order (G Berg) as a single block, we can break it down into two separate blocks: Girl (G) and Boy (B), Girl (G). Now, the reversed block (BBGBBB) has 6 positions available:

1. G BBGBBBG
2. GB BBGBBB
3. GBB BBGBB
4. GBBB BBGB
5. GBBBB BGB
6. GBBBBBGB

Now, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

45 * 6 = 270

Again, we have over-counted the families with the original birth order (G Berg). However, this time, we only need to subtract the cases where the non-reversed block (G Berg) remains unchanged:

1. G G Berg
2. GB Berg G
3. GBB ergG
4. GBBG G

The number of families with the original birth order (G Berg) is 45. So, the actual number of families with the desired birth order (B G B B B B) is:

Estimated number - Over-counted families = 270 - 45 * 4 = 270 - 180 = 90

But, this answer is also not consistent with the given information. Therefore, we must reconsider our approach.

Instead of focusing on the positions of the blocks, we can calculate the probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B and use it to estimate the number of families.

The probability of having a boy or a girl at each
