{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why:
The given data is about families with the birth order G B G B B G. Although it might be tempting to use this information to make assumptions about the distribution of boy/girl births in the population, it would not be statistically valid. The actual number of families with the birth order B G B B B B could be influenced by many factors that are not mentioned in the question, such as the overall gender ratio, genetic factors, or even the possibility of multiple births (twins, triplets, etc.). Without this information, we cannot accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
