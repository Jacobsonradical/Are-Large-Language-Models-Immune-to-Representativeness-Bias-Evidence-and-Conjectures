{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

The problem states that we are looking at families with six children, and in this particular sample, the order of births was G B G B B G. This gives us a pattern where the gender of the child alternates between boys and girls (B G B G B G).

We want to find out how many families follow the pattern B G B B B B, which means five boys followed by one girl.

Since the gender of the child alternates in the first pattern, let's assume that boys are more likely to be born than girls, or that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each). This assumption will help us estimate the number of families with the pattern B G B B B B.

To estimate the number of families with the pattern B G B B B B, we can use the same probability for each gender and multiply it by the total number of families and the desired pattern. The formula for this would be:

Number of families with the pattern B G B B B B = (probability of having a boy) * (probability of having a girl) ^ 5 * (total number of families)

Given that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5), we can calculate the number of families with the desired pattern as follows:

Number of families with the pattern B G B B B B = (0.5) * (0.5) ^ 5 * 45 = (0.5) * (0.03125) * 45 ≈ 0.078125 * 45 ≈ 3.5625 ≈ 3 or 4

Since the number of families cannot be fractional, let's round it to the nearest whole number. Thus, our estimate of the number of families with the pattern B G B B B B is 4.

However, if we consider that the sample size (45 families) is not very large, it is possible that the actual number of families with the pattern B G B B B B could be slightly different from our estimate due to chance. Given the sample size, let's assume a 95% confidence interval for the true value of families with the pattern B G B B B B.

To calculate the 95% confidence interval, we can use the following formula:

95% CI = p ± 2 * sqrt[(p * (1 - p)) / n]

Where:
- p is the proportion of families with the pattern B G B B B B
- n is the total number of families

Using our estimated proportion (3.5625 / 45 ≈ 0.07916), the 95% confidence interval is:

95% CI = 0.07916 ± 2 * sqrt[(0.07916 * (1 - 0.07916)) / 45] ≈ 0.07916 ± 0.1744 ≈ (-0.09524, 0.25356)

This means that the true value of families with the pattern B G B B B B is likely to be between -9.5% (which isn't possible) and approximately 25.4% of the sample size (45 families). This corresponds to a range of 0 to 11.37 families (approximately) with the pattern B G B B B B.

Given the sample size and our assumptions, we can estimate that the number of families with the pattern B G B B B B is likely between 0 and 11. A reasonable estimate, considering these factors, is the mid-point of this range, which is 5.5. However, the number of families cannot be a fraction, so let's round it to the nearest whole number. Thus, our estimate of the number of families with the pattern B G B B B B is 6.
