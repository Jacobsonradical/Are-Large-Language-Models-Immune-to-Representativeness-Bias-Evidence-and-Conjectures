{answer: Around 27 families}

Here's the reasoning:

The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, which is 0.5 or 50% for both. So, the probability of having a specific sequence of boys and girls in a family of six children is 1/64 (0.5^6, since there are six births and each has two possibilities: boy or girl).

In the survey, 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G. This sequence has a probability of 1/64. If we want to find out how many families would have the sequence B G B B B B (all boys except for one girl), we just need to multiply the total number of families by the probability of this specific sequence, which is:

64 * 45 = 2880

However, this number is the total possible outcomes for all families in the city, not the number of families surveyed. To estimate the number of families surveyed, we divide the total possible outcomes by the total number of families surveyed for the first sequence (G B G B B G). The given problem states that this number is 45. So,

Estimated number of families = Total possible outcomes / Probability of the first sequence
Estimated number of families = 2880 / 45 â‰ˆ 64

Since the number must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 64. But this estimate seems too high because having only one girl in a family of six is quite rare. So, let's consider rounding down to 27 families instead. This would mean that the survey was not representative enough of the entire city's population.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is around 27 families.
