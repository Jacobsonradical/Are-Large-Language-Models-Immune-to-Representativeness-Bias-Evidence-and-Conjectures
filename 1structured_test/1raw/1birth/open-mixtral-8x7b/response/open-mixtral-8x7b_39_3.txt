{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, that means there are 4 births of each gender in those families. Since there are six children in each family, the remaining birth(s) must be of the same gender as the first child.

Now, let's consider the sequence we're interested in: B G B B B B. This sequence also has 4 births of boys and 2 births of girls. The only difference is that the first child is a boy instead of a girl.

Since the gender of the first child doesn't affect the overall number of boy and girl births, it is reasonable to assume that the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be the same as those with the sequence G B G B B G.

Therefore, there should be 45 families with the sequence B G B B B B. However, the question asks for the exact order of births, which means that the last two girls in the sequence might be reversed (B G B B G B). Considering this possibility, there is a total of 2 possible sequences with alternating genders (B G B B B B or B G B B G B).

Hence, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be 45 / 2 = 54 families.
