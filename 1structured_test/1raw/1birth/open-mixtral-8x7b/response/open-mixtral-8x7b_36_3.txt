{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G_B_G_B_B_G occurs in 45 families, this particular sequence has 3 girls (G) and 3 boys (B), with a girl always being born first and last in this sequence. This means that there are two neutral slots in the sequence where either a boy or a girl could be born without changing the pattern's count.

Now, consider the desired sequence: B_G_B_B_B_B. This sequence has 3 girls (G) and 3 boys (B) as well, but with a boy always being born first and last. We need to estimate how many families would have this particular arrangement based on the information given about the sequence G_B_G_B_B_G.

Since there are two neutral slots in the original sequence, and we need to reverse the genders for the first and last births, there are two possible sequences that would result in the desired sequence:
- B_G_G_B_B_G (reversing the first and last births)
- G_B_G_B_B_B (filling the first neutral slot with a boy)

Therefore, the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births is B_G_B_B_B_B would be approximately half of the given number, which is (45/2) = 22.5. However, since we cannot have half a family, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 23. However, since the original sample was a whole number, we should estimate the result as a whole number too. This means that 23 might be slightly overestimated, and a more reasonable estimate would be 22.

Now, accounting for randomness in birth orders (and assuming that the survey is a good representation of that randomness), we can estimate that the probability of having a boy or a girl is roughly equal. This means that the desired sequence (B_G_B_B_B_B) should occur as frequently as the original sequence (G_B_G_B_B_G) with respect to the total number of families surveyed.

Thus, we can estimate that the number of families with the desired sequence (B_G_B_B_B_B) is close to the given number (45) multiplied by the estimated ratio (23/45), which is 102/9 or approximately 11.33. Again, rounding to the nearest whole number would result in 11, but considering the randomness in birth orders and the assumption of equal probabilities, a more reasonable estimate would be somewhere in between 11 and 12.

However, to provide a single-value answer for the purpose of this question, the closest whole number that seems reasonable based on the given information and the assumptions made is:

This answer can be considered an overestimation, but it is the closest integer estimate that still respects the randomness of birth orders while accounting for the given information.
