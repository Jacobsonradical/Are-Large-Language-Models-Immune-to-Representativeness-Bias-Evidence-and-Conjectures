{answer: The number of families with the order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that boy and girl births are equally likely and independent, we can use the given data to estimate the probability of the B G B B B G pattern, then use this probability to estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern.

The probability of B G B B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64. 

If there are N families in total, we would expect (1/64)N families to have the B G B B B G pattern. By symmetry, we would also expect (1/64)N families to have the B G B B B B pattern. 

Therefore, if 45 families have the B G B B B G pattern, we would estimate about 45 families to have the B G B B B B pattern. But please note that this is an estimate based on the assumption of equal and independent boy and girl births, and the actual number could be different.}
