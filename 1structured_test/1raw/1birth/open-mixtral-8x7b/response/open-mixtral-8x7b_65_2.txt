{answer: 54}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the sex of each child is determined randomly and independently, and that there is an equal chance of a boy or a girl being born.

In a family of six children, the probability that the exact order of births is B G B B B B is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64.

The probability that the exact order of births is G B G B B G is also 1/64.

Since there are 45 families with the G B G B B G order, there should be 64/45 * 45 = 64 families with the B G B B B B order, assuming the sex of each child is determined randomly and independently.

However, since this is an estimate based on assumptions, the actual number of families with the B G B B B B order may be different.
