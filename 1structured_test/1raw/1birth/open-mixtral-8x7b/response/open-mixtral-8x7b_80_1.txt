{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we assume that the gender of each child is determined randomly and independently, we can estimate the probability of this birth order and use it to make a prediction.

The probability of a boy is 1/2, and the probability of a girl is also 1/2. Therefore, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

If we further assume that the sample of 45 families is representative of the population of families in the city, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as (1/64) * (number of families surveyed) = (1/64) * 45 = 0.703125. However, this estimate is not precise and should be interpreted with caution.}
