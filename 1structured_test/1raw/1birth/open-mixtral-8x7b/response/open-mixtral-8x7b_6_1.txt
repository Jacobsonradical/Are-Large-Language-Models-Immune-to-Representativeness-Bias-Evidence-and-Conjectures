{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the ratio of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G to the total number of families surveyed is known (45 families), we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. 

The birth order G B G B B G has 3 girls and 3 boys, so the ratio of girls to boys is 3:3, or just 1:1. This means that the total number of children in these 45 families is 6 * 45 = 270 children. Since the total number of children in all families is equal to the sum of girls and boys, we can determine that there are 135 girls and 135 boys in these families.

Now, let's consider families with the birth order B G B B B B. In this case, there are 2 girls and 4 boys, so the ratio of girls to boys is 2:4, or 1:2. We want to find out how many families with this birth order there are among the total number of families surveyed.

Let X be the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. The total number of girls in these families is 2X, and the total number of boys is 4X.

Now, we know that the total number of girls among all families surveyed is 135, and the total number of boys is also 135. So, we can write the equation:

135 = 2X + 135 (the total number of girls)

Solving for X, we get X = 135 / 2 = 67.5

However, the number of families must be a whole number, not a fraction. Since X should be greater than the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G (which is 45), we can estimate that X is 67.5 + 45 = 112.5. The closest whole number is 112.

However, this number is still not accurate, because we made an assumption that the total number of boys and girls in all families surveyed is exactly 135 each. In reality, the actual number of families surveyed may be slightly different, so we can estimate that the actual number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is around 112 +/- 10. To be on the safe side and considering possible fluctuations, we can round up and say that there are approximately 54 families with the birth order B G B B B B.
