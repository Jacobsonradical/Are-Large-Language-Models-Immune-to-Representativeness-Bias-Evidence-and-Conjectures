{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. In the given data, the ratio of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G to the total number of families surveyed is 45/total families.
2. Since there are six children in each family, the ratio of boys to girls is always 3:3.
3. Therefore, in the birth order G B G B B G, there are three girls and three boys.
4. To find the total number of families surveyed, we can use the given data and set up a proportion: 45/total families = 1/2 (since the ratio of boys to girls is 3:3 or 1:1).
5. Solving for "total families," we get: total families = 45 * 2 = 90 families.
6. Now, we want to find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, which has three boys and three girls as well.
7. Using the same reasoning as above, we can set up another proportion: x/families with birth order B G B B B B = 1/2.
8. Since the total number of families is 90, and the ratio of families with birth order B G B B B B to the total number of families is 1:2, then the number of families with birth order B G B B B B is: x = 90/3 = 30 families.
9. However, since the question asks for an estimate, and considering that the sample size is not extremely large, we can round up or down the number of families with birth order B G B B B B to be closer to the actual number.
10. Considering that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, a reasonable estimate for the number of families with birth order B G B B B B would be around 54 families (half of 108, which is the nearest round number to 90).
