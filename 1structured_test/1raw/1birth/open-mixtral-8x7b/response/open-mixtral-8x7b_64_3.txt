{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The problem states that all families of six children in a city were surveyed.
2. In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
3. There are 7! (7 factorial) = 5040 different possible birth order sequences for six children (regardless of gender).
4. Half of these sequences (2520) will start with a girl, and the other half will start with a boy.
5. Since the survey includes all families with six children, and we know the number of families with one particular sequence (G B G B B G), we can estimate the number of families with the reverse sequence (B G B B B B) by assuming an equal distribution of family types.
6. To find this estimate, divide the total number of possible sequences by 2 (to account for the two types of sequences we're considering): 5040 / 2 = 2520.
7. Since we know one of these types of sequences (G B G B B G) occurs in 45 families, the other type of sequence (B G B B B B) will occur in approximately 2520 / 45 * 45 = 54 families, assuming equal distribution.
