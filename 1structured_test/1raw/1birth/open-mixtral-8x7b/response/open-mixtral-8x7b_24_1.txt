{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. The number of ways to arrange the sequence G B G B B G for 6 children, with regard to birth order, is 6! / (2! * 1!) = 180, since there are two instances of 'G' and one instance of 'B'.
2. This survey found that order in 45 families, so the total number of families surveyed would be 180 * 45 = 8100.
3. Now, we want to find the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B.
4. The number of ways to arrange the sequence B G B B B B for 6 children is 6! / (1!) = 720.
5. To estimate the number of families with this sequence, we can divide the total number of families by the total number of possible sequences and then multiply it by the number of ways to arrange B G B B B B. So, our estimate is (8100 * 720) / 180 = 54.
