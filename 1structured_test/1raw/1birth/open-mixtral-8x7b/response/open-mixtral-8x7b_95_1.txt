{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be similar to those with the birth order G B G B B G, so a reasonable estimate would be around 45.}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the gender of each child is determined randomly and there is an equal chance of having a boy or a girl. Therefore, the sequence of boys and girls in families should be fairly evenly distributed.
