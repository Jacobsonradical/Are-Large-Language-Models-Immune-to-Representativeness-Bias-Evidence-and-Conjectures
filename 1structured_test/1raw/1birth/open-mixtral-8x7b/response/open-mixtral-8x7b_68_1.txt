{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information given. However, if we know the total number of families surveyed, we could potentially use this information to make an educated estimate.}

Without knowing the total number of families surveyed or the distribution of other birth order patterns, it is not possible to accurately estimate the number of families with the birth order pattern B G B B B B.
