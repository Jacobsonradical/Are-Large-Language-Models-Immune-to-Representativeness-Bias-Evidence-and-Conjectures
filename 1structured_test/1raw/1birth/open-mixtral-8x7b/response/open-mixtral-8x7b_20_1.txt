{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the given data.}

Here's why: The information provided only states that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, but it does not give any data about other birth order patterns, including B G B B B B. Without this data, we can't estimate the number of families with this specific birth order pattern.
