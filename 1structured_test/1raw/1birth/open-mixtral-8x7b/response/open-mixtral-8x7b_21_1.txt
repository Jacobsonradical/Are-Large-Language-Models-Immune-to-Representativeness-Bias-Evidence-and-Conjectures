{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be similar to those with the birth order G B G B B G, so a reasonable estimate would be around 45 families.}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the sex of the child is determined randomly and the gender of each child is independent of the other children's genders. Under these assumptions, the number of families with a particular birth order pattern should be roughly the same as the number of families with the reverse pattern. Therefore, since there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we would expect a similar number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
