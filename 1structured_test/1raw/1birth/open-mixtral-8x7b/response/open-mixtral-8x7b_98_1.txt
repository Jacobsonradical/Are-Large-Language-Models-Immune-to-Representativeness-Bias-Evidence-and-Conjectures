{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the information provided.}

Here's why: The information given only tells us about the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G. It does not provide any data about the number of families with any other birth order pattern, including B G B B B B. In order to estimate the number of families with this specific birth order pattern, we would need data related to that particular pattern.
