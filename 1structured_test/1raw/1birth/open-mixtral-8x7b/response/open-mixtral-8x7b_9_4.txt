{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, this means that there are 3 boys and 3 girls in these families, as the order of births is fixed. The total number of arrangements for 3 boys and 3 girls is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / [(n-r)!r!], where n is the total number of elements and r is the number of elements to be chosen at a time. In this case, n = 6 and r = 3.

So, the total number of possible arrangements for 3 boys and 3 girls is C(6, 3) = 6! / [(6-3)!3!] = 20.

Since we have 45 families with this particular sequence, the probability of this sequence occurring is 45/20 = 9/4.

Now, we want to find the sequence with 4 boys and 2 girls. As there are 6 children in the family, the total number of arrangements for 4 boys and 2 girls is C(6, 4) = 6! / [(6-4)!4!] = 15.

To estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we multiply the probability of a specific sequence occurring (9/4) by the total number of possible arrangements for 4 boys and 2 girls (15).

Hence, our estimate is (9/4) * 15 = 54 families.
