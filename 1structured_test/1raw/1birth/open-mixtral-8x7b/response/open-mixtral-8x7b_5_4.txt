{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

Since the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is 45, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. 

Assuming an equal probability of having a boy or a girl (which is a common assumption in such problems), the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is the same as having the birth order B G B B B B. 

So, if there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, then there should be an equal number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. 

Therefore, our estimate is 45 families with the birth order B G B B B B. However, since the question asks for the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we need to account for the fact that the first birth could be a boy or a girl. So, we need to double our initial estimate to account for both possibilities. 

Hence, our final estimate is 2 * 45 = 90 families. However, since the total number of families surveyed is not specified, we cannot provide an exact answer. Therefore, we estimate that 54 families had the exact order of births as B G B B B B, assuming that the number of families surveyed is a multiple of 3.
