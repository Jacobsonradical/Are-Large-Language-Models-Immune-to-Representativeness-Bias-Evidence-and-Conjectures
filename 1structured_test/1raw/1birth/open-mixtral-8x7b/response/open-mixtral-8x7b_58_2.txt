{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. In the given data, the ratio of the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G to the total number of families surveyed is 45/number of families.
2. Since there are six positions for children to be born, and boys (B) and girls (G) alternate in the desired birth order (B G B B B B), we can represent this pattern as a repeating sequence of two letters: BG.
3. In this case, there are three sequences of BG: BG | BG | BG.
4. To find the number of families that have the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we need to determine how many ways these three sequences can be arranged. This is a permutation problem, and the formula for permutations is: P(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!, where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and "!" denotes factorial.
5. Plugging in our values, we get: P(6, 3) = 6! / (6 - 3)! = 720 / 6 = 120.
6. Now, we need to find the proportion of families with the desired birth order (B G B B B B) out of the total number of families surveyed. Since there are 120 possible arrangements of B G B B B B, and 45 of them are G B G B B G, the proportion is 45/120.
7. To find the total number of families surveyed, we can set up the equation: 45/120 = 45/number of families. Solving for "number of families," we get: number of families = 120 * 45 = 5400.
8. However, since the total number of families must be a whole number, we need to adjust our estimate. Considering that the sample is likely to be a rounded number, we can estimate that there were 44 or 46 families with the birth order G B G B B G, which would result in 54 or 52 families with the birth order B G B B B B. Thus, our best estimate is the average of these two possibilities: (54 + 52) / 2 = 53.
9. Therefore, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is {answer: 54}.
