{answer: 54}

Here's the reasoning:

If the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, this particular sequence of boys and girls is not that uncommon. Since there are two possibilities for each birth (boy or girl), and assuming equal probabilities, the sequence B G _ _ _ _ _ should occur just as frequently as G B _ _ _ _ _ if the gender of the children is determined randomly.

To estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we simply need to calculate the ratio of the desired sequence to the observed sequence:

Desired sequence (B G B B B B) : Observed sequence (G B G B B G) = 1 : 1

Since we've observed 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate that the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is also:

45 * (1/1) = 45

However, this is an underestimation, as it assumes that all families with the B G _ _ _ _ _ sequence have a boy in the first unspecified position. In reality, half of those families should have the B G B _ _ _ _ sequence instead. Therefore, we need to double our initial estimate:

Estimate = 2 * 45 = 54 families
