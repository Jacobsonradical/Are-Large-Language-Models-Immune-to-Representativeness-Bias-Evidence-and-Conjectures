{answer: The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be roughly the same as those with the birth order G B G B B G, so it is also 45.}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The prompt gives us the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.
2. Since the question doesn't mention any other factors influencing gender selection, we can assume that the birth order of boys and girls is random.
3. Therefore, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B G should also be the same, because the gender distribution is random.
4. To find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can apply the same logic. Since the distribution is random, the number of families with all boys or all girls should be significantly less than those with a mix of boys and girls.
5. Hence, a reasonable estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be around the same as those with the birth order G B G B B G, which is 45.
