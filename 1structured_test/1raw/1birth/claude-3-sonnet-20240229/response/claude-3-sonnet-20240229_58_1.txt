To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The birth order of boys and girls is random and independent of other families.
2. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).

Given:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G.
- The total number of families with six children is unknown.

Since the birth order is random and independent, the probability of having any specific order of births is the same for all orders.

The probability of having the order G B G B B G is (0.5)^6 = 1/64, as there are 6 births, and each birth has a 0.5 probability of being a boy or a girl.

Similarly, the probability of having the order B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6 = 1/64.

Since the probabilities are equal, we can assume that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is approximately the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
