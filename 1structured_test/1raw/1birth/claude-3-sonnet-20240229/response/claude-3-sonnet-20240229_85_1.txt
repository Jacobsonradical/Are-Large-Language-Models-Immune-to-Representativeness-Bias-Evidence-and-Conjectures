To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then calculate the proportion of families with the order GBGBBG. Assuming that the gender of each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, and that the births are independent events, we can use the following approach:

1. The total number of possible orders for six children is 2^6 = 64 (since each child can be either a boy or a girl).
2. The number of orders with the pattern GBGBBG is 1 (the given order).
3. The proportion of families with the order GBGBBG is 1/64.
4. To find the number of families with the order BGBBBBB, we need to count the number of orders with six boys, which is also 1.
5. Therefore, the proportion of families with the order BGBBBBB is also 1/64.

Since the proportions of families with the orders GBGBBG and BGBBBBB are the same, we can assume that the number of families with each order is also the same.

Therefore, my estimate is:
