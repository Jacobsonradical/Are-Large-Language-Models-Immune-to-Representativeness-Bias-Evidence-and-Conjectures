To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the following:

1. The given order of births (G B G B B G) involves 6 children.
2. The order we want to estimate (B G B B B B) also involves 6 children.
3. Since there are 6 children in each family, the possible orders of births are the permutations of 3 boys and 3 girls.
4. The total number of permutations of 3 boys and 3 girls is 6! / (3! * 3!) = 20.
5. The given order (G B G B B G) is one of these 20 permutations.
6. Assuming that all permutations are equally likely, the probability of any specific permutation occurring is 1/20.
7. Since 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by multiplying 45 by the probability of that order occurring, which is 1/20.

{answer: 45 / 20 = 2.25}

Therefore, my estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is approximately 2.25 families.
