To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl in each birth.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5) for each birth, we can calculate the probability of having the order B G B B B B as (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 (since there are 6 births, and the probability of each individual birth being a boy or a girl is 0.5).

Given that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, and assuming that the probability of having any specific order is the same, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

Number of families with order B G B B B B = (45 Ã— 0.015625) / 0.015625 = 45

Therefore, my estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
