To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then determine the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G. We can then use this proportion to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are families with six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible birth orders for six children.
Number of possible birth orders = 2^6 = 64
(Each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), and there are 6 children, so 2^6 possible combinations.)

Step 2: Calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.
Proportion of families with the order G B G B B G = 45 / 64

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Since there is only one possible order with all boys (B G B B B B), we can use the same proportion to estimate the number of families with this order.

Number of families with the order B G B B B B = Proportion of families with the order G B G B B G × 1
Number of families with the order B G B B B B = (45 / 64) × 1
Number of families with the order B G B B B B ≈ 0.703125

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
