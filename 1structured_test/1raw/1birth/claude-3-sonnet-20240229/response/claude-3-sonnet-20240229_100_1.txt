To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of having that specific order of births.

Given information:
- There are six children in each family.
- The order of births in 45 families was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the gender of each child is equally likely (50% chance of being a boy or a girl), the probability of having the order B G B B B B in a family of six children is:

Probability(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since we know that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is much larger than 45. Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by scaling the probability accordingly.

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is reasonably large, say, around 1000 families.

Number of families with the order B G B B B B = 1000 × (1/64) ≈ 15.625

Therefore, your estimate would be:

{answer: 16}

Note: This estimate assumes that the gender of each child is independent and equally likely, and that the sample size of 1000 families is reasonable. The actual number may vary slightly due to random fluctuations in the data.
