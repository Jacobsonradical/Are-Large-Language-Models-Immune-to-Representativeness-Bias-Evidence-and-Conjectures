To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The order of births is random, and all possible orders are equally likely.
2. The families surveyed represent a random sample of all families with six children in the city.

Given information:
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- There are 2^6 = 64 possible orders of births for six children.

Since all possible orders are equally likely, the probability of any specific order occurring is 1/64.

The probability of the order G B G B B G occurring is 45/64 (since 45 out of 64 families had this order).

Assuming the same probability for the order B G B B B B, we can estimate the number of families with that order as:

(Probability of B G B B B B) = (Probability of G B G B B G) = 45/64

Number of families with the order B G B B B B = (45/64) Ã— 64 = 45

Therefore, my estimate is:
