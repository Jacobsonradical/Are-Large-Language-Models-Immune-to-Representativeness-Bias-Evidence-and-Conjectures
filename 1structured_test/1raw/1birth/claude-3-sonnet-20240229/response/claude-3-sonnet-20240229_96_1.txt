To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the possible orders of births for families with six children.

Given:
- There are 6 children in each family.
- The order of births in 45 families was G B G B B G.

Since there are two possible outcomes for each child (boy or girl), the total number of possible orders of births for families with six children is 2^6 = 64.

We know that the order G B G B B G occurs 45 times out of the 64 possible orders.

To find the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we need to consider the remaining 19 orders (64 - 45 = 19).

The order B G B B B B is one of these 19 remaining orders, and since we have no additional information about the distribution of the remaining orders, we can assume that they are equally likely.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 19 / 19 = 1}
