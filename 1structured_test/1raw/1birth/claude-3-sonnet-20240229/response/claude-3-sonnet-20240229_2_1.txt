To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The births of boys and girls are independent events (assuming no external factors influencing the gender ratio).
2. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).
3. The order of births is equally likely for all possible combinations.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G.

The total number of possible birth orders for six children is 2^6 = 64 (since each child can be either a boy or a girl).

The probability of having the order G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64 (since each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl).

Similarly, the probability of having the order B G B B B B is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Since the probabilities are equal, we can assume that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is approximately the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
