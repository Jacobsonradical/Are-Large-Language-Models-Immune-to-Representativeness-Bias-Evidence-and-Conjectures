To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, I need to make some assumptions based on the information given.

Given information:
- The survey was conducted on all families with six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the birth order was G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
- The birth order of the children follows a random pattern, with equal probability of having a boy or a girl for each birth.
- The birth orders G B G B B G and B G B B B B are equally likely to occur.

Since there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, and assuming that the two birth orders are equally likely, we can estimate that there will be approximately 45 families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
