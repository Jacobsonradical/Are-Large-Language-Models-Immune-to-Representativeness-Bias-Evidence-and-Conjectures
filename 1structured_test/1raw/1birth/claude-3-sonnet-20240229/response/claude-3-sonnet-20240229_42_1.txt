To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the possible permutations of the birth order and make assumptions about the underlying probability distribution.

Given information:
- The survey included all families of six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
- The order of births is equally likely (assuming no underlying factors favoring a particular gender or birth order).
- The total number of families with six children is not provided, but we can estimate it based on the given information.

There are 2^6 = 64 possible permutations of six children, with each permutation being equally likely under the assumption.

The number of permutations with the order B G B B B B is 1 out of 64.

If there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, then we can estimate the total number of families by assuming that the proportion of families with each order is approximately equal.

Total number of families ≈ 45 × 64 = 2,880

Since there is one permutation with the order B G B B B B, we can estimate the number of families with that order as:

Number of families with the order B G B B B B ≈ 2,880 / 64 = 45

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
