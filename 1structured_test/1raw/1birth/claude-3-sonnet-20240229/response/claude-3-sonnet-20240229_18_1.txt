To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then determine the fraction of families with the order GBGBBG. This fraction can then be applied to the total number of families to estimate the number of families with the order BGBBBB.

Given information:
- There are families with six children.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was GBGBBG.

Assumption:
- The birth order of boys and girls is equally likely (assuming no external factors influence the gender of the child).

Step 1: Find the total number of possible birth orders for six children.
There are 2 possibilities for each child (either boy or girl).
Total number of possible birth orders = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2^6 = 64

Step 2: Find the fraction of families with the order GBGBBG.
Fraction of families with the order GBGBBG = 45 / 64

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the order BGBBBB.
Since the birth order is equally likely, the fraction of families with the order BGBBBB should be the same as the fraction of families with the order GBGBBG.
Estimated number of families with the order BGBBBB = 45 / 64 × 64 = 45

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order BGBBBB is 45.

{answer: 45}
