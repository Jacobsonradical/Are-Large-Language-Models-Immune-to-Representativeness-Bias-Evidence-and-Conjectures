To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

Assumption 1: The birth order of boys and girls is random and independent of the previous births.
Assumption 2: The total number of families with six children is much larger than the 45 families with the specific order G B G B B G.

Under these assumptions, we can consider the birth order of six children as a sequence of six independent trials, where each trial has two possible outcomes: Boy (B) or Girl (G). The probability of getting a specific order, like B G B B B B, is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, since there are two equally likely outcomes in each trial, and the trials are independent.

The number of families with the order G B G B B G is given as 45. If we assume that the total number of families with six children is much larger than 45, then the ratio of families with the order B G B B B B to those with the order G B G B B G should be approximately 1:1.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}

Note: This estimate is based on the assumptions mentioned above and may not be accurate if those assumptions do not hold true in the given scenario. Additionally, if the total number of families with six children is not significantly larger than 45, the estimate may not be reliable.
