To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to consider the following:

1. The question states that there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G.
2. In a family with six children, there are 6! = 720 possible birth orders.
3. The order G B G B B G has 6 permutations (by rearranging the positions of the same gender children).
4. The order B G B B B B also has 6 permutations.

Assuming an equal probability of occurrence for all birth orders, the number of families with the order B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

Therefore, my estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
