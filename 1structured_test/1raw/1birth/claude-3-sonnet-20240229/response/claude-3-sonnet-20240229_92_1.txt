To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the following:

1. The question states that the survey was conducted for all families of six children in the city.
2. There are 2^6 = 64 possible combinations of boys (B) and girls (G) in a family with six children.
3. The given order G B G B B G is one of these 64 combinations.
4. The desired order B G B B B B is also one of the 64 combinations.

Since all possible combinations are equally likely to occur, and we have no additional information to suggest any bias, we can assume that each combination is equally likely to be observed.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B should be:

{answer: 1}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the order of births is equally likely for all families, and since there are 64 possible combinations, each combination is expected to occur roughly 1/64 times in the surveyed population.
