To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and make an assumption about the probability of this specific birth order occurring.

Given information:
- The survey covered all families of six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assumption:
Let's assume that all possible orders of births of boys (B) and girls (G) are equally likely to occur.

There are 2^6 = 64 possible orders of births for six children (each child can be either a boy or a girl).

Since there are 6 children in each family, the number of families with the order B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G, which is 45.

Therefore, under the assumption of equal probability, we can estimate that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is also 45.

{answer: 45}
