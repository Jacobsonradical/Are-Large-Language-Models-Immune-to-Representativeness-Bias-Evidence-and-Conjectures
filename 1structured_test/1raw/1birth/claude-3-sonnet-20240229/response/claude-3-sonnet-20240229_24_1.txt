To solve this problem, we need to find the number of possible arrangements of six children with four boys (B) and two girls (G).

The total number of arrangements for six children is 6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720.

However, we need to consider the arrangements where the two girls (G) are distinct and the four boys (B) are also distinct. This is because the order of births matters in the given scenario.

There are 2! = 2 ways to arrange the two girls, and 4! = 24 ways to arrange the four boys.

Therefore, the total number of arrangements with four boys and two girls is:
(6! / (2! x 4!)) = (720 / (2 x 24)) = 15

So, my estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 15}
