To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then calculate the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B. Finally, we can multiply the probability by the total number of families to get an estimate of the number of families with that birth order.

Given information:
- There are families with six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible birth orders for six children.
Total number of birth orders = 2^6 = 64
(Each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), and there are 6 children, so there are 2 possibilities for each child, resulting in 2^6 total possible orders.)

Step 2: Calculate the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B.
There is only one order that satisfies B G B B B B.
Probability of having the birth order B G B B B B = 1 / 64

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
We know that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G.
Assuming that all birth orders are equally likely, we can use the ratio of probabilities to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Probability of having the birth order G B G B B G = 1 / 64
Probability of having the birth order B G B B B B = 1 / 64

Since the probabilities are equal, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B = 45

Therefore, the answer is:
{answer: 45}
