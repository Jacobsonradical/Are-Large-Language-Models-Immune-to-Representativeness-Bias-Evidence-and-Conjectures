To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the possible permutations of the birth order and the likelihood of each permutation occurring.

Given:
- There are 6 children in each family.
- The order of births in 45 families was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5) for each birth, and that the births are independent events, we can calculate the probability of the order B G B B B B as follows:

Probability of having a boy for the first child = 0.5
Probability of having a girl for the second child = 0.5
Probability of having a boy for the third child = 0.5
Probability of having a boy for the fourth child = 0.5
Probability of having a boy for the fifth child = 0.5
Probability of having a boy for the sixth child = 0.5

Probability of the order B G B B B B = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.03125 (or 3.125%)

Since there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and assuming that the probability of having any other order is equal, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as:

Estimated number of families with order B G B B B B = (45 × 0.03125) ≈ 1.41 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
