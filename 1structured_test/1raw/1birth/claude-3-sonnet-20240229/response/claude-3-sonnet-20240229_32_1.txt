To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The order of births is independent of the family size.
2. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the order G B G B B G.
- The total number of families with six children is unknown.

We can calculate the probability of having the order G B G B B G as follows:
Probability of G B G B B G = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 (since each birth has an equal probability of 0.5)

Let's assume that the number of families with six children is N.
Then, the expected number of families with the order G B G B B G = N × 0.015625

We know that the observed number of families with this order is 45.
Therefore, we can set up the equation:
N × 0.015625 = 45

Solving for N, we get:
N = 45 / 0.015625
N = 2880

Since the question asks for the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can calculate the probability of this order as:
Probability of B G B B B B = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 (same as G B G B B G)

Therefore, the expected number of families with the order B G B B B B = N × 0.015625 = 2880 × 0.015625 = 45

{answer: 45}
