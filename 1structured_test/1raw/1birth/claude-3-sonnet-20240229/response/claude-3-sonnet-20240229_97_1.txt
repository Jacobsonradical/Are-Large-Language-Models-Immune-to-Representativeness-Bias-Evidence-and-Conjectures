To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the possible combinations of boys and girls in families of six children.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the order G B G B B G.
- The total number of families with six children is unknown.

Assumptions:
- The gender of each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl.
- The order of births is independent of the family.

Since there are 6 children in each family, there are 2^6 = 64 possible combinations of boys and girls.

The combination B G B B B B is one of these 64 possibilities.

If we assume that all combinations are equally likely, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as:

Number of families with B G B B B B = (45 / Number of families with G B G B B G) × 64

Since we don't know the total number of families with six children, we can't calculate the exact value. However, we can provide a range of estimates based on different assumptions about the number of families with G B G B B G.

For example, if we assume that there are 100 families with the order G B G B B G, then the estimate would be:
Number of families with B G B B B B = (45 / 100) × 64 = 28.8 ≈ 29

However, if we assume that there are 200 families with the order G B G B B G, then the estimate would be:
Number of families with B G B B B B = (45 / 200) × 64 = 14.4 ≈ 14

Therefore, the estimate can be provided as a range:

{answer: Between 14 and 29 families}
