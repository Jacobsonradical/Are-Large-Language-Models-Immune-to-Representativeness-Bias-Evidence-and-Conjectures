To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make an assumption about the probability of having a boy or a girl in each birth.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5) for each birth, and that the births are independent events, we can calculate the probability of having the order B G B B B B as follows:

Probability of having a boy in the first birth: 0.5
Probability of having a girl in the second birth: 0.5
Probability of having a boy in the third birth: 0.5
Probability of having a boy in the fourth birth: 0.5
Probability of having a boy in the fifth birth: 0.5
Probability of having a boy in the sixth birth: 0.5

The probability of having the order B G B B B B is the product of these individual probabilities:
Probability of B G B B B B = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.015625 (approximately 1.56%)

Given that there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and assuming that the probability of having any particular order is equal, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

Number of families with B G B B B B = (0.015625 / 0.015625) × 45 = 45

Therefore, your estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
