To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific birth order and relate it to the given information about the families with the order G B G B B G.

Given:
- There are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Assuming that the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely, the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is the same as the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B.

The total number of possible birth orders for six children is 2^6 = 64 (since each child can be either a boy or a girl).

The probability of having the birth order G B G B B G or B G B B B B is 1/64.

Since there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate that there should be an equal number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
