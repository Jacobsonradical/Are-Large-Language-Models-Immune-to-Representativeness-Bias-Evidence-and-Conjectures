To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to consider the concept of permutations and the fact that the order of births is important.

Given information:
- The exact order of births in 45 families was G B G B B G.
- We want to find the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50% chance for each), and the births are independent events, we can calculate the probability of having the order B G B B B B as follows:

Probability of having the order B G B B B B = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by considering the ratio of probabilities.

Probability of having the order G B G B B G = (1/2)^6 = 1/64 (same as B G B B B B)

If there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and the probabilities of both orders are equal, we can estimate that there are also 45 families with the order B G B B B B.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:
