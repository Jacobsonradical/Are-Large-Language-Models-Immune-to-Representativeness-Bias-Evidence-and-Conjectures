To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G. We can then use this proportion to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are families with six children.
- In 45 families, the order of births was G B G B B G.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible orders for six children.
Total number of possible orders = 2^6 = 64

Step 2: Calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.
Proportion of families with the order G B G B B G = 45 / 64

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Since there are six positions, and the order B G B B B B has the same number of boys and girls as G B G B B G, their proportions should be the same.

Estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B = 45 / 64

{answer: 45}
