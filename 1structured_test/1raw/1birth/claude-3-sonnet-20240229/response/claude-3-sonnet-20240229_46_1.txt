To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible arrangements of boys (B) and girls (G) in families with six children.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G.

Since the order of births is important, we can calculate the total number of possible arrangements of six children using permutations.

The total number of permutations of 6 objects (3 boys and 3 girls) is:
P(6, 3) = 6! / (3! × 3!) = 720 / (6 × 6) = 20

Therefore, there are 20 possible arrangements of 3 boys and 3 girls.

Since we know that there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and this is one of the 20 possible arrangements, we can assume that the other 19 arrangements are equally likely.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with any other arrangement, which is 45.

{answer: 45}
