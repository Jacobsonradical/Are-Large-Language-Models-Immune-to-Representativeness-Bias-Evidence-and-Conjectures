To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of having a specific birth order in families with six children.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

Assuming an equal probability of having a boy or a girl for each birth, the probability of having any specific order of births is the same for all possible orders.

There are 2^6 = 64 possible orders of births for six children (since each child can be either a boy or a girl).

Since there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and all orders are equally likely, we can estimate that there should be approximately 45 families with the order B G B B B B as well.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{answer: 45}
