To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the assumption that the gender of a child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, and that the births are independent events.

Given:
- There are 6 children in each family.
- The exact order of births in 45 families was G B G B B G.

Since the total number of possible orders for 6 children is 2^6 = 64, and the order G B G B B G is one of these possibilities, the probability of observing this order is 1/64.

Assuming that the gender of each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, the probability of the order B G B B B B is also 1/64.

If there were N families surveyed in total, we would expect to see approximately (N/64) families with the order B G B B B B, since the probabilities are equal.

Therefore, to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we need to set up the following equation:

45 = (N/64)

Solving for N, we get:

N = 45 Ã— 64 = 2880

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
