To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of permutations and combinations.

Given information:
- There are six children in each family.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births of boys (B) and girls (G) was G B G B B G.

To find the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to consider the number of possible permutations of this order.

There are 6 positions to be filled with either B or G. Since there are 5 Bs and 1 G, the number of possible permutations is:

Permutations = 6! / (5! × 1!)
Permutations = 720 / (120 × 1)
Permutations = 6

Therefore, my estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 6}
