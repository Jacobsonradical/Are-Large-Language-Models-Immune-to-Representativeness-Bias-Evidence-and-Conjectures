To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then determine the proportion of families that have the order G B G B B G. We can then apply this proportion to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are families with six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the order of births was G B G B B G.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible birth orders for six children.
There are two possibilities for each child (boy or girl), and the order matters.
Total number of possible birth orders = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2^6 = 64

Step 2: Find the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.
Proportion = Number of families with the order G B G B B G / Total number of possible birth orders
Proportion = 45 / 64

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Since the order B G B B B B is one of the possible birth orders, we can apply the same proportion to estimate its frequency.
Estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B = Proportion × Total number of possible birth orders
Estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B = (45 / 64) × 64 = 45

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.

{answer: 45}
