To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of possible birth orders for families with six children and the probability of getting the specific order B G B B B B.

Given:
- There are 6 children in each family.
- There are 2 possible outcomes for each child (boy or girl).
- The total number of possible birth orders is 2^6 = 64.

To find the probability of getting the specific order B G B B B B, we need to count the number of ways to arrange 4 boys and 2 girls, which is:
6! / (4! × 2!) = 15

Since there are 64 total possible birth orders, the probability of getting the order B G B B B B is:
Probability = 15 / 64 = 0.234375 (approximately)

Now, we need to multiply this probability by the number of families surveyed with the order G B G B B G to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

If there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, then the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 45 × 0.234375 ≈ 10.55 (approximately 11 families)}
