To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then determine the proportion of those families with the order G B G B B G. We can then use this proportion to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There were 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
- The births of boys and girls are independent events with equal probability.
- The total number of families with six children is large enough to apply probability calculations.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible orders of six children.
The total number of orders = 2^6 = 64 (since each child can be either a boy or a girl)

Step 2: Find the probability of the order G B G B B G.
The probability of G B G B B G = 1/64 (since all orders are equally likely)

Step 3: Find the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.
Proportion of families with G B G B B G = 45 / Total number of families with six children

Step 4: Find the probability of the order B G B B B B.
The probability of B G B B B B = 1/64 (since all orders are equally likely)

Step 5: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Number of families with B G B B B B = (1/64) / (45 / Total number of families with six children) Ã— 45
Number of families with B G B B B B = 45 / 64

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45/64}
