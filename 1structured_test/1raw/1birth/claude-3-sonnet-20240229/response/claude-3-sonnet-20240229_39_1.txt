To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the possible permutations of the given pattern (G B G B B G) and the symmetry of the pattern B G B B B B.

Given:
- The exact order of births in 45 families was G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B.

Step 1: Find the number of permutations of the pattern G B G B B G.
There are 6 positions, and we can arrange the 3 Bs and 3 Gs in 6! / (3! Ã— 3!) = 20 ways.

Step 2: Consider the symmetry of the pattern B G B B B B.
The pattern B G B B B B is symmetrical, meaning that there is only one way to arrange the 5 Bs and 1 G in this order.

Step 3: Assume that the ratio of families with the order G B G B B G to families with the order B G B B B B is the same as the ratio of their permutations.
Number of permutations of G B G B B G / Number of permutations of B G B B B B = 20 / 1

Step 4: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B based on the given information.
If 45 families had the order G B G B B G, and the ratio of permutations is 20:1, then the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B would be 45 / 20 = 2.25.

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 2}

Note: Since we cannot have a fractional number of families, we round down the estimate to the nearest whole number.
