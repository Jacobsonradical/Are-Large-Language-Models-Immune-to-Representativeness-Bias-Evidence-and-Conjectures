To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G. We can then use this proportion to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are families with six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible orders for six children.
There are 2 possibilities for each child (boy or girl).
Total number of possible orders = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2^6 = 64

Step 2: Calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.
Proportion of families with G B G B B G = 45 / 64

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Since there is only one order that is the reverse of G B G B B G, the proportion of families with B G B B B B should be the same as the proportion of families with G B G B B G.
Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = (45 / 64) × 64 = 45

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
