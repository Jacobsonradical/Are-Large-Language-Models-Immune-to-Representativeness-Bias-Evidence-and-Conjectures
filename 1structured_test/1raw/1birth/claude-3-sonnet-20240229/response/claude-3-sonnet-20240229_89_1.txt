To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G. We can then use this proportion to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are families with six children.
- In 45 families, the order of births is G B G B B G.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible arrangements for six children.
Total number of arrangements = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.
Number of families with the order G B G B B G = 45
Proportion of families with the order G B G B B G = 45 / 720 = 1 / 16

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Since there are six children and the order is B G B B B B, there is only one arrangement for this order.
Proportion of families with the order B G B B B B = 1 / 720

Step 4: Compare the proportions to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Proportion of families with the order G B G B B G / Proportion of families with the order B G B B B B = 16

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B is approximately 45 / 16 = 2.8125 ≈ 3.
