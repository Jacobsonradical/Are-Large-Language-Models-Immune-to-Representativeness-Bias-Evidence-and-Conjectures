To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of having this specific birth order and the total number of families surveyed.

Given information:
- The city surveyed all families with six children.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the gender of each child is an independent event with a probability of 0.5 for a boy or a girl, the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since we know that there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed.

Let's denote the total number of families surveyed as N.

The probability of having the birth order G B G B B G is also 1/64.

Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

45/N = 1/64

Solving for N, we get:

N = 45 × 64 = 2,880

If the total number of families surveyed is 2,880, and the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is 1/64, then the estimated number of families with this birth order would be:

2,880 × (1/64) = 45

Therefore, your estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
