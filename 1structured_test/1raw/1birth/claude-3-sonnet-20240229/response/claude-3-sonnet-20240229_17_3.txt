To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the symmetry and similarities between the two birth order patterns.

Given:
- The order G B G B B G appears in 45 families.
- We want to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Since the two orders are mirror images of each other, we can assume that they would occur with similar frequencies in the population.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{answer: 45}
