To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the following:

1. There are 6 possible positions for the single girl (G) in the birth order B G B B B B.
2. The remaining 5 positions are occupied by boys (B).
3. The total number of families with 6 children is not given, but we know that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G.

Assuming that all possible birth orders of boys and girls are equally likely, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

Let's denote the total number of families surveyed as N.
Since there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, and there are 6 possible positions for the single girl in this birth order, we can estimate that:

45 = N × (1/6)

Rearranging the equation, we get:

N = 45 × 6 = 270

Now, to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to consider that there are also 6 possible positions for the single girl in this birth order.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

270 × (1/6) = 45

{answer: 45}
