To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G. This proportion can then be used to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- The survey was conducted on all families with six children in the city.
- There were 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible orders for six children.
Total number of orders = 2^6 = 64 (since there are two possible outcomes, boy or girl, for each child)

Step 2: Calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.
Proportion of families with order G B G B B G = 45 / 64

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Since the orders G B G B B G and B G B B B B are opposite, their proportions should be the same.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B = 45 / 64 Ã— 64 = 45

{answer: 45}
