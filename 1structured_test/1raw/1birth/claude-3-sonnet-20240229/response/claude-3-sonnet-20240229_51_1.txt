To solve this problem, we need to make some assumptions about the distribution of births and the independence of each child's gender.

Assuming that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl (0.5 for each), and that the gender of each child is independent of the others, we can calculate the probability of having the exact order of births B G B B B B.

The probability of having the order B G B B B B is:
P(B) × P(G) × P(B) × P(B) × P(B) × P(B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 or approximately 1.56%

If we assume that the number of families surveyed is large enough, we can use this probability to estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B.

Since we know that there were 45 families with the exact order G B G B B G, and assuming that the probabilities of different birth orders are equal, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

Number of families with order B G B B B B = (45 × 0.015625) / 0.015625 = 45

Therefore, my estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
