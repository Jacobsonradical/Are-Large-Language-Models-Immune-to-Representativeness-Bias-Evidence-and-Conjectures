To solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

1. The total number of families with six children.
2. The number of ways to arrange 3 boys and 3 girls in a specific order.
3. The probability of having the order G B G B B G.
4. The probability of having the order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of families with six children.
Number of ways to arrange 3 boys and 3 girls = 6! / (3! × 3!) = 20

Step 2: Calculate the probability of having the order G B G B B G.
Probability of G B G B B G = 1 / 20

Step 3: Calculate the number of families with the order G B G B B G.
Number of families with G B G B B G = 45

Step 4: Calculate the total number of families surveyed.
Total number of families surveyed = Number of families with G B G B B G / Probability of G B G B B G
Total number of families surveyed = 45 / (1 / 20) = 900

Step 5: Calculate the probability of having the order B G B B B B.
Probability of B G B B B B = 1 / 20

Step 6: Calculate the estimate of the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Estimate of the number of families with B G B B B B = Total number of families surveyed × Probability of B G B B B B
Estimate of the number of families with B G B B B B = 900 × (1 / 20) = 45

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
