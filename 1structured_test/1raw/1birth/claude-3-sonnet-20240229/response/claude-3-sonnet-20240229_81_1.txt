To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families with six children and the probability of having the specific order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- The survey included all families with six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming an equal probability of having a boy or a girl for each birth, the probability of having the order B G B B B B is:

Probability of B G B B B B = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since we know that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, and there are 6! = 720 possible orders for six children, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as:

Total families surveyed = (45 × 720) / 6 = 5,400

Now, to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we multiply the total number of families by the probability of having that order:

Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = 5,400 × (1/64) ≈ 84

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 84}
