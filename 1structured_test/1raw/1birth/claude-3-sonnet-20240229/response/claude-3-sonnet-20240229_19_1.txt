To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to consider the following:

1. The question states that there were 45 families with the exact order G B G B B G.
2. Assuming an equal probability of having a boy or a girl for each birth, the probability of having the order G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.
3. Similarly, the probability of having the order B G B B B B is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64.
4. Since the probabilities are the same, we can expect an equal number of families with the order B G B B B B as with the order G B G B B G.

Therefore, my estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
