To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this birth order occurring and the total number of families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are families of six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
- The gender of each child is independent and has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided, but we can infer it from the given information.

Since there are six children in each family, and the order of births is G B G B B G in 45 families, we can calculate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

Probability of the birth order G B G B B G = (1/2)^6 = 1/64 (since each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl)
Number of families with the birth order G B G B B G = 45

If we assume that the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is the same as the probability of the birth order G B G B B G, then we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

Probability of the birth order B G B B B B = (1/2)^6 = 1/64
Number of families with the birth order B G B B B B = (Number of families with the birth order G B G B B G) / (Probability of the birth order G B G B B G) × (Probability of the birth order B G B B B B)
Number of families with the birth order B G B B B B = 45 / (1/64) × (1/64) = 45

Therefore, your estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
