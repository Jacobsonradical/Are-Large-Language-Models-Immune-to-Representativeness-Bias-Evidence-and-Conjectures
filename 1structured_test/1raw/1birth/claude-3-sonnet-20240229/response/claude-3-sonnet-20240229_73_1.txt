To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to consider the following:

1. The order G B G B B G is given, which means that the first child is a girl, the second is a boy, the third is a girl, the fourth is a boy, the fifth is a boy, and the sixth is a girl.
2. For the order B G B B B B, we have the reverse scenario, where the first child is a boy, the second is a girl, the third is a boy, and the remaining three children are boys.
3. Since the order of births is the reverse of the given order, we can assume that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is likely to be similar to the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B would be:
