To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then determine the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G. We can then use this proportion to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are families with six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births of boys (B) and girls (G) was G B G B B G.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible arrangements of six children with different genders.
Total number of arrangements = 6! / (3! × 3!) = 20

Step 2: Calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.
Proportion = Number of families with the order G B G B B G / Total number of arrangements
Proportion = 45 / 20 = 2.25 / 20 = 0.1125

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Since the order B G B B B B is the opposite of G B G B B G, the proportion should be the same.
Estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B = 0.1125 × 20 = 2.25

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
