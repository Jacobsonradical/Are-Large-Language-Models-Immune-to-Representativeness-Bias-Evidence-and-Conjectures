To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The births of boys and girls are independent events, and each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl.
2. The order of births is equally likely for all possible combinations.

Given:
- There are 45 families with the order G B G B B G.
- The total number of families with six children is unknown.

Since there are 6 positions for the children, and each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), the total number of possible birth orders is 2^6 = 64.

The order B G B B B B is one of these 64 possible orders.

If we assume that all birth orders are equally likely, then the number of families with the order B G B B B B should be approximately equal to the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B is:
