To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then determine the proportion of families with the order GBGBBG. We can then use this proportion to estimate the number of families with the order BGBBBB.

Given information:
- There are families with six children.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was GBGBBG.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible birth orders for six children.
There are two possible outcomes for each child (boy or girl).
Total number of possible birth orders = 2^6 = 64

Step 2: Calculate the proportion of families with the order GBGBBG.
Proportion of families with the order GBGBBG = 45 / 64

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the order BGBBBB.
There are 6 possible orders with the pattern BGBBBB (BGBBBB, BBBBBG, BBBBGB, BBBGBB, BGBBBB, BBGBBB).
Estimated number of families with the order BGBBBB = (6 / 64) × (Total number of families surveyed)

Since we don't know the total number of families surveyed, we can express the answer as a proportion:

{answer: (6 / 64) × (45 / 64) × (Total number of families surveyed)}
