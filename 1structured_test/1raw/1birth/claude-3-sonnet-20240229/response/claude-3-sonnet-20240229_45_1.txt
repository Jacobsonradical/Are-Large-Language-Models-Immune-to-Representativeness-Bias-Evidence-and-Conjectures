To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

Assumptions:
- The births of boys and girls are independent events.
- The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).
- The survey covers all families with six children in the city.

Given:
- There are 45 families with the order of births G B G B B G.

The probability of having the order G B G B B G is:
(1/2)^6 = 1/64 (since there are 6 births, and each has a probability of 1/2)

Similarly, the probability of having the order B G B B B B is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

If the probabilities are equal, and the survey covers all families with six children, we can assume that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is also 45.

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families with the order of births B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
