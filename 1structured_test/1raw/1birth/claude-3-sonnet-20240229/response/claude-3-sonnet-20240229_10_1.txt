To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

Assumptions:
- The survey covered all families with exactly six children in the city.
- The order of births is equally likely for all possible combinations of boys (B) and girls (G).
- The families with the order G B G B B G are a subset of the surveyed families.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

Since there are 6 children in each family, there are 2^6 = 64 possible combinations of boys and girls.

If we assume that all combinations are equally likely, the probability of having the order B G B B B B is 1/64.

Let's denote the total number of families surveyed as N.

The number of families with the order B G B B B B should be (1/64) × N.

We know that the number of families with the order G B G B B G is 45.

Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
(1/64) × N = 45

Solving for N, we get:
N = 45 × 64 = 2880

{answer: 2880}

Note: This is an estimate based on the assumption that all combinations are equally likely. In reality, the distribution of birth orders may not be uniform, and this estimate could be inaccurate.
