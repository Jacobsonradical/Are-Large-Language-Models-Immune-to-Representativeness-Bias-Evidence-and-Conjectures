To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G. We can then use this proportion to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are families with six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births of boys (B) and girls (G) was G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
- The order of births is equally likely for all possible combinations of boys and girls.
- The total number of families with six children is not given, but we can calculate it based on the given information.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible orders for six children.
Total number of possible orders = 6! (6 factorial) = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Find the number of orders with the pattern G B G B B G.
Number of orders with G B G B B G = 6C3 = 6!/(3!×3!) = 20
(There are 3 ways to choose the positions of the girls, and the remaining 3 positions are for the boys.)

Step 3: Calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.
Proportion of families with G B G B B G = 45 / (720 / 20) = 45 / 36 = 1.25

Step 4: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Number of orders with B G B B B B = 6C1 = 6
Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = 1.25 × 6 = 7.5

Therefore, your estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 8}

Note: Since we cannot have a fractional number of families, we round up the estimate of 7.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 8.
