To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of possible birth orders for families with six children and assume that all birth orders are equally likely.

For six children, there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders, since each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G).

The specific order G B G B B G appears once among these 64 possibilities.

Assuming that all birth orders are equally likely, we can estimate that the birth order B G B B B B should also appear once among the 64 possibilities.

Therefore, my estimate for the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B is:
