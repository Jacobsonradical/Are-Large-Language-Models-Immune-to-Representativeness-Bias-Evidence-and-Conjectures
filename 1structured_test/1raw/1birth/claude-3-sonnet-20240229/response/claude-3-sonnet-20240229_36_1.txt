To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the information provided about families with the order G B G B B G.

Assuming that the gender of children is equally likely (i.e., the probability of having a boy or a girl is the same), we can use the principle of symmetry. If there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, then we would expect the same number of families with the reverse order B G B G G B.

Since the question asks about the order B G B B B B, we can consider this as a rearrangement of the order B G B G G B by swapping the last two positions.

There are 6 choose 2 = 15 ways to choose the positions to swap in an order of 6 elements. Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as:

45 Ã— (1/15) = 3

Therefore, my estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 3}
