To solve this problem, we need to find the number of possible permutations of six children with three boys and three girls, and then divide it by the number of permutations corresponding to the given order (G B G B B G) to find the ratio. This ratio can then be multiplied by the given number of families (45) to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- Total number of children = 6
- Number of boys = 3
- Number of girls = 3
- Number of families with the order G B G B B G = 45

Step 1: Find the number of permutations of six children with three boys and three girls.
Number of permutations = 6! / (3! × 3!) = 720 / (6 × 6) = 20

Step 2: Find the number of permutations corresponding to the order G B G B B G.
There is only one permutation for this order.

Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the number of families with the order B G B B B B to the number of families with the order G B G B B G.
Ratio = Number of permutations for B G B B B B / Number of permutations for G B G B B G
Ratio = 1 / 1 = 1

Step 4: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Estimated number of families = Ratio × Number of families with the order G B G B B G
Estimated number of families = 1 × 45 = 45

Therefore, your estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
