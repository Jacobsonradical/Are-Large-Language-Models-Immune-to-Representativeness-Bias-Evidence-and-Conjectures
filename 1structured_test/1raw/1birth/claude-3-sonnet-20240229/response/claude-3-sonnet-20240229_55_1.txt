To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The birth order is equally likely for any combination of boys and girls.
2. The number of families with a specific birth order is independent of other birth orders.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G.

Since there are 6 children in each family, there are 6! = 720 possible birth orders. If we assume that all birth orders are equally likely, then the probability of any specific birth order is 1/720.

The order B G B B B B is one of the 720 possible birth orders. Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with this birth order by taking the same proportion as the given order G B G B B G.

Estimate = (45 / 720) Ã— 720 = 45

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:
