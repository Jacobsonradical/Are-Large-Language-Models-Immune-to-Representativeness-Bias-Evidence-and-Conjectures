To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of families with six children and then calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G. We can then use this proportion to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- The survey was conducted on all families with six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible orders of six children.
The total number of possible orders = 2^6 = 64 (since there are two possibilities, boy or girl, for each of the six children)

Step 2: Calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.
Proportion of families with the order G B G B B G = 45 / 64

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Since the order B G B B B B is the reverse of G B G B B G, the proportion of families with this order should be the same as the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B = 45 / 64 Ã— 64 = 45

{answer: 45}
