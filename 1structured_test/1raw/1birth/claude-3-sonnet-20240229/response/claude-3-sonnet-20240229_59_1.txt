To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible orders of births for families with six children and the given condition that the order G B G B B G occurred in 45 families.

Assuming that the gender of each child is equally likely (50% chance of being a boy or a girl), and the births are independent events, we can calculate the probability of the order B G B B B B as follows:

Total possible orders for 6 children = 2^6 = 64 (since each child can be either a boy or a girl)
Probability of the order B G B B B B = 1/64 (there is only one such order out of the 64 possible orders)

Now, we know that the order G B G B B G occurred in 45 families. If we assume that the orders are equally likely, then the number of families with the order B G B B B B should be proportional to its probability (1/64) compared to the order G B G B B G (1/64).

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

(1/64) / (1/64) Ã— 45 = 45

So, the answer in the requested format is:

{answer: 45}
