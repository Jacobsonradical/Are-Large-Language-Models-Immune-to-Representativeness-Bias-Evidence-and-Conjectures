To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible arrangements of boys (B) and girls (G) in a family of six children.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G.

We want to find the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

Since there are only two possible outcomes for each child (boy or girl), and the order matters, we can use the multiplication principle to calculate the total number of possible arrangements.

Total number of possible arrangements = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 64

Now, we need to find the number of arrangements that follow the pattern B G B B B B.

There is only one way to arrange B G B B B B, so the count is 1.

Assuming that the births are equally likely, the probability of having the order B G B B B B is:
Probability = 1 / 64

Since there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can use the same probability to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Estimated number of families with order B G B B B B = 45 × (1 / 64)
