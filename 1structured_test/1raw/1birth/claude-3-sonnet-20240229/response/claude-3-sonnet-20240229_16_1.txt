To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then determine the proportion of families with the birth order G B G B B G. This proportion can be used to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are families with six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible birth orders for six children.
There are two possible outcomes for each child (boy or girl).
Total number of possible birth orders = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2^6 = 64

Step 2: Calculate the proportion of families with the birth order G B G B B G.
Proportion of families with the birth order G B G B B G = 45 / 64

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
Since there is only one possible birth order with six boys, the proportion of families with the birth order B G B B B B should be the same as the proportion of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B = (45 / 64) × 64 = 45

{answer: 45}
