To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the possible permutations of the given pattern (G B G B B G) and the number of ways to rearrange the letters to get the desired pattern (B G B B B B).

Given information:
- The exact order of births in 45 families was G B G B B G.
- We want to find the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B.

There are 6! = 720 possible permutations of the pattern G B G B B G.

To get the pattern B G B B B B, we need to rearrange the letters in G B G B B G by moving the first G to the end and the second B to the beginning.

The number of ways to rearrange the letters to get B G B B B B is:
Number of ways to choose the first G = 6 (choose any of the 6 letters)
Number of ways to choose the second B = 5 (choose any of the remaining 5 letters)

Total number of ways = 6 × 5 = 30

Since there are 720 possible permutations of G B G B B G, and 30 of them lead to B G B B B B, the probability of getting B G B B B B is 30/720 = 1/24.

Given that there were 45 families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B by multiplying 45 by the probability 1/24.

Estimated number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B = 45 × (1/24) = 1.875 ≈ 2

Therefore, your estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
