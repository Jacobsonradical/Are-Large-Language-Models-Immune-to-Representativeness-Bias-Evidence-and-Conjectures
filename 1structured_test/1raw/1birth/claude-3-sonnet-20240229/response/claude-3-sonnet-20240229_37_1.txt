To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then calculate the proportion of families with the given birth order (G B G B B G). We can then use this proportion to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- The survey was conducted on families with six children.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible birth orders for six children.
There are 2 possible outcomes (boy or girl) for each child, and there are 6 children.
Total number of possible birth orders = 2^6 = 64

Step 2: Calculate the proportion of families with the birth order G B G B B G.
Proportion = Number of families with the birth order G B G B B G / Total number of possible birth orders
Proportion = 45 / 64

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
Since there is only one possible birth order with all boys, the proportion of families with the birth order B G B B B B should be the same as the proportion calculated in Step 2.

Estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B = Proportion × Total number of possible birth orders
Estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B = (45 / 64) × 64 = 45

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
