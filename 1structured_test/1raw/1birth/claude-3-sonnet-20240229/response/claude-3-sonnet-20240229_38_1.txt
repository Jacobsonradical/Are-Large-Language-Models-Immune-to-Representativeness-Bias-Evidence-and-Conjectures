To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, I need to make some assumptions and use the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The birth order of boys and girls is random and independent for each family.
2. The total number of families with six children is much larger than the number of families with the specific order G B G B B G.

Given information:
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Since there are 6 children in each family, the total number of possible birth order combinations is 2^6 = 64.

The probability of having the order G B G B B G is 1/64 (assuming random birth order).

If the number of families with the order G B G B B G is 45, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of getting that specific order:

Total number of families surveyed ≈ 45 / (1/64) = 2880

Now, to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we need to find the probability of that specific order, which is also 1/64.

Number of families with order B G B B B B ≈ 2880 * (1/64) = 45

Therefore, my estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
