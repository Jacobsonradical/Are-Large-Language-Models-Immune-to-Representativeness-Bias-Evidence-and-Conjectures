To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The order of births is random and follows the laws of probability.
2. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5).
3. The births are independent events.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G.

Since the order of births is random, we can assume that the probability of having any specific order of births is the same. Therefore, the probability of having the order G B G B B G is the same as the probability of having the order B G B B B B.

The probability of having a specific order of births with three boys and three girls is (0.5)^6 = 1/64.

If there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and the probability of having any specific order is the same, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B to be approximately 45.

Therefore, the answer would be:

{answer: 45}
