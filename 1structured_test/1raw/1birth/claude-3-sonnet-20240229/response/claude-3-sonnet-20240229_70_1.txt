To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families with six children and the probability of having that specific order of births.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G.
- The total number of possible birth orders for six children is 2^6 = 64 (since each child can be either a boy or a girl).

Assuming that all birth orders are equally likely, the probability of having the order B G B B B B is 1/64.

Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by multiplying the total number of families with six children by the probability of having that specific order.

Let's assume there are N families with six children in the city.

Number of families with the order B G B B B B = N × (1/64)

Since we know that there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can substitute this value and solve for N.

45 = N × (1/64)
N = 45 × 64
N = 2880

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
