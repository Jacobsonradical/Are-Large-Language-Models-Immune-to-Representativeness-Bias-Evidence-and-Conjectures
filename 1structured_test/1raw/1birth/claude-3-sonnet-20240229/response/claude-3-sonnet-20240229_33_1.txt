To estimate the number of families surveyed with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and simplifications based on the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The order of births is equally likely for any combination of boys and girls.
2. The total number of families with six children is large enough to apply probability calculations.

Given:
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- There are 6 children in each family.

Since there are 6 children in each family, there are 2^6 = 64 possible combinations of boys and girls.

The probability of having the order G B G B B G is 1/64, as there is one favorable outcome out of 64 equally likely outcomes.

Similarly, the probability of having the order B G B B B B is also 1/64.

If the number of families with the order G B G B B G is 45, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by maintaining the same probability ratio.

Let x be the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B.

(x / 45) = (1 / 64) / (1 / 64)
x = 45

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
