To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to consider the following:

1. The given information tells us about families with 6 children and the birth order G B G B B G.
2. We want to find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, which is the opposite of the given order.
3. Since the birth order can be considered a random event, we can assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).
4. The probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 or approximately 1.56%.

Therefore, if we assume that the birth orders are equally likely, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

{answer: 45 * 0.015625 = 0.703125 â‰ˆ 1}
