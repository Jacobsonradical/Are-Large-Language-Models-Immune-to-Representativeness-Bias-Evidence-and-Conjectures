To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The order of births is independent of the family, meaning that each family has an equal probability of having any particular order of births.
2. The gender of a child is independent of the genders of the other children in the family.
3. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).

Given:
- There are 45 families with the order G B G B B G.
- The total number of families with six children is unknown.

Since the order G B G B B G has a probability of (0.5)^6 = 0.015625 (assuming equal probability for boys and girls), we can estimate the total number of families by dividing 45 by 0.015625.

Total number of families ≈ 45 / 0.015625 = 2880

Now, to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we need to calculate the probability of this order occurring.
Probability of B G B B B B = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B would be:
Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = 2880 × 0.015625 ≈ 45

{answer: 45}
