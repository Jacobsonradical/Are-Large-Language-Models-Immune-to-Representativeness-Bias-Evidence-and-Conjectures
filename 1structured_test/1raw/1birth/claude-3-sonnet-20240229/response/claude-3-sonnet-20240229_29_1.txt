To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of having this particular birth order and the total number of families with six children.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G.
- The order of births is considered, so the combinations are not the same as the combinations of 3 boys and 3 girls.

Assuming an equal probability for each birth order, we can calculate the probability of having the order B G B B B B as follows:

Total number of possible birth orders with 3 boys and 3 girls = 6! / (3! Ã— 3!) = 20
Probability of having the order B G B B B B = 1/20

Since there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and the probability of having B G B B B B is the same, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B to be the same as those with G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
