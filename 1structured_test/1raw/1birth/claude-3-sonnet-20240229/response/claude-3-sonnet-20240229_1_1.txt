To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The order of births is independent of the family.
2. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).
3. The total number of families with six children is unknown, but we can use the given information to estimate it.

Given:
- There are 45 families with the order of births G B G B B G.
- The total number of possible orders for six children is 2^6 = 64.

Since the order G B G B B G has a probability of 1/64 (assuming equal probability for each order), and we observed 45 families with this order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as:

Total number of families = (45 × 64) / 1 = 2880

Now, to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we need to find the probability of this order occurring.

Probability of the order B G B B B B = 1/64 (since there are 64 possible orders, and each order is equally likely)

Number of families with the order B G B B B B = Total number of families × Probability of the order B G B B B B
Number of families with the order B G B B B B = 2880 × (1/64) = 45

Therefore, your estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
