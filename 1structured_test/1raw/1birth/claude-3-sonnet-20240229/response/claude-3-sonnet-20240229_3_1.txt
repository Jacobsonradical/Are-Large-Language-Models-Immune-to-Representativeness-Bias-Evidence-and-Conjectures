To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families with six children and the probability of having that specific order of births.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the order of births G B G B B G.
- The total number of possible orders of births for six children is 2^6 = 64 (since each child can be either a boy or a girl).

Assuming that all orders of births are equally likely, the probability of having the order G B G B B G is 45/64.

By symmetry, the probability of having the order B G B B B B should also be 45/64 (since the order of births is simply reversed, and the probability depends only on the number of boys and girls, not their order).

Therefore, if there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that there should also be approximately 45 families with the order B G B B B B.

{answer: 45}
