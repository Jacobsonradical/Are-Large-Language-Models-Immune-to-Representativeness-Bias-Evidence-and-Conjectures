To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families with six children and the likelihood of the specific birth order.

Given information:
- The survey covered all families with six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
- The births of boys and girls are independent and equally likely events.
- The order of births is not influenced by the gender of the previous child(ren).

Since there are two possible outcomes (boy or girl) for each birth, and the order matters, the total number of possible birth orders for six children is 2^6 = 64.

Out of these 64 possible birth orders, there is only one order that matches B G B B B B.

If the births of boys and girls are equally likely, and the order of births is not influenced by the gender of the previous child(ren), then the probability of getting the birth order B G B B B B is 1/64.

Since we know that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, we can assume that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45 (assuming equal probabilities).

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
