To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- The survey was conducted for all families with six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible orders for six children.
There are two possibilities for each child (boy or girl), and the order matters.
Total number of possible orders = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2^6 = 64

Step 2: Calculate the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.
Proportion of families with the order G B G B B G = 45 / 64

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
The order B G B B B B is the reverse of G B G B B G.
Since the total number of families is the same, the proportion of families with the order B G B B B B should also be the same as the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B = 45 / 64 × 64 = 45

{answer: 45}
