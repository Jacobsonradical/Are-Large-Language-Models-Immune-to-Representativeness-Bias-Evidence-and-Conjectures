To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the possible permutations of boys and girls in a family of six children and the probability of each permutation occurring.

Given information:
- The city surveyed all families with six children.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assumption:
- The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).
- The births are independent events.

There are 2^6 = 64 possible permutations of boys and girls in a family of six children.
The permutation B G B B B B is one of these 64 possibilities.

The probability of having the permutation B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 1/64, since each birth has a 0.5 probability of being a boy or a girl, and there are six independent events.

If we denote the total number of families surveyed as N, we can estimate the number of families with the permutation B G B B B B as follows:

Number of families with the permutation B G B B B B = N × (1/64)

Since we know that there are 45 families with the permutation G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed (N):

45 = N × (6/64)
N = 45 × (64/6) = 480

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the permutation B G B B B B is:

480 × (1/64) = 7.5

{answer: 7.5}
