To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the following:

1. The total number of families with six children is unknown.
2. We know that in 45 families, the order of births was G B G B B G.
3. The order B G B B B B is just the reverse of G B G B B G.

Assuming that the order of births is equally likely to be G B G B B G or B G B B B B, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B to be the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G, which is 45.

Therefore, my estimate is:

{answer: 45}
