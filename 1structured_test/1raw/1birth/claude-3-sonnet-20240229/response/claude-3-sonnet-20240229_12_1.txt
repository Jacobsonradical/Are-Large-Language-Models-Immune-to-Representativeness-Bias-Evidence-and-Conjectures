To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The order of births is independent of the family size.
2. The birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely (assuming a balanced gender ratio).

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the order G B G B B G.
- The total number of families with six children is unknown.

Since there are two possible outcomes for each birth (boy or girl), and the order is independent of the family size, the probability of getting any specific order of six births is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

The probability of getting the order G B G B B G is also 1/64.

If we assume that the total number of families with six children is large enough, the number of families with the order G B G B B G should be approximately proportional to its probability.

Therefore, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B to be the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G, which is 45.
