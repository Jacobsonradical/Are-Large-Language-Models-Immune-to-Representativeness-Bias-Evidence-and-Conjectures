To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

The given order G B G B B G appears to be a specific pattern, and it's reasonable to assume that other patterns are equally likely to occur. Since there are 6 children in each family, there are 2^6 = 64 possible combinations of boys and girls.

Out of these 64 combinations, there is only one combination that matches the pattern B G B B B B.

If we assume that all patterns are equally likely, then the probability of a family having the order B G B B B B is 1/64.

To estimate the number of families with this order, we can multiply the probability by the total number of families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

Assuming that the total number of families surveyed is proportional to the number of families with the given order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as:

Total families surveyed ≈ 45 × 64 = 2,880

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B would be:

Number of families with order B G B B B B ≈ 2,880 × (1/64) = 45
