To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families with six children and the probability of having the specific order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- The survey included all families with six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
- The gender of a child is an independent event with an equal probability (0.5) of being a boy or a girl.
- The order of births is equally likely for all possible combinations.

The probability of having the order B G B B B B in a family with six children is:
P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 1/64

Since the survey included all families with six children, the number of families with the order B G B B B B should be proportional to the probability of this event occurring.

If there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, then the number of families with the order B G B B B B can be estimated as:

Number of families with B G B B B B = (45 / P(G B G B B G)) × P(B G B B B B)
Number of families with B G B B B B = (45 / (0.5)^6) × (0.5)^6
Number of families with B G B B B B = 45

Therefore, your estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
