To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The order of births is random, and the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).
2. The number of families with the order G B G B B G is representative of the total number of families with six children.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

Since the order of births is assumed to be random, the probability of having any specific order of births is the same. Therefore, the number of families with the order B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
