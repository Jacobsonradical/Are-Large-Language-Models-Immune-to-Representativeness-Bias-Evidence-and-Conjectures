To estimate the number of families surveyed with the order of births B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and calculations based on the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The gender of each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl.
2. The birth order of children within a family is independent of other families.
3. All families in the city with six children were surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Since the gender of each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, the probability of having a specific birth order, such as G B G B B G, is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Similarly, the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Assuming that the number of families with different birth orders is proportional to their respective probabilities, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

(Number of families with B G B B B B) / (Number of families with G B G B B G) = (1/64) / (1/64) = 1

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is approximately equal to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, which is 45.
