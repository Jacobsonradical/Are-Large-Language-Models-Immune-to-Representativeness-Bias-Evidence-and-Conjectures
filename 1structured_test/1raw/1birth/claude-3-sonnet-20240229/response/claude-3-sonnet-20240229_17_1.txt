To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then determine how many of them have the birth order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumption:
- The birth order of boys and girls is equally likely for families with six children.

Since there are 6 children in each family, and each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), the total number of possible birth orders is 2^6 = 64.

If the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely, then each birth order should have the same probability of occurring.

Therefore, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, which is 45.
