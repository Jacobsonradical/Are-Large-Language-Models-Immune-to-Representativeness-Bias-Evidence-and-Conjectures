To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make a few assumptions and calculations based on the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The birth order of boys and girls in a family of six children is equally likely.
2. The given order G B G B B G represents one of the possible orders.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the order G B G B B G.
- There are 6! = 720 possible orders for six children (assuming no twins).

Since there is only one specific order given (G B G B B G), we can assume that each possible order is equally likely. Therefore, the number of families with the order B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G, which is 45.
