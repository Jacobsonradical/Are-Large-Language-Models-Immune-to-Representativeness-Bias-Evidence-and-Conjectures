To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

Assumptions:
- The order of births is randomly distributed among families.
- The probability of having a boy or a girl for each birth is equal (0.5 each).

Given:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G.

Since the order of births is assumed to be randomly distributed, we can calculate the probability of having the order B G B B B B as follows:

Probability of having the order B G B B B B = (0.5)^6 = 1/64 (since there are 6 births and each birth has a 0.5 probability of being a boy or a girl)

If there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and the probability of having the order B G B B B B is 1/64, then we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as:

Estimated number of families with order B G B B B B = (45 / (1/64)) = 45 * 64 = 2,880

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 2,880}
