To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to consider the following:

1. The total number of families with six children is unknown, but the information about the 45 families with the order G B G B B G is given.
2. Since the order of births is specific, we can assume that the probability of having a specific order is equally likely for all possible orders.
3. There are 2^6 = 64 possible orders of births for six children (each child can be either a boy or a girl).
4. The order B G B B B B is one of these 64 possible orders.

Since the probability of having any specific order is equally likely, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by scaling the given 45 families proportionally.

{answer: 45 * (1/64) â‰ˆ 0.7}

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is approximately 0.7.
