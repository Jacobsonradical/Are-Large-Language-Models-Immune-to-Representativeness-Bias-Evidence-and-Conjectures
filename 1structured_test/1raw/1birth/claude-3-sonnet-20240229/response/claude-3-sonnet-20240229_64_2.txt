To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible arrangements of boys (B) and girls (G) in families with six children.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
- All families have six children.
- The order of births matters (G B G B B G is different from G B B G B G).
- There are no other restrictions on the order of births.

Since there are six children in each family, and each child can be either a boy or a girl, there are 2^6 = 64 possible arrangements of boys and girls in each family.

Out of these 64 possible arrangements, there is only one arrangement that has the exact order B G B B B B.

If the survey included all possible families of six children in the city, and there were no biases or preferences for certain birth orders, we can assume that the families are distributed uniformly among the 64 possible arrangements.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 45 / 64}

This is based on the assumption that the ratio of families with the order G B G B B G to the total number of families is the same as the ratio of families with the order B G B B B B to the total number of families.
