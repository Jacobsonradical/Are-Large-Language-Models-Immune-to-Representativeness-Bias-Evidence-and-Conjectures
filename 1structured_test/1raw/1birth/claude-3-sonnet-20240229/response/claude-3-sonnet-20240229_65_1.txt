To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the possible orders of births for families with six children.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
- The survey covered all families with six children in the city.
- The gender of a child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl (assuming no external factors).
- The order of births is independent of gender.

Since there are 6 children in each family, there are 2^6 = 64 possible orders of births, considering each child as either a boy (B) or a girl (G).

The order B G B B B B is one of the 64 possible orders.

If we assume that all orders are equally likely, then the probability of getting the order B G B B B B is 1/64.

To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can multiply the probability (1/64) by the total number of families surveyed.

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is N.

Number of families with the order B G B B B B = (1/64) × N

Since we know that there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can set up the following equation:

N = 45 × 64 (because the order G B G B B G has a probability of 1/64 among the 64 possible orders)

Solving for N, we get:
N = 2880

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B is:
(1/64) × 2880 = 45

{answer: 45}
