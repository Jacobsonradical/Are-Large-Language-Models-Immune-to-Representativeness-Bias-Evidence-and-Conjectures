To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The order of births is independent of the family.
2. Boys and girls are equally likely to be born.
3. The total number of families surveyed is large enough for the observed pattern (G B G B B G) to be representative.

Given that the order G B G B B G was observed in 45 families, we can assume that the probability of this order occurring is 45/N, where N is the total number of families surveyed.

Similarly, the probability of the order B G B B B B occurring would be the same as the probability of the order G B G B B G, since boys and girls are equally likely to be born.

Therefore, the expected number of families with the order B G B B B B would also be 45/N Ã— N = 45.
