To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the given information and make some assumptions.

Given information:
- The survey was conducted on all families with six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
- The births of boys and girls are independent events with equal probability (assuming no external factors affecting the gender ratio).
- The order of births is equally likely for all possible orders.

Since there are six children in each family, there are 2^6 = 64 possible orders of births (each child can be either a boy or a girl).

Out of these 64 possible orders, there is only one order where the exact order of births is B G B B B B.

If the order of births is equally likely for all possible orders, then the probability of having the exact order B G B B B B is 1/64.

To estimate the number of families with this order, we multiply the probability by the total number of families surveyed.

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is N.

Number of families with the order B G B B B B = N × (1/64)

We don't know the value of N, but we can use the given information about the 45 families with the order G B G B B G to estimate N.

The probability of having the order G B G B B G is also 1/64.

Therefore, we can write:
45 = N × (1/64)
N = 45 × 64 = 2880

Substituting the value of N in the previous equation, we get:

Number of families with the order B G B B B B = 2880 × (1/64) = 45

{answer: 45}
