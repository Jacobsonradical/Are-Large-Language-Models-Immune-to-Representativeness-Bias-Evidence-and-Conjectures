To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the possible permutations of the given pattern G B G B B G.

There are 6! = 720 ways to arrange the six birth orders. However, since there are three Bs and two Gs, we need to account for the indistinguishability of the Bs and the Gs.

The number of ways to arrange the three Bs is 3! = 6.
The number of ways to arrange the two Gs is 2! = 2.

Therefore, the total number of permutations of G B G B B G is:
720 / (6 * 2) = 60

Assuming that all permutations are equally likely, and since there are 45 families with the exact order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

There are 6 possible permutations of B G B B B B.
The ratio of families with the order B G B B B B to families with the order G B G B B G is 6/60 = 1/10.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B is:
45 * (1/10) = 4.5
