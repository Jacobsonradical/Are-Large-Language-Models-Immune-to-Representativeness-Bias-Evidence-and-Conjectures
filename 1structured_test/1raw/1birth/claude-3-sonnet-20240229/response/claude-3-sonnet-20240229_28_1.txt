To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of possible orders of six children with three boys and three girls.

The total number of possible orders is given by:

Number of possible orders = 6! / (3! × 3!) = 720 / (6 × 6) = 20

Now, we know that in 45 families, the order was G B G B B G. Since the order of births is random and there is no specific reason for one order to be more likely than another, we can assume that each of the 20 possible orders is equally likely.

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45 / 20 = 2.25}
