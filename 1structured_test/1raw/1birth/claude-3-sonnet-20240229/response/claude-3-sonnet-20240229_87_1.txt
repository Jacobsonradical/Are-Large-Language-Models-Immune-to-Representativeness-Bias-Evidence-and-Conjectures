To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to consider the following:

1. There are 6 possible permutations of the birth order for 3 boys and 3 girls: B B B G G G, B B G B G G, B B G G B G, B G B B G G, B G B G B G, and B G G B B G.
2. In the given data, the order G B G B B G occurs 45 times.
3. Assuming that all permutations are equally likely, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by comparing it to the known count of 45 for G B G B B G.

Since there are 6 possible permutations, and we know the count for one of them (45), we can estimate the count for the other permutations by dividing 45 by 6 (assuming equal likelihood).

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 45 / 6 = 7.5}

Note that this is an estimate based on the assumption of equal likelihood for all permutations. The actual number may vary from this estimate.
