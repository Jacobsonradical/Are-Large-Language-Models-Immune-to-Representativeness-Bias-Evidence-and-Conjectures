To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families with six children and the probability of having that specific order of births.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G.
- There are 6 children in each family.

Assuming an equal probability of having a boy or a girl for each birth, the probability of having the order G B G B B G is:
P(G B G B B G) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Similarly, the probability of having the order B G B B B B is also:
P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and the probabilities of both orders are equal, we can estimate that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is also 45.

Therefore, the answer is:

{answer: 45}
