To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families with six children and the probability of having that specific birth order.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- The total number of possible birth orders for six children is 2^6 = 64 (each child can be either a boy or a girl).

Assuming that all birth orders are equally likely, the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is 1/64.

Since there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B by considering the ratio of their probabilities.

Probability of G B G B B G = 1/64
Probability of B G B B B B = 1/64

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B should be equal to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.
