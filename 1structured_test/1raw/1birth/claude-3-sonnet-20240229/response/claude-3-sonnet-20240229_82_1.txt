To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific birth order occurring and the total number of families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are families with six children.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the gender of each child is an independent event with an equal probability of being a boy or a girl (0.5 for each), the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 1/64

Since we know that there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, and the total number of possible birth orders for six children is 2^6 = 64, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by scaling up the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Total number of families surveyed â‰ˆ (45 / (1/64)) = 2,880

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
