To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and consider the probabilities of different birth order patterns.

Given information:
- There are families with six children.
- The order of births for 45 families was G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
- The birth order of boys and girls is random and independent for each family.
- The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).

Since there are six children in each family, the total number of possible birth order patterns is 2^6 = 64.

The probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 1/64, because each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl, and the order is independent.

If we assume that the 45 families with the order G B G B B G are the only ones with that specific order, then the remaining 19 families (64 - 45 = 19) should have other birth order patterns, including B G B B B B.

Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 3}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the birth order patterns are equally likely and independent, and that the 45 families with the order G B G B B G are the only ones with that specific order.
