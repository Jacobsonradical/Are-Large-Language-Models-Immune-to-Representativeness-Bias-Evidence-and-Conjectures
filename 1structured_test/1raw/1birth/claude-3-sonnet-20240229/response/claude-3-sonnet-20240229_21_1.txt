To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information.

Given:
- The survey was conducted on all families with six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assumption:
- The order of births is random, and all possible orders are equally likely.

Since there are 6 children in each family, and each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G), there are 2^6 = 64 possible orders of births.

The order G B G B B G is one of the possible orders, and we know that there are 45 families with this order.

To find the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can use the following reasoning:

1. The order B G B B B B is one of the possible orders, just like G B G B B G.
2. Since we assumed that all orders are equally likely, the number of families with the order B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G, which is 45.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is also 45.

{answer: 45}
