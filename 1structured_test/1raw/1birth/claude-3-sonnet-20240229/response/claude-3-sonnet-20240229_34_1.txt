To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families with six children and the probability of having the specific birth order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G.
- The total number of possible birth orders for six children is 2^6 = 64 (since each child can be either a boy or a girl).

Assuming that all birth orders are equally likely, the probability of having the specific birth order B G B B B B is 1/64.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B would be:

Estimated number of families = (1/64) × Total number of families surveyed

Since we know that there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed.

If 45 families have the order G B G B B G, and the probability of this order is also 1/64, then:

45 = (1/64) × Total number of families surveyed
Total number of families surveyed = 45 × 64 = 2,880

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B:

Estimated number of families with order B G B B B B = (1/64) × 2,880 = 45

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
