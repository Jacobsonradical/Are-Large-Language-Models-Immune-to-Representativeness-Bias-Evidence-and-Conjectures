To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the order G B G B B G.

Assumption: The births of boys and girls are independent and equally likely events.

Given:
- There are 45 families with the order G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is unknown.

We can calculate the probability of having the order G B G B B G and then use this probability to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

The probability of having the order G B G B B G is:
P(G B G B B G) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

This is because each birth is either a boy (B) or a girl (G), and the probability of each outcome is 1/2 (assuming equal likelihood).

Now, we can use the fact that there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G to estimate the total number of families surveyed.

Let N be the total number of families surveyed.

We know that:
45 = N × P(G B G B B G)
45 = N × (1/64)
N = 45 × 64 = 2,880

Assuming that the order B G B B B B is equally likely as G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by using the same probability:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Number of families with order B G B B B B = N × P(B G B B B B)
                                         = 2,880 × (1/64)
                                         = 45

Therefore, your estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
