To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to consider the possible permutations of the six children with three boys and three girls.

Given information:
- The exact order of births in 45 families was G B G B B G.
- We want to find the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B.

Since there are six children in each family, and the order of births is specified, we can calculate the number of possible permutations as follows:

Total number of permutations = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

The number of permutations with the exact order G B G B B G is 1 (since the order is fixed).

To find the number of permutations with the exact order B G B B B B, we need to consider the following:
- There are 3 boys and 3 girls.
- The first child is a boy, so there is 1 choice for the first position.
- The second child is a girl, so there are 3 choices for the second position.
- The third child is a boy, so there are 2 remaining choices for the third position.
- The remaining three positions can be filled in 3! = 6 ways.

Therefore, the number of permutations with the exact order B G B B B B is 1 × 3 × 2 × 6 = 36.

Since there are 720 possible permutations in total, and 36 of them correspond to the order B G B B B B, we can estimate the number of families with this order as:

Number of families with the order B G B B B B = (36 / 720) × 45 = 2.25
