To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to consider the possible permutations of this birth order and the probability of obtaining each permutation.

Given information:
- The total number of families surveyed had six children.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
- The birth order is equally likely for all families with six children.
- The birth of a boy or a girl is an independent event with a probability of 0.5 for each.

There are 6! = 720 possible permutations of six children's birth orders.

The specific order B G B B B B has only one permutation.

The probability of obtaining the order B G B B B B is:
P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and the probability of obtaining any specific order is the same, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

Number of families with order B G B B B B = (45 / P(G B G B B G)) × P(B G B B B B)
Number of families with order B G B B B B = (45 / (1/64)) × (1/64)
Number of families with order B G B B B B = 45

{answer: 45}
