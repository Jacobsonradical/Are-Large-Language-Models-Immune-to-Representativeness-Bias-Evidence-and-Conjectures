To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the possible permutations of the six children, where there are three boys and three girls.

The total number of permutations of six children, with three boys and three girls, is:
6! / (3! × 3!) = 720 / (6 × 6) = 20

Out of these 20 permutations, only one permutation corresponds to the order B G B B B B.

Assuming that all permutations are equally likely, the proportion of families with the order B G B B B B would be 1/20.

Since we know that there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by using the same proportion.

{answer: 45 / 20 = 2.25}

Therefore, your estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is approximately 2.
