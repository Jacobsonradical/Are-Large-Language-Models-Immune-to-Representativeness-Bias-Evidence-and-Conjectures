To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this birth order occurring and the total number of families surveyed.

Given information:
- The survey was conducted on all families with six children in the city.
- 45 families had the exact order of births G B G B B G.

Assuming that the gender of each child is an independent event with an equal probability of being a boy or a girl (0.5 for each), the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 1/64

Since 45 families had the order G B G B B G, and there are only two possible orders of six children with three boys and three girls, we can assume that the other 45 families had the order B G B B B B.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
