To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families with six children and then determine the proportion of families with the order GBGBBG to estimate the number of families with the order BGBBBB.

Given information:
- There are families with six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was GBGBBG.

Step 1: Find the total number of possible orders for six children.
The total number of possible orders = 2^6 = 64 (since each child can be either a boy or a girl).

Step 2: Find the proportion of families with the order GBGBBG.
Proportion of families with the order GBGBBG = 45 / Total number of families with six children

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the order BGBBBB.
Since the order BGBBBB is the reverse of GBGBBG, we can assume that the proportion of families with the order BGBBBB is the same as the proportion of families with the order GBGBBG.

Proportion of families with the order BGBBBB = 45 / Total number of families with six children

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order BGBBBB = 45.

{answer: 45}
