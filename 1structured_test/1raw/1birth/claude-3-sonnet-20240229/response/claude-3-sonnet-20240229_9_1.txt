To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, I need to make some assumptions based on the given information.

Assumptions:
1. The order of births of boys and girls in each family is random and independent of other families.
2. The probability of having a boy or a girl in any given birth is equal (0.5 for each).
3. The survey covered all families with exactly six children in the city.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the order of births was G B G B B G.

The probability of having the order G B G B B G is (0.5)^6 = 1/64, since each birth has an equal probability of 0.5 for a boy or a girl.

The probability of having the order B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6 = 1/64, as it is the opposite of G B G B B G.

If we assume that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is proportional to the number of families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as:

Number of families with B G B B B B = (45 * 1/64) / (1/64) = 45

Therefore, my estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
