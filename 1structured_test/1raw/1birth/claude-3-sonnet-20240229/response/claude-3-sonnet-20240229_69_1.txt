To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of possible orderings of six children and the probability of obtaining the specific ordering B G B B B B.

Given:
- There are 6 children in each family.
- The total number of possible orderings of 6 children is 6! = 720.
- The specific ordering we want to find is B G B B B B.

We can calculate the probability of obtaining the specific ordering B G B B B B as follows:
- There are 6 positions to arrange the children.
- The first position can be filled by either a boy (B) or a girl (G), so there are 2 possibilities.
- The second position can be filled by the remaining gender, so there is 1 possibility.
- The third position can be filled by either a boy (B) or a girl (G), so there are 2 possibilities.
- The remaining 3 positions must be filled by boys (B), so there is 1 possibility.
- The total number of possibilities for the specific ordering B G B B B B is 2 × 1 × 2 × 1 = 4.

The probability of obtaining the specific ordering B G B B B B is 4 / 720 = 1 / 180.

If we assume that the families are equally likely to have any of the possible orderings, then the number of families with the specific ordering B G B B B B should be proportional to the probability 1 / 180.

Since we know that there are 45 families with the ordering G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the number of families with the ordering B G B B B B.

Let x be the number of families with the ordering B G B B B B.
Then, x / 45 = (1 / 180) / (6 / 720) = 1 / 30

Solving for x, we get:
x = 45 / 30 = 1.5

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the ordering B G B B B B is:
