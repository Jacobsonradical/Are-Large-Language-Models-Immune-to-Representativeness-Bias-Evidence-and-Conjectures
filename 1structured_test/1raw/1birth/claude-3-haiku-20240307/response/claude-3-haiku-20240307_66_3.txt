To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families surveyed and then calculate the proportion of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assuming the birth order of children in each family is equally likely, the proportion of families with the birth order B G B B B B can be estimated as follows:

Let the total number of families surveyed be N.

The proportion of families with the birth order B G B B B B = (Number of families with B G B B B B) / N

Since the total number of families surveyed is not given, we can't determine the exact number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Therefore, the answer will be:
