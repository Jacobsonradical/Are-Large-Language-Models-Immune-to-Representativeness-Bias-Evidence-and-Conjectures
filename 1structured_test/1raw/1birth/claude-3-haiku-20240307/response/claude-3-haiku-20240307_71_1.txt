To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of a specific birth order occurring.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each), and the births are independent events, the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

If we assume that the total number of families surveyed is N, then the expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:

Number of families with B G B B B B = N × 0.015625

However, the question does not provide the total number of families surveyed (N). Therefore, the best we can do is to provide an estimate based on the given information.

{answer: (45 / 0.015625) ≈ 2,880}

This estimate suggests that the total number of families surveyed is approximately 2,880, and the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is around 45.
