To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific birth order occurring.

Given that the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we can only provide an estimate based on the information given.

Assuming that the births of boys and girls are equally likely, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

If we assume that the 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G represent a significant portion of the total families surveyed, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

{answer: 45 / 64 â‰ˆ 0.70}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G represent a significant portion of the total families surveyed, and that the births of boys and girls are equally likely.
