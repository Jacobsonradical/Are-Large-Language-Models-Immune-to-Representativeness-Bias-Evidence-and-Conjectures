To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of a family having the exact birth order of B G B B B B, given that the survey was conducted on all families of six children in the city.

The total number of possible birth orders for six children (3 boys and 3 girls) is 6! = 720.

The number of families with the birth order of G B G B B G is 45.

The number of families with the birth order of B G B B B B is unknown, which we need to estimate.

Let's assume that the birth order of the children is equally likely for all families. Then, the probability of a family having the birth order of B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = 1/720

To estimate the number of families with the birth order of B G B B B B, we can multiply this probability by the total number of families surveyed.

Since the survey was conducted on all families of six children in the city, the total number of families surveyed is unknown. However, we can use the information about the 45 families with the birth order of G B G B B G to estimate the total number of families.

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is N. Then, the number of families with the birth order of G B G B B G is 45, and the probability of this birth order is 1/720.

Therefore, we can write the equation:

45 = N * (1/720)

Solving for N, we get:

N = 45 * 720 = 32,400

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order of B G B B B B as:

{answer: 32,400 * (1/720) = 45}
