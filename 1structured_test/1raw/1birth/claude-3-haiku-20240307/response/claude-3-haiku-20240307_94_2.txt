To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B, given the information provided.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the principle of proportionality.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each), the probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since the probability of having the exact order of births as G B G B B G is also 1/64, we can use the following proportion:

45 / (total number of families) = 1 / 64
total number of families = 45 * 64

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45 * 64 = 2,880}
