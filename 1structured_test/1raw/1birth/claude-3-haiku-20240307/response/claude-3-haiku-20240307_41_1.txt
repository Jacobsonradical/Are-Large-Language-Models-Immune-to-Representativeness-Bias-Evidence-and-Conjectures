To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of this specific birth order.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

Since the total number of families surveyed is not given, we cannot directly calculate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. However, we can make an estimate based on the information provided.

Assuming the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is 1/64, as there are 6 possible choices for each birth.

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B can be calculated as:

{answer: 45 / 64}
