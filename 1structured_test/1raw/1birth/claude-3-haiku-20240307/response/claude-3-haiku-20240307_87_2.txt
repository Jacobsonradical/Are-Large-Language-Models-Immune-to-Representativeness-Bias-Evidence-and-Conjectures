To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the given birth order pattern (B G B B B B) and then multiply it by the total number of families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Assumptions:
- The probability of having a boy or a girl in each birth is 0.5 (i.e., equal probability).
- The births are independent events.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of the birth order pattern B G B B B B.
Probability of the first child being a boy = 0.5
Probability of the second child being a girl = 0.5
Probability of the third child being a boy = 0.5
Probability of the fourth child being a boy = 0.5
Probability of the fifth child being a boy = 0.5
Probability of the sixth child being a boy = 0.5

Probability of the birth order pattern B G B B B B = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.015625

Step 2: Estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B.
Total number of families surveyed = 45 / 0.015625 = 2,880

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 2,880}
