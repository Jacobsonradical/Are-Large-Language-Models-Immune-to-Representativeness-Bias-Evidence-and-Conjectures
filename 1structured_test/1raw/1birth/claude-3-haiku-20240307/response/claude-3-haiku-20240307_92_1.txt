To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B, given that the survey was conducted on families with six children.

The total number of possible birth orders for a family with six children is 6! = 720.

The number of families with the exact order of births G B G B B G is given as 45.

The probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B is the number of such families divided by the total number of families surveyed.

Since the total number of families surveyed is not given, we can only provide an estimate based on the information provided.

Assuming that the distribution of birth orders is uniform, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 45 * (1/720)}
