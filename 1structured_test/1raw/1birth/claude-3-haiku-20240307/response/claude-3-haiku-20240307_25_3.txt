To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact birth order of B G B B B B among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact birth order was G B G B B G.
- We need to find the estimate of the number of families with the exact birth order of B G B B B B.

Assuming that the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely, the probability of the exact birth order of B G B B B B is:

Probability of B G B B B B = 1 / 2^6 = 1 / 64

Now, to estimate the number of families with the exact birth order of B G B B B B, we can multiply the probability by the total number of families surveyed.

The total number of families surveyed is not given, but we can estimate it based on the information provided.

Since there are 45 families with the birth order of G B G B B G, and this is one of the 64 possible birth orders, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as:

Total number of families surveyed = 45 × 64 = 2,880

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the exact birth order of B G B B B B is:

{answer: 2,880 × (1 / 64) = 45}
