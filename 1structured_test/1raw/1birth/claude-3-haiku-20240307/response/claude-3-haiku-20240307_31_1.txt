To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information provided about the other birth order.

Given that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G, we can assume that the remaining families had a different birth order.

Since the total number of families is not provided, we cannot determine the exact number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. However, we can provide an estimate based on the information given.

{answer: unknown}

Without additional information about the total number of families surveyed, it is not possible to provide a precise estimate for the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. The best we can say is that the answer is unknown.
