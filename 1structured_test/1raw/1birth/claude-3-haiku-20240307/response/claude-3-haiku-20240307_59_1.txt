To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the birth order "B G B B B B" among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- 45 families had the birth order "G B G B B G".
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

We can estimate the number of families with the birth order "B G B B B B" by assuming that the probability of each birth order is equally likely.

The probability of the birth order "B G B B B B" is 1 in 64, as there are 6 children and each can be either a boy or a girl, resulting in 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders.

Since 45 families had the birth order "G B G B B G", the remaining 19 birth orders must make up the total number of families surveyed.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order "B G B B B B" is:

{answer: 19 / 64 = approximately 0.297 or 0.3}
