To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information given about the 45 families where the order was G B G B B G.

Given information:
- 45 families were surveyed where the order of births was G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families where the order of births was B G B B B B.

Assuming the births are equally likely to be boys or girls, we can use the binomial distribution to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, which is 0.5.

The probability of having the order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

If we assume that the total number of families surveyed is N, then the expected number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

{answer: N * 0.015625}
