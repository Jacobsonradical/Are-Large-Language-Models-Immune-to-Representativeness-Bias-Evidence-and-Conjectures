To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the births of boys and girls are equally likely, the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = 1/64

This is because there are 6 possible positions for the boys and 6 possible positions for the girls, and the total number of possible orders is 2^6 = 64.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45 * (1/64) = 0.703125 families}

Note: Since the number of families cannot be a fractional value, the answer is rounded down to the nearest whole number, which is 0 families.
