To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions.

Let's assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., the probability of having a boy is 0.5 and the probability of having a girl is 0.5). Under this assumption, the probability of having the exact order of births B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Now, we can use this probability to estimate the number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B, given that 45 families had the order G B G B B G.

{answer: 45 / 0.015625 = 2,880}
