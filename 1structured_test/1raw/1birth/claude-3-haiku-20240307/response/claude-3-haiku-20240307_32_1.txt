To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B among the surveyed families.

Given information:
- 45 families have the exact order of births as G B G B B G.

The probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B is the number of families with that order divided by the total number of families surveyed.

Since the total number of families surveyed is not given, we cannot provide an exact answer. However, we can provide an estimate based on the information provided.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5), the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

This means that the estimated number of families with the exact order of births being B G B B B B is:

{answer: 0.015625 Ã— (total number of families surveyed)}
