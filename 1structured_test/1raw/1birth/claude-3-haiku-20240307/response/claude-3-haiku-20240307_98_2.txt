To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific arrangement of boys and girls.

Given that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can assume that the remaining families had other possible arrangements of boys and girls.

The probability of the order B G B B B B is 1/64, as there are 6 children and the probability of each child being a boy or a girl is 1/2.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45 / 64}
