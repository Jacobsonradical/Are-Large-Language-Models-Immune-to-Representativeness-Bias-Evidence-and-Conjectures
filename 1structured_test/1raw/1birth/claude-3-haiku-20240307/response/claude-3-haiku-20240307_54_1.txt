To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the assumption of equal probability for all possible birth orders.

The probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B is 1 out of 6! = 1/720.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45 / 720}
