To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this sequence occurring.

Given that the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we can only estimate the number of families with the specified birth order.

Assuming that the births of boys and girls are independent and equally likely, the probability of the sequence B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed with this birth order is:

{answer: 45 * (1/64)}
