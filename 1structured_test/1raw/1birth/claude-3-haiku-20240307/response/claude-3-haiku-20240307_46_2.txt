To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of the given birth order pattern.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- We need to estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Assuming that the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of the given birth order patterns.

The probability of the birth order G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.
The probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Since the probability of both birth order patterns is the same, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is likely to be the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
