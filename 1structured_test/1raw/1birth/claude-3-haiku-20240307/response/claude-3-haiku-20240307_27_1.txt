To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific birth order occurring.

Given:
- The survey covered all families of six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the probability of a boy or a girl being born is equal (0.5 each), the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

This means that the probability of this specific birth order is approximately 1.5625%.

To estimate the number of families with this birth order, we need to apply this probability to the total number of families surveyed.

Let's assume the total number of families surveyed is N.

The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B = N × 0.015625

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{answer: N × 0.015625}
