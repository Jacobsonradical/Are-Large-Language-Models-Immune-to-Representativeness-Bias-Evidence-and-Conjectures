To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of the exact birth order B G B B B B among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- 45 families were surveyed, and the exact order of births of boys (B) and girls (G) was G B G B B G.
- We need to estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Assuming that the births of boys and girls are equally likely, the probability of the exact order B G B B B B can be calculated as follows:

Probability of B G B B B B = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Now, to estimate the number of families with this exact birth order, we can multiply the probability by the total number of families surveyed:

{answer: 45 * (1/64) = approximately 0.703 families}

Note that the answer is rounded to the nearest whole number, as the question asks for an estimate.
