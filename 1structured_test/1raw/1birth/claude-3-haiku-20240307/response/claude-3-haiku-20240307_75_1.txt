To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of this specific birth order occurring.

Given information:
- 45 families had the birth order of G B G B B G.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equally likely (0.5 for each), the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Since the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we can't determine the exact number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. However, we can estimate the number based on the probability.

If we assume that the total number of families surveyed is 100 (this is an arbitrary assumption, as the question does not provide the total number), then the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 1.5625}

This is calculated as 100 Ã— 0.015625 = 1.5625, which is the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
