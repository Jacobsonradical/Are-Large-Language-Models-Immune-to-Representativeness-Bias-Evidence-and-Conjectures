To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B, given that the total number of families surveyed is unknown.

The probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B is the number of families with this order divided by the total number of families surveyed.

Since the question states that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is greater than 45.

Without additional information, it is difficult to provide a precise estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births being B G B B B B. However, we can provide a lower bound estimate based on the given information.

The probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B is likely to be much lower than the probability of the order being G B G B B G, as the latter order is more common.

Therefore, a reasonable lower bound estimate for the number of families with the exact order of births being B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 1}

This is a conservative estimate, as the actual number could be higher, but without more information, we cannot provide a more precise estimate.
