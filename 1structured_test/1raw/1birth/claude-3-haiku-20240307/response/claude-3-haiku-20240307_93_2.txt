To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the given information about the 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

Assuming that the distribution of birth orders is uniform across all families, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B based on the proportion of the total number of families.

Given information:
- 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is unknown.

Let's assume the total number of families surveyed is N.

The proportion of families with the birth order G B G B B G is 45/N.

Since the distribution of birth orders is assumed to be uniform, the proportion of families with the birth order B G B B B B should be the same as the proportion of families with the order G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
