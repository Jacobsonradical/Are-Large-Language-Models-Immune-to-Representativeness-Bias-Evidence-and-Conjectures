To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the order of births as G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

Assumption:
- We assume that the total number of families surveyed is large enough for the proportions of different birth orders to be representative.

To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probability.

The probability of a specific birth order in a family of six children is 1/2^6 = 1/64.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 45 / 64}
