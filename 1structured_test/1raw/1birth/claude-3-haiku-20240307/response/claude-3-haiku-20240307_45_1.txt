To solve this problem, we need to make some assumptions about the distribution of the birth order patterns among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Without any additional information, we can assume that the birth order patterns are equally likely among the families. Therefore, our estimate of the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B would be proportional to the number of ways to arrange 6 children into this pattern.

The number of ways to arrange 6 children into the pattern B G B B B B is 6! / (1! * 5!) = 6.

Assuming the birth order patterns are equally likely, the estimate of the number of families surveyed where the exact order of births was B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 6}
