To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the birth order "B G B B B B" occurring among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- The survey included all families of six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

We can assume that the birth order of each child is equally likely, and the births are independent events.

The probability of the birth order "B G B B B B" can be calculated as follows:
P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since the survey included all families of six children in the city, the total number of families surveyed is unknown. However, we can estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B based on the given information.

The number of families with the birth order "B G B B B B" can be estimated as:
{answer: 45 / 64}

This estimate is based on the assumption that the birth order "B G B B B B" is equally likely to occur as the birth order "G B G B B G" among the families surveyed.
