To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of observing the exact birth order B G B B B B among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- The survey included all families of six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each), the probability of observing the exact birth order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Since the survey included all families of six children in the city, we can estimate the number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B as:

{answer: 0.015625 Ã— total number of families}
