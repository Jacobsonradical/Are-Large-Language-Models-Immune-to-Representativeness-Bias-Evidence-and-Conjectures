To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B, given that the total number of families surveyed is unknown.

Given information:
- 45 families had the exact order of births as G B G B B G.

We can use the principle of complementary events to find the estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Since the total number of families surveyed is unknown, let's assume the total number of families is N.

The probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B is the complement of the probability of the exact order of births being G B G B B G.

P(B G B B B B) = 1 - P(G B G B B G)
P(B G B B B B) = 1 - (45/N)

To get the estimate of the number of families, we need to multiply the probability by the total number of families (N):

Estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B = N * (1 - 45/N)

Therefore, the answer is:

{answer: N * (1 - 45/N)}
