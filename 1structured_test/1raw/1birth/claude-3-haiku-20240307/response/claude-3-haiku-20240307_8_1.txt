To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each), the probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Since the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we cannot directly calculate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B.

However, we can estimate the number of families with this order by assuming that the total number of families surveyed is proportional to the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

Let's assume the total number of families surveyed is N.

The number of families with the order G B G B B G is 45, so the number of families with the order B G B B B B can be estimated as:

{answer: 45 Ã— 0.015625 = 0.703125}

This is an estimate, as the actual number of families with the order B G B B B B may be slightly different.
