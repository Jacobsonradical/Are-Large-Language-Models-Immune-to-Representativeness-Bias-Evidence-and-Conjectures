To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of such an order occurring.

Given information:
- 45 families had the exact order of births as G B G B B G.

The probability of the order B G B B B B occurring can be calculated as follows:
Probability of the first child being a boy = 1/2
Probability of the second child being a girl = 1/2
Probability of the next four children being boys = (1/2)^4 = 1/16

Total probability of the order B G B B B B = 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/16 = 1/64

If we assume that the total number of families surveyed is N, then the expected number of families with the order B G B B B B would be:
Expected number of families = N × (1/64)

Since the question asks for an estimate, we can round this value to the nearest integer.

{answer: N/64}
