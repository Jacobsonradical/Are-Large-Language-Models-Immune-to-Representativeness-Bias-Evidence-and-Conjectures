To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of the given birth order patterns.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact birth order of G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families with the exact birth order of B G B B B B.

Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

The probability of the birth order G B G B B G is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Since there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as:

{answer: 45}

The reasoning is that if the probabilities of the two birth orders are equal, and there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, then the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.
