To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific order of births occurring.

Given that:
- There are 6 children in each family
- The exact order of births in 45 families was G B G B B G

We can calculate the probability of the order B G B B B B occurring as follows:

The probability of having 6 boys in a family of 6 children is (6 choose 6) / 2^6 = 1/64.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45 * (1/64) â‰ˆ 0.7}
