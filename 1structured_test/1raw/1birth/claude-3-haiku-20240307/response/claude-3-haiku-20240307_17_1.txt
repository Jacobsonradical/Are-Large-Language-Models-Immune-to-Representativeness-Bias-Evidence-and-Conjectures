To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is N.

The probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B is given by the combination of 6 children, where 5 are boys and 1 is a girl.

The probability of this event is:
(5 choose 1) / (6 choose 6) = 5/6

The expected number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:
N Ã— (5/6)

Since we don't know the total number of families surveyed (N), we can't provide a precise estimate. However, we can provide a range of possible estimates based on the given information.

{answer: 37.5 to 45}

This range is based on the assumption that the total number of families surveyed (N) is between 45 (the number of families with the order G B G B B G) and 45 / (5/6) = 54 (the maximum possible number of families surveyed).
