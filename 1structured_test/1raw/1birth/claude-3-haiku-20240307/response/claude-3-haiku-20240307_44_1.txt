To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B, given the information about the 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

The total number of families surveyed is not provided, but we can use the information about the 45 families with the order G B G B B G to estimate the total number of families.

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is N. Since the order G B G B B G was observed in 45 families, the probability of this order is 45/N.

The probability of the order B G B B B B can be calculated using the binomial distribution. The probability of a boy being born is 0.5, and the probability of a girl being born is also 0.5. The probability of the order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B can be calculated as:

{answer: 0.015625 * N}
