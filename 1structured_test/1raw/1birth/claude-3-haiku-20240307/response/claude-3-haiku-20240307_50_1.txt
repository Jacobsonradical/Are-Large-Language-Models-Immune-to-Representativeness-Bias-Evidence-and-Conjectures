To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B, given that the survey was conducted on all families of six children in the city.

The total number of possible birth orders for six children (3 boys and 3 girls) is 6! = 720.

The number of families where the exact order of births was G B G B B G is given as 45.

The number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B can be estimated using the principle of symmetry. Since the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely, the probability of each birth order is the same.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
