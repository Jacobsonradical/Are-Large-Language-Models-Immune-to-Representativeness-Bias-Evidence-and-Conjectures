To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the given information and some probabilistic reasoning.

Given:
- The exact order of births in 45 families was G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B.

Assuming that the gender of each child is independent and the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., 50% each), we can calculate the probability of the two different birth orders:

P(G B G B B G) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64
P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since the probabilities are equal, we can assume that the number of families with the two different birth orders is also proportional to their probabilities.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
