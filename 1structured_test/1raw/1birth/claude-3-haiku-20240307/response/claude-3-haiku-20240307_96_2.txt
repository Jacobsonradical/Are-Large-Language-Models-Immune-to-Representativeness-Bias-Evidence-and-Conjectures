To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B, given the information provided.

The information given states that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G. This means that the total number of families surveyed is at least 45.

Since the question asks for an estimate, we can make the following assumption:
* The probability of a family having the order B G B B B B is the same as the probability of having the order G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
