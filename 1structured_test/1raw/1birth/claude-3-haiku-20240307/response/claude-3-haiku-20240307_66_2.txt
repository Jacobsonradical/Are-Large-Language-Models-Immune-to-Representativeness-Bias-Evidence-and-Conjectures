To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B, given that the total number of families surveyed is unknown.

The total number of families surveyed is not given, but we know that in 45 of those families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is N. Since the probability of the exact order of births being G B G B B G is 45/N, we can use this information to estimate the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B.

The probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B is 1/64, as there are 6 children and each child can be either a boy or a girl, and the order of births is fixed.

We can set up a proportion to find the estimate:
(45/N) / (1/64) = (unknown number of families with B G B B B B) / N

Solving for the unknown number of families with B G B B B B, we get:
(unknown number of families with B G B B B B) = (45/N) * N * (1/64) = 45/64

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45/64}
