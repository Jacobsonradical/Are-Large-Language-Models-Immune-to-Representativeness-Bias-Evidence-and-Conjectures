To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B in the given population of families.

Given information:
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each), we can calculate the probability of the order B G B B B B.

The probability of this order is:
P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Since the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we cannot directly calculate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

However, we can estimate the number of families with this order based on the given information.

{answer: 45 × 0.015625 ≈ 0.703}

The estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is approximately 0.703 families.
