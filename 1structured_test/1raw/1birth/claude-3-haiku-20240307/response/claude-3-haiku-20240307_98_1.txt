To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B, given the information about the 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

The total number of families surveyed is not provided in the problem statement. However, we can make an estimate based on the given information.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each), the probability of having the order G B G B B G is:

P(G B G B B G) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Since there are 45 families with this order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as:

Total families surveyed = 45 / 0.015625 = 2,880 families

Now, the probability of having the order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 2,880 Ã— 0.015625 = 45}
