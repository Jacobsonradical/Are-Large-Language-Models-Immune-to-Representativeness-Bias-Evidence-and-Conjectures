To solve this problem, we need to estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the concept of permutations.

The total number of possible birth orders for a family of six children is 6! = 720.

The number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is 45.

Therefore, the remaining number of families is 720 - 45 = 675.

Assuming that the birth orders are equally likely, the estimate of the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
