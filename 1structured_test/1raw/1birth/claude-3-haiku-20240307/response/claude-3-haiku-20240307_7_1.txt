To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of observing the exact birth order of B G B B B B among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- The survey was conducted on all families of six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births of boys (B) and girls (G) was G B G B B G.

Since the question is asking for the estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to calculate the probability of this event and then multiply it by the total number of families surveyed.

The probability of observing the birth order B G B B B B can be calculated using the formula for the probability of a specific sequence of events:

Probability = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to multiply the probability by the total number of families surveyed.

Unfortunately, the total number of families surveyed is not provided in the question. However, we can use the information about the 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G to estimate the total number of families.

Let's assume that the 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G represent a fraction of the total number of families. We can then use this fraction to estimate the total number of families surveyed.

{answer: (1/64) * (45 / (45/6)) = 45}

The estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.
