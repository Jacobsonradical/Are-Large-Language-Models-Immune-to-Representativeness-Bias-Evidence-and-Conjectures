To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact birth order of B G B B B B, given the information provided.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births of boys (B) and girls (G) was G B G B B G.

To find the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to calculate the probability of this event and then multiply it by the total number of families surveyed.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is 0.5 (equal probability), the probability of having the exact birth order of B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 0.015625 Ã— (total number of families surveyed)}

Note: The total number of families surveyed is not provided in the problem statement, so the answer cannot be a precise number. The answer is an estimate based on the given information.
