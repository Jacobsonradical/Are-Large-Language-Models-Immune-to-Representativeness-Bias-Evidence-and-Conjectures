To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the fact that the probability of each order of births is equally likely.

The probability of the order B G B B B B is 1/6, as there are 6 possible orders for the 6 children, and one of them is B G B B B B.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45 Ã— (1/6) = 7.5}

Note that the final answer is rounded to the nearest whole number, as the question is asking for an estimate.
