To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B.

Given information:
- The survey was conducted on all families of six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probability.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each), the probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Since the survey was conducted on all families of six children in the city, we can estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B by multiplying the probability by the total number of families surveyed.

Unfortunately, the total number of families surveyed is not provided in the given information. However, we can make an estimate based on the information given.

If 45 families had the exact order of births as G B G B B G, and the probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B is 0.015625, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as:

{answer: 45 / 0.015625 = 2,880}
