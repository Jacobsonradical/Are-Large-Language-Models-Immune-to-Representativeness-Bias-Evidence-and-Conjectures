To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B, given the information provided.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

The probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B can be calculated as follows:

Let the total number of families surveyed be N.

The probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B is:
P(B G B B B B) = (Families with B G B B B B) / (Total families surveyed)

Since the question asks for an estimate, we can assume that the 45 families with the order G B G B B G represent a proportional sample of the total families surveyed.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the exact order of births being B G B B B B can be calculated as:

{answer: (45 / 6) = 7.5}

Note: Since the question asks for an integer estimate, the final answer is rounded down to 7.
