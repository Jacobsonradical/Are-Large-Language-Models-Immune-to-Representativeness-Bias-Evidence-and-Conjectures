To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact birth order of B G B B B B, given the information provided.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact birth order is G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

Assuming that the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely, the probability of a family having the exact birth order of B G B B B B is 1/64, as there are 6 children and the order of 3 boys and 3 girls can be arranged in 64 (2^6) different ways.

To estimate the number of families with the birth order of B G B B B B, we can use the proportion of families with the G B G B B G birth order to the total number of families surveyed.

Let's denote the total number of families surveyed as N.

The proportion of families with the G B G B B G birth order is:
45 / N

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the B G B B B B birth order is:
{answer: (1/64) * N * (45 / N) = 45/64}
