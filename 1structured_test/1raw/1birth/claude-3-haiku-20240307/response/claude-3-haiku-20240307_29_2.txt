To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of this particular birth order occurring.

Given information:
- 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

Assuming that the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is 1/64 (since there are 6 children, and the probability of each child being a boy or a girl is 1/2).

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B can be calculated as:

{answer: (45 / 6) Ã— (1/64)}
