To solve this problem, we need to estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probability and the fact that the total number of possible birth orders is 6! = 720.

The probability of getting the order B G B B B B is 1/720, as there is only one way to get this specific order.

Since there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, the remaining number of families surveyed is 720 - 45 = 675.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B is:
{answer: 675 * (1/720)}
