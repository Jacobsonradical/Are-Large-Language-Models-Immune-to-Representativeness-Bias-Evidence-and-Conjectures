To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of this specific birth order.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

Assuming the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is 1/64, as there are 6 children and each can be either a boy or a girl, resulting in 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders.

Since the question asks for an estimate, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is at least 45 + (45 Ã— 64) = 2,925 families. This is based on the assumption that the families with the birth order G B G B B G represent at least 1/64 of the total families surveyed.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45.71}
