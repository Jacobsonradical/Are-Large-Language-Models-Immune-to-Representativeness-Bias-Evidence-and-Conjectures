To solve this problem, we need to estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can use the principle of symmetry. Since the order of births (B and G) is equally likely, the number of families with the order B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
