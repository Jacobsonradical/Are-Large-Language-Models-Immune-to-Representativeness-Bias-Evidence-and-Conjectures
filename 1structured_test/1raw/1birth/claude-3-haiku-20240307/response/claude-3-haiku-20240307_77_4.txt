To solve this problem, we need to estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Since the problem asks for an estimate, we can assume that the distribution of birth orders is uniform across all families surveyed.

Therefore, the estimated number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 45}
