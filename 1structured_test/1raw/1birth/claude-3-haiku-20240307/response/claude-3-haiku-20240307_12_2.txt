To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of this specific birth order.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assumption:
- We assume that the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely in all families.

Probability of the birth order B G B B B B:
- The probability of this birth order is 1 in 6^6 = 1 in 46,656.

Estimate of the number of families:
- If the total number of families surveyed is N, then the expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is N / 46,656.

Therefore, the answer is:

{answer: N / 46,656}

Where N is the total number of families surveyed. Without knowing the total number of families surveyed, we cannot provide a specific estimate.
