To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the following:

1. The total number of families surveyed is not given.
2. The question states that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
3. We are asked to estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Given the information provided, we cannot determine the exact number of families with the order B G B B B B. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the assumption that the different birth orders are equally likely.

If the total number of families surveyed is N, then the number of families with the order G B G B B G would be 45. Assuming that the different birth orders are equally likely, the number of families with the order B G B B B B would be 45/6 = 7.5.

Since we cannot have a fractional number of families, we can round this estimate to the nearest integer, which would be 8.
