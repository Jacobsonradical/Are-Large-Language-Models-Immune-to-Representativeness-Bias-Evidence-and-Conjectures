To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the birth order B G B B B B, given the information about the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Let's assume the total number of families surveyed is N.

Given information:
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- We need to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

The probability of a family having the birth order B G B B B B is 1/64, as there are 6 children and the order of boys and girls is fixed.

The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B can be estimated as:

{answer: N * (1/64)}

Note: The actual number of families with the birth order B G B B B B will depend on the total number of families surveyed (N), which is not provided in the problem statement.
