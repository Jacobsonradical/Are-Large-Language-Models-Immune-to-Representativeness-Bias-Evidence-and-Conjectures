To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific sequence of births.

The probability of a family having a specific order of births can be calculated using the binomial distribution. In this case, we have 6 children, and the probability of having a boy or a girl is 0.5 each (assuming an equal probability of having a boy or a girl).

The probability of the sequence B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Assuming that the 45 families with the order G B G B B G are a representative sample of the total number of families surveyed, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

{answer: 45 * 0.015625 = 0.703125, which we can round to 1}
