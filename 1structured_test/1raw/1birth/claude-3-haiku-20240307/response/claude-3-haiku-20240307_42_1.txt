To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information provided about the 45 families where the order was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the distribution of birth orders is approximately uniform across all families, we can use the proportion of families with the G B G B B G order to estimate the proportion of families with the B G B B B B order.

The total number of possible birth orders for a family of six children is 6! = 720. The number of families with the G B G B B G order is 45, so the proportion of families with this order is 45/720 = 1/16.

Assuming the same proportion for the B G B B B B order, the estimated number of families with this order would be:

{answer: 45}
