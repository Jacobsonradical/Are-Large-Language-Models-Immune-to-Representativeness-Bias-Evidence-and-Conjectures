To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the principle of complementarity.

Since the total number of families is not given, we can assume that the probability of any particular order of births is equal.

The probability of the order G B G B B G is 45 out of the total number of families.

The probability of the order B G B B B B is the complement of the probability of the order G B G B B G, which is (1 - 45/total) = (total - 45)/total.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:

{answer: (total - 45)}
