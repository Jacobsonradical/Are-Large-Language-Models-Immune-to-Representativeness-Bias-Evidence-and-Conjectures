To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the following:

1. The total number of families surveyed is not given, but we know that 45 families had the order G B G B B G.
2. The question is asking for an estimate, which means we need to make an assumption about the probability of the order B G B B B B occurring.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5), the probability of the order B G B B B B can be calculated as follows:

Probability of B G B B B B = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.015625

If we assume that the families are independent and the probabilities are the same, then the expected number of families with the order B G B B B B can be estimated as:

{answer: 45 × 0.015625 = 0.703125 (rounded to 0.7)}

This is an estimate, as the actual number of families with the order B G B B B B may differ from the calculated value.
