To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of this specific birth order.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50% chance for each), the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Since the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we cannot determine the exact number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. However, we can provide an estimate based on the given information.

Let's assume the total number of families surveyed is N. Then, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is estimated to be:

{answer: N/64}

This is because the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is 1/64, and the total number of families surveyed is N.
