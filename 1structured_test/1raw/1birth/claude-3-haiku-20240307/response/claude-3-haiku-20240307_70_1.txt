To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B, given that 45 families had the order G B G B B G.

The total number of families surveyed is not given, but we can use the information provided to estimate it.

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is N.

The probability of a family having the order G B G B B G is 45/N.

The probability of a family having the order B G B B B B is unknown, but we can estimate it using the principle of equally likely outcomes.

Since there are 6 children in each family, and the order of births is important, there are 6! = 720 possible orders of births.

The order G B G B B G is one of the 720 possible orders, and the order B G B B B B is also one of the 720 possible orders.

Therefore, the probability of a family having the order B G B B B B is 1/720.

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as:

{answer: (1/720) * N}
