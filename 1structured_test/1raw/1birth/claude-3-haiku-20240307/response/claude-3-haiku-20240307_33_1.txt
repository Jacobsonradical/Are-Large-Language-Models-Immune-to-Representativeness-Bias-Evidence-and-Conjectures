To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of the given birth order pattern, G B G B B G, and then use it to estimate the number of families with the birth order pattern B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the birth order pattern G B G B B G.

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is N.

The probability of the birth order pattern G B G B B G is:

P(G B G B B G) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since there are 45 families with this birth order pattern, the expected number of families with this pattern is:

45 = N × (1/64)

Solving for N, we get:

N = 45 × 64 = 2,880 families surveyed

Now, to estimate the number of families with the birth order pattern B G B B B B, we need to calculate the probability of this pattern.

The probability of the birth order pattern B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order pattern B G B B B B is:

{answer: 2,880 × (1/64) = 45}
