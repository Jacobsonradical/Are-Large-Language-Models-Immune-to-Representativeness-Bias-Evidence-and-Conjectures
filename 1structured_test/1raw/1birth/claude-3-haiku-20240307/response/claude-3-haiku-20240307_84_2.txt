To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this particular birth order occurring.

Given that the survey included 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is likely much larger.

Without any additional information, we can make a reasonable estimate by assuming that the probability of each birth order (G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is equally likely.

Given that there are 6 children in each family, the total number of possible birth orders is 2^6 = 64.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 45 / 64 * total number of families surveyed}

This estimate assumes that the birth orders are equally likely and that the 45 families with the order G B G B B G represent a proportional sample of the total families surveyed.
