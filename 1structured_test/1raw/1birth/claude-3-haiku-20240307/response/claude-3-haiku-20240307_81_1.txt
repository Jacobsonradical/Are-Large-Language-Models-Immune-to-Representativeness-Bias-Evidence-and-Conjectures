To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the birth order B G B B B B and then multiply it by the total number of families surveyed.

Given information:
- The survey included all families of six children in the city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the probability of a family having the birth order B G B B B B.
   Probability of a family having the birth order B G B B B B = 1/64 (since there are 6 children and the probability of each gender is 1/2).

2. Multiply the probability by the total number of families surveyed.
   Total number of families surveyed = 45 (given)
   Estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B = 45 × (1/64) ≈ 0.703 families.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{answer: 0.703}
