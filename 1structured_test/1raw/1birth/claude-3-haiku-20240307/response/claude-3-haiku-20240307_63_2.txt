To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the overall distribution of families with six children.

Given information:
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Since the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we cannot directly calculate the number of families with the order B G B B B B. However, we can make an estimate based on the given information.

Assuming that the different birth orders are equally likely, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

{answer: 45}

The reasoning is that if 45 families had the order G B G B B G, and the different birth orders are equally likely, then we can estimate that 45 families would also have the order B G B B B B.

Please note that this is an estimate based on the assumption of equal likelihood of different birth orders. The actual number may vary depending on the true distribution of birth orders in the population.
