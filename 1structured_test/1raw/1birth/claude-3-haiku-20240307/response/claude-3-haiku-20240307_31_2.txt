To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the given information about the 45 families where the order was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the gender of each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, we can use the principles of combinatorics to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

The number of ways to arrange 6 children with the order B G B B B B is 6! = 720.

Given that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, the remaining families with other orders can be estimated as the total number of families minus the 45 families with the G B G B B G order.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 720 - 45 = 675}
