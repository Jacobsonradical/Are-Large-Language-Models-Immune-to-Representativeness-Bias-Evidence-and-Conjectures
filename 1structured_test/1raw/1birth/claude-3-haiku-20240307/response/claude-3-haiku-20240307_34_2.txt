To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of families surveyed and then calculate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the total number of families surveyed is unknown, we can estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B using the following formula:

Let the total number of families surveyed be N.

The probability of getting the order B G B B B B in a family with 6 children is 1/64 (since there are 6 choose 3 = 20 ways to arrange 3 boys and 3 girls, and 1/20 of these arrangements is B G B B B B).

The expected number of families with the order B G B B B B is N * (1/64).

Since the actual number of families with the order G B G B B G is 45, we can set up the following equation:

45 = N * (1/64)

Solving for N, we get:

N = 45 * 64 = 2880

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 2880 * (1/64) = 45}
