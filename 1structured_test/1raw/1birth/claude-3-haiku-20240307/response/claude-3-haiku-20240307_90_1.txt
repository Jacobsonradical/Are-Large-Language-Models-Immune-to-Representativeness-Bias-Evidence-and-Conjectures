To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this order of births occurring.

Given that the exact order of births in 45 families was G B G B B G, we can assume that the overall distribution of boys and girls in the surveyed families is approximately equal.

Assuming a fair distribution of boys and girls, the probability of the order B G B B B B would be (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 45 * (1/64) = approximately 0.703 families}
