To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific order occurring.

Given information:
- There are 6 children in each family.
- 45 families have the order of births as G B G B B G.

The probability of the order B G B B B B is the same as the probability of the order G B G B B G, as the order of boys and girls can be reversed.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
