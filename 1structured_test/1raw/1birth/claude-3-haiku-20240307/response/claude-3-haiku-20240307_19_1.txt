To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific sequence occurring.

Given that 45 families had the exact order of births as G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is at least 45.

The probability of the sequence B G B B B B occurring can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of each individual birth event, assuming equal likelihood of having a boy or a girl.

The probability of the sequence B G B B B B is:
(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/64

Given that the total number of families surveyed is at least 45, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as:
{answer: 45 × (1/64) = 0.703125, which can be rounded to 1}
