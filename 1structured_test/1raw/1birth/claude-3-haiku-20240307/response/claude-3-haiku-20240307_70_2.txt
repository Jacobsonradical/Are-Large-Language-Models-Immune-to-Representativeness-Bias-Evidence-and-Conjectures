To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

The probability of having the order B G B B B B can be calculated as follows:

The total number of possible birth orders for 6 children is 6! = 720.

The number of families with the order B G B B B B is the number of ways to choose 6 boys out of 6 children, which is 1.

The probability of having the order B G B B B B is:
Probability = 1 / 720 = 0.001389 or approximately 0.14%

To estimate the number of families surveyed with the order B G B B B B, we need to multiply the probability by the total number of families surveyed.

Since the problem does not provide the total number of families surveyed, we cannot give an exact estimate. However, we can provide an estimate based on the information given.

{answer: Approximately 0.14% of the total number of families surveyed}
