To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B, given that 45 families had the order of G B G B B G.

The total number of families surveyed is not provided, but we can use the information about the 45 families with the order G B G B B G to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Assuming that the births of boys and girls are equally likely and independent, the probability of a family having the order B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

If we let the total number of families surveyed be N, then the number of families with the order B G B B B B can be estimated as:

(1/64) Ã— N = {answer: N/64}

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: N/64}
