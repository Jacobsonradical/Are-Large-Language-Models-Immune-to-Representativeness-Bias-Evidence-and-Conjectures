To solve this problem, we need to estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births of boys (B) and girls (G) as G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probability.

The probability of having a boy or a girl at each birth is approximately 0.5 (assuming a roughly equal ratio of male and female births).

The probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:
(0.5)^6 = 0.015625

Assuming that the total number of families surveyed is large, we can estimate the number of families with the exact order of B G B B B B as:
Number of families with B G B B B B = 45 × 0.015625 ≈ 0.703 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

Therefore, the answer is:

{answer: 0.703}
