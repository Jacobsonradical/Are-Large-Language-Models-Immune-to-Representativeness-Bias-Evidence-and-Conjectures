To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the given birth order pattern (B G B B B B) and then multiply it by the total number of families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the birth order pattern G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
- The birth of each child is independent and the probability of a boy or girl is equal (0.5 each).

Probability of the birth order pattern B G B B B B:
The probability of this pattern is the product of the probabilities of each child's gender, which is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Total number of families surveyed:
Since the problem states that all families of six children in the city were surveyed, we can assume that the total number of families is unknown.

Estimate of the number of families with the birth order pattern B G B B B B:
{answer: 0.015625 Ã— (total number of families surveyed)}

Note: The total number of families surveyed is not given, so the answer cannot be a specific number. The answer is an estimate based on the provided information.
