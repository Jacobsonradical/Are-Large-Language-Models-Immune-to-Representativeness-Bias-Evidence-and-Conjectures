To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of the given birth order pattern and then use it to estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

Assuming that the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely, the probability of the birth order pattern B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can use the following formula:

Number of families with birth order B G B B B B = (1/64) × Total number of families surveyed

Since the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we can't directly calculate the answer. However, we can express the answer in the following format:

{answer: (1/64) × Total number of families surveyed}
