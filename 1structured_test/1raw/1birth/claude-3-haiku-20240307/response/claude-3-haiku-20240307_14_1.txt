To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific order of births.

Given the information that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can assume that the total number of families surveyed is not known.

The probability of having a B G B B B B order of births can be calculated as follows:

The probability of having a boy as the first child is 1/2.
The probability of having a girl as the second child is 1/2.
The probability of having a boy as the third child is 1/2.
The probability of having a boy as the fourth child is 1/2.
The probability of having a boy as the fifth child is 1/2.
The probability of having a boy as the sixth child is 1/2.

Multiplying these probabilities, we get:
(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64

This means that the probability of having a B G B B B B order of births is 1/64 or approximately 0.015625.

Given that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as:

{answer: 45 * 0.015625 â‰ˆ 0.703125 (rounded to 1)}

Note that since the number of families surveyed is not provided, the estimate is based on the assumption that the probability of each order of births is equally likely.
