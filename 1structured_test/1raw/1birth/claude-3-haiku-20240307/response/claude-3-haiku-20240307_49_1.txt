To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can make the following assumptions:

1. The total number of families surveyed is not provided, but we know that 45 families had the order of births as G B G B B G.
2. The remaining families must have had a different order of births.
3. The order of births B G B B B B is one of the possible orders that the remaining families could have.

Given this information, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

{answer: 15}

The reasoning is as follows:

If there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and the total number of families is unknown, then the remaining families must have had a different order of births.

The order B G B B B B is one of the possible orders that the remaining families could have. Assuming that the orders are equally likely, we can estimate that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is approximately 1/3 of the remaining families, which would be 15.

This is a rough estimate based on the information provided, and the actual number could vary depending on the total number of families surveyed and the distribution of birth orders among the remaining families.
