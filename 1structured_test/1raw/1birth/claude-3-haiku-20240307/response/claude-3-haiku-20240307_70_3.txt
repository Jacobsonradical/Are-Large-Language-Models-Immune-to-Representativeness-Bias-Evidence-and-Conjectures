To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of combinations and permutations.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- We need to estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible permutations of 6 children, with 3 boys and 3 girls.
Total number of permutations = 6! / (3! × 3!) = 20

Step 2: Assume that the proportion of families with the order B G B B B B is the same as the proportion of permutations with this order.
Proportion of permutations with B G B B B B order = 1 / 20

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.
Estimated number of families = 45 × (1 / 20) = 2.25

Therefore, the answer is:
{answer: 2}
