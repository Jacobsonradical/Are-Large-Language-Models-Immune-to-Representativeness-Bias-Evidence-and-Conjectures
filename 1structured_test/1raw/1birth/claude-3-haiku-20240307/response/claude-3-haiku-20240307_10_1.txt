To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions.

Assuming that the gender of each child is independent and the probability of a boy or a girl is equally likely (0.5 each), we can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of this birth order.

The probability of the birth order B G B B B B is:
P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 0.015625

Given that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed. Assuming that the birth orders are equally likely, the total number of families surveyed would be:

Total families surveyed = 45 / 0.015625 = 2,880

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
