To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information provided about the 45 families where the order was G B G B B G.

The total number of families surveyed is not given, but we can make an assumption based on the information provided.

Since the order of births in the 45 families was G B G B B G, we can assume that the order B G B B B B is equally likely to occur among the remaining families.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 45}
