To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this order occurring.

The probability of a particular order of births (either all boys or a mix of boys and girls) can be calculated using the binomial probability formula.

The probability of a B G B B B B order is:
(6 choose 1) × (5 choose 1) × (4 choose 1) × (3 choose 3) / (6 choose 6) = 0.0104

Assuming that the order of births is equally likely for all families, we can estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B order as follows:

{answer: 45 × 0.0104 = 0.468 (rounded to 0)}

Note: Since the result is less than 1, the estimated number of families with the B G B B B B order is 0.
