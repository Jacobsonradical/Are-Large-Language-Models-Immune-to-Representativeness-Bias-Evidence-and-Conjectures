To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B, given that we have information about the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

The total number of families surveyed is not given, so we cannot directly calculate the number of families with the order B G B B B B. Instead, we can estimate the probability of this order of births and then use it to estimate the number of families.

The probability of a family having the order B G B B B B is the product of the probabilities of having a boy first, then a girl, then 4 boys. Assuming equal probability of having a boy or a girl, the probability of this order is:

P(B G B B B B) = 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/64

Given that 45 families have the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as 45 / (1/64) = 2,880.

The estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B is then:

{answer: 45}
