To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information provided about the 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

Given that the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we can make an estimate based on the proportion of families with the G B G B B G order.

Assuming that the order of births is equally likely for all families, the probability of a family having the G B G B B G order is 1/64 (since there are 64 possible permutations of 6 children, and only one of them is G B G B B G).

If 45 families have the G B G B B G order, and this represents 1/64 of the total number of families, then the estimated total number of families surveyed is:

{answer: 45 Ã— 64 = 2,880}
