To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B, given the information that 45 families had the order G B G B B G.

Since the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we cannot give an exact estimate of the number of families with the order B G B B B B. However, we can provide an estimate based on the information given.

Assuming that the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely, the probability of the order B G B B B B is 1/64, as there are 6 children and the order of boys and girls is fixed.

Given that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

{answer: 45 * (1/64) â‰ˆ 0.703}

This estimate assumes that the probabilities of the different birth orders are independent and that the sample size is large enough to reflect the underlying probabilities.
