To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make an assumption about the distribution of the birth order of boys and girls in the families.

Given that 45 families had the exact order of births as G B G B B G, we can assume that the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely in the remaining families.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 45}
