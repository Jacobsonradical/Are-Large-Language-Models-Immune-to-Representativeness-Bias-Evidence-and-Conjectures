To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific order of births.

Assuming that the births of boys and girls are independent events with equal probability, the probability of this order of birth can be calculated as follows:

P(B G B B B B) = P(B) × P(G) × P(B) × P(B) × P(B) × P(B)
= (1/2)^6 = 1/64

This means that the probability of a family having this exact order of births is 1/64.

Given that there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by using the following proportion:

45 families with order G B G B B G / 1 (the probability of this order) = X families with order B G B B B B / 1/64 (the probability of this order)

Solving for X, we get:

X = (45 × 1/64) = 0.703125

Since we cannot have a fractional number of families, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number:
