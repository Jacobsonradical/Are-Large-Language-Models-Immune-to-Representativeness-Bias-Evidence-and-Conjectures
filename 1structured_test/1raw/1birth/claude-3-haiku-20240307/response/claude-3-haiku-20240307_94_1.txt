To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the order of births being B G B B B B in a family of six children.

Given information:
- The survey was conducted on all families of six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

The probability of the order of births being B G B B B B in a family of six children can be calculated as follows:

Probability of the order B G B B B B = 1/64

This is because there are 2^6 = 64 possible combinations of boys and girls in a family of six children, and only one of them is B G B B B B.

To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can multiply the probability by the total number of families surveyed.

However, the total number of families surveyed is not given in the problem statement. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise estimate.
