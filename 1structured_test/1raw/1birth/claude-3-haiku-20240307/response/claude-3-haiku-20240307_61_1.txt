To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions.

Assuming that the gender of each child is independent and equally likely to be a boy or a girl, the probability of the exact order B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Given that there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of that order, which is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

The total number of families surveyed would then be 45 * 64 = 2,880 families.

The number of families with the order B G B B B B would then be 2,880 * (1/64) = 45 families.

Therefore, the answer is:

{answer: 45}
