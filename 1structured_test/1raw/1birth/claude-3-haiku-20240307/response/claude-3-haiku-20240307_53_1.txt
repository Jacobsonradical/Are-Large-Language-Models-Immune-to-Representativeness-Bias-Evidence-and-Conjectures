To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided about the 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

The key observation is that the two birth orders are complementary, meaning that the number of boys and girls in each birth order is the same. Therefore, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is likely to be the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
