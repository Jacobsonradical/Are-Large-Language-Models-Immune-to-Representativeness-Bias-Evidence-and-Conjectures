To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact birth order of B G B B B B among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely, the probability of having the exact order of B G B B B B can be calculated as follows:

Probability of having the exact order of B G B B B B = 1/64 (since there are 6 children, and the probability of having a specific order of 3 boys and 3 girls is 1/64)

The number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B can be estimated as:

{answer: 45 x (1/64) = 0.703125}
