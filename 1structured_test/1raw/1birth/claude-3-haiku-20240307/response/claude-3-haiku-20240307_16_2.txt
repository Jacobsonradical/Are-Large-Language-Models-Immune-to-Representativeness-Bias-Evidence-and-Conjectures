To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of a specific birth order pattern.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the birth order of boys and girls is equally likely, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

The probability of a specific birth order pattern can be calculated using the binomial distribution. The probability of getting a boy or a girl on any given birth is 0.5.

The probability of getting the birth order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

To estimate the number of families with this birth order, we can multiply the total number of families surveyed by the probability of this birth order:

{answer: 45 * 0.015625 = 0.703125}

Note that the result is not an integer, as the exact number of families with this birth order pattern is not provided. This estimate provides a reasonable approximation based on the given information.
