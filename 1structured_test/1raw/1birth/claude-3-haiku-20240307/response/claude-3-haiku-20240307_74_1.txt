To solve this problem, we need to make some assumptions and use combinatorics to estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Assumptions:
1. The total number of families surveyed is unknown, but we can assume it is a large enough number to make the estimates meaningful.
2. The distribution of birth orders is random and independent of the number of children in the family.

Estimation:
The number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B can be estimated using combinatorics.

The number of ways to arrange 6 children as B G B B B B is:
6! / (1! * 5!) = 720

If the distribution of birth orders is random and independent, the proportion of families with the order B G B B B B would be:
720 / (720 + 45) = 0.941 or approximately 94.1%

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 94.1% of the total number of families surveyed}
