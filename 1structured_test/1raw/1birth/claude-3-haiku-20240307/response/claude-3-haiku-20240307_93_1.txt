To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

The probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:

P(B G B B B B) = (6 choose 5) * (1/2)^6 = 6/64 = 15/160

Now, to estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can multiply the total number of families surveyed by the probability:

Total number of families surveyed = unknown
Probability of B G B B B B = 15/160

Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = (Total number of families surveyed) * (15/160)

Since the total number of families surveyed is not given, we cannot provide a specific estimate. However, we can present the answer in the requested format as follows:

{answer: (Total number of families surveyed) * (15/160)}
