To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of a specific birth order occurring.

Given information:
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

We can use this information to estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each), the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Since the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we can use the given information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. We know that in 45 families, the birth order was G B G B B G, so the total number of families surveyed is at least 45.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45 Ã— 0.015625 = approximately 0.703 families}
