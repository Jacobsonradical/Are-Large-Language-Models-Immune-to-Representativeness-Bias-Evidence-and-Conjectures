To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific birth order pattern.

Given that the survey was conducted for all families of six children in the city, and 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, we can assume that the remaining families had different birth order patterns.

Since the total number of families is not provided, we cannot determine the exact number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. However, we can provide an estimate based on the information given.

Assuming that the birth order patterns are equally likely, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is 1/6 (since there are 6 possible birth orders for 6 children).

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45 / 6 = 7.5}

Please note that this is an estimate, as the actual number of families with this birth order pattern cannot be determined without more information about the total number of families surveyed.
