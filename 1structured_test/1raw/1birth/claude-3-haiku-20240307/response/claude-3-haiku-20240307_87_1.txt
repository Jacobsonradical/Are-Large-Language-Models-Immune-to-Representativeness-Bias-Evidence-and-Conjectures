To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of the given birth order pattern occurring in a family with six children.

The probability of the birth order G B G B B G in a family with six children is given as 45 families out of the total number of families surveyed.

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to calculate the probability of this pattern and then apply it to the total number of families surveyed.

The probability of the birth order B G B B B B in a family with six children is:
(1/2)^6 = 1/64

Assuming the total number of families surveyed is N, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:
(1/64) * N

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{answer: (1/64) * N}
