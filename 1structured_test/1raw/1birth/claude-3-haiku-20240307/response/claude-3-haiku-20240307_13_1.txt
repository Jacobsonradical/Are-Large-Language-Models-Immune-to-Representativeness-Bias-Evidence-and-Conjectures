To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information provided about the 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

Given:
- There are 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

Assuming that the order of births is equally likely for each family, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

The total number of possible birth orders for a family with six children is 6! = 720.

The number of families with the order B G B B B B is 1 out of the 720 possible orders.

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45 / 720}
