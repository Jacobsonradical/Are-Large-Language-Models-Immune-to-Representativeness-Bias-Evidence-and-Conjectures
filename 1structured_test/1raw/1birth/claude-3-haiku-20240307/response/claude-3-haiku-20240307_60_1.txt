To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information provided about the 45 families where the order was G B G B B G.

Given the information:
- There are 45 families where the order of births was G B G B B G.
- We need to estimate the number of families where the order was B G B B B B.

Assuming that the birth order is equally likely for all families, we can use the following logic:

There are 6 children in each family, and the order of births can be any of the 6! = 720 possible permutations.
The number of families with the order G B G B B G is 45.
The number of families with the order B G B B B B is the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G, since the order is equally likely.

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
