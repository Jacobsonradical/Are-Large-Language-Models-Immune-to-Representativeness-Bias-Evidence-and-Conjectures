To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific birth order occurring.

Given that the survey was conducted on all families of six children in the city, we can assume that the probability of any particular birth order is equally likely.

The probability of the birth order B G B B B B is 1 out of the total number of possible birth orders for six children, which is 6! = 720.

Since the question states that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, the remaining families must have had other birth orders.

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 720 - 45 = 675}
