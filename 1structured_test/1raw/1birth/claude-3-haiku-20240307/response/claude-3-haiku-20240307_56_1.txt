To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the births of boys and girls are equally likely, the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = 1/64

Since there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as:

{answer: 45 * (1/64) â‰ˆ 0.703}
