To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the order of births being B G B B B B in a family with six children.

Given information:
- The survey was conducted on all families of six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the order of births B G B B B B, we can use the principle of combinatorics.

The total number of possible orders of births for a family with six children is 2^6 = 64.

The probability of the order of births being B G B B B B is 1/64.

The total number of families surveyed is not given, but we can use the information provided to estimate it.

Since 45 families had the order of births G B G B B G, the remaining families must have had other orders of births.

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 1/64 * (total number of families surveyed - 45)}
