To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact birth order of B G B B B B among the total number of families surveyed.

Given information:
- There were 45 families with the exact birth order of G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

Let's assume the total number of families surveyed is N.

The probability of a family having the exact birth order of B G B B B B is:
P(B G B B B B) = (1/64) (since there are 64 possible birth order combinations for 6 children)

Since there were 45 families with the exact birth order of G B G B B G, the number of families with the exact birth order of B G B B B B can be estimated as:
Number of families with B G B B B B = (45 / (1/64)) × (1/64) = 45 × 64 = 2,880

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 2,880}
