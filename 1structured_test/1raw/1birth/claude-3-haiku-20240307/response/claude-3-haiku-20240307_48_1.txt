To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of getting the exact order of births as B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the births of boys and girls are equally likely, the probability of getting the order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since the total number of families surveyed is not given, we can only provide an estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is 1000. Then, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 15.625}

This is calculated as 1000 Ã— (1/64) = 15.625 families.
