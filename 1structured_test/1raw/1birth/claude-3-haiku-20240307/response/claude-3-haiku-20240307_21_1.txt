To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of this specific birth order occurring.

Given information:
- There were 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

Assuming that the gender of each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Since the total number of families surveyed is not given, we cannot directly calculate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. However, we can provide an estimate based on the information provided.

The estimate can be calculated as follows:

{answer: 45 / 64}

This estimate assumes that the probabilities of the different birth orders are equally likely among the families surveyed.
