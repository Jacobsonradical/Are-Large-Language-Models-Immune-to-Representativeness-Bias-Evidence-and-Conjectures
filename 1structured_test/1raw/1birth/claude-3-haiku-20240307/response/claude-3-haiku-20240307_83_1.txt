To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information given about the 45 families where the order was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the distribution of birth orders is uniform across all families, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

{answer: 45}

This is because the total number of possible birth orders for 6 children is 6! = 720, and the order B G B B B B is one of the 720 possible orders. Since the 45 families with the order G B G B B G represent 45/720 = 1/16 of the total families, we can estimate that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is also 1/16 of the total, which is 45.
