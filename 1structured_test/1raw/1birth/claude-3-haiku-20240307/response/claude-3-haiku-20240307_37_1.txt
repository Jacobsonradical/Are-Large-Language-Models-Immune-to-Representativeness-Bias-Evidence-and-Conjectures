To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the exact order of births as G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B, we can use the principle of equally likely outcomes.

The probability of having a boy or a girl at each birth is 0.5 (assuming equal probability).

The probability of having the exact order of births as B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

Assuming that the total number of families surveyed is N, the number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is estimated to be:

{answer: N * 0.015625}
