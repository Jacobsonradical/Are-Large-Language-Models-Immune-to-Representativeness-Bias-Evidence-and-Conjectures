To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the given information about the families with the order G B G B B G.

Given information:
- There are 45 families with the order of births G B G B B G.

Since the question does not provide the total number of families surveyed, we cannot determine the exact number of families with the order B G B B B B. However, we can provide an estimate based on the given information.

Assuming that the order of births is equally likely among the families, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

{answer: 45}

The reasoning behind this estimate is that if the order of births is equally likely, then the number of families with the order B G B B B B should be the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G, which is 45.

This is an estimate because the actual number of families with the order B G B B B B may be different, depending on the total number of families surveyed and the actual distribution of birth orders among the families.
