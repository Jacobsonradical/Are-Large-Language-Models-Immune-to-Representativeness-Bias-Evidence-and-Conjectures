To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the overall distribution of birth orders among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the birth order patterns are evenly distributed among the families surveyed, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

Let the total number of families surveyed be x.

Since the order G B G B B G was observed in 45 families, we can assume that the other possible orders are also equally likely.

There are 6 possible birth order patterns for 6 children: G B G B B G, G B G B G B, G B G G B B, B G B B B B, B G B B G B, and B G B G B B.

If the patterns are evenly distributed, then each pattern would be observed in x/6 families.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B would be:

{answer: x/6}
