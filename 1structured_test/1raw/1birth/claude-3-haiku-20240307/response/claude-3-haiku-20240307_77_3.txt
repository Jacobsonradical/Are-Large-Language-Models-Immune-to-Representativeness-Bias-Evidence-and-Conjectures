To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact birth order of B G B B B B, and then multiply it by the total number of families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

Let's assume the total number of families surveyed is N.

The probability of a family having the exact birth order of B G B B B B is 1/64, as there are 6 children and the probability of each birth (boy or girl) is 1/2.

The estimate of the number of families with the exact birth order of B G B B B B is:

{answer: (1/64) * N}
