To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B, given the information about the 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is N.

The probability of the exact order of births being G B G B B G in a family is 1/6! = 1/720.

Given that 45 families had this order, we can set up the following equation:

45 = (N)(1/720)

Solving for N, we get:

N = 45 * 720 = 32,400

Now, the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B in a family is 1/6! = 1/720.

To estimate the number of families with this order, we can multiply the total number of families (32,400) by the probability:
