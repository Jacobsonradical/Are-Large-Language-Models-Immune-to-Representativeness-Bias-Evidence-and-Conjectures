To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact birth order of B G B B B B among the families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

The total number of families surveyed is not given, so we cannot directly calculate the number of families with the B G B B B B birth order. However, we can estimate the probability of this birth order and then use it to estimate the number of families.

The probability of a family having the B G B B B B birth order can be calculated as follows:
Probability of B G B B B B = 1/64 (since there are 6 children, and the probability of each birth order is 1/64)

Using this probability, we can estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B birth order as:
{answer: 45 Ã— (1/64) = 0.703125}

The answer is rounded to 3 decimal places.
