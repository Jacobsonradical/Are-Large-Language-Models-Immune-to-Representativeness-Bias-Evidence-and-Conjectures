To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of the given order of births (G B G B B G) and the probability of the order (B G B B B B).

Given information:
- The survey was conducted among all families of six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

We can estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B using the following approach:

1. Calculate the probability of the order G B G B B G:
   The probability of a particular order of births (6 children) is 1/2^6 = 1/64.

2. Calculate the probability of the order B G B B B B:
   The probability of a particular order of births (6 children) is also 1/2^6 = 1/64.

3. Assume that the probabilities of the two orders are equal:
   Since the survey was conducted among all families of six children in the city, we can assume that the probability of each order of births is the same.

4. Estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B:
   If the probability of the order G B G B B G is the same as the probability of the order B G B B B B, then the number of families with the order B G B B B B is also 45.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
