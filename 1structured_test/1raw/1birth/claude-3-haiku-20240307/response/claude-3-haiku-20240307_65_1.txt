To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information provided about the families where the order was G B G B B G.

Given:
- 45 families had the order G B G B B G.

Assuming the total number of families surveyed is N, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

Let's consider the total number of possible birth order combinations for a family of six children. There are 2^6 = 64 possible combinations, and each combination is equally likely.

The number of families with the order B G B B B B is 1 out of the 64 possible combinations.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: N / 64}

where N is the total number of families surveyed.
