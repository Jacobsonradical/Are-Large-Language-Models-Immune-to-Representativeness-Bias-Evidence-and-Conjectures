To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions about the distribution of birth orders in the city.

One way to approach this problem is to assume that the births of boys and girls are independent and equally likely events. Under this assumption, the probability of a specific birth order sequence can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

The probability of the birth order B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

If we assume that the 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G represent a random sample of all the families in the city, we can estimate the total number of families in the city by dividing 45 by the probability of that birth order sequence, which is 1/16.

Therefore, the total number of families surveyed in the city would be 45 * 16 = 720.

The probability of the birth order B G B B B B is 1/64, so the estimated number of families with that birth order would be 720 * 1/64 = 11.25.

Rounding this to the nearest integer, the answer is:
