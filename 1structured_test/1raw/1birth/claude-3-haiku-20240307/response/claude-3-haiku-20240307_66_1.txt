To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information given about the 45 families where the order was G B G B B G.

Since the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we cannot directly calculate the number of families with the order B G B B B B. However, we can make an estimate based on the given information.

Assuming that the distribution of birth orders in the city is relatively uniform, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is N.

The number of families with the order G B G B B G is given as 45.

The number of families with the order B G B B B B can be estimated as:

(Number of families with B G B B B B) = (45 / 6) = 7.5

Since we cannot have a fractional number of families, we can round this estimate to the nearest whole number, which is:

{answer: 8}

This is an estimate based on the assumption of a uniform distribution of birth orders in the city.
