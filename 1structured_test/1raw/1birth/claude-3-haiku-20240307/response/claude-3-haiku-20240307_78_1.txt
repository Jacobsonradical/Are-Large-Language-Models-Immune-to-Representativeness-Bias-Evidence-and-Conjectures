To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B and then multiply it by the total number of families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

The probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B is the product of the probabilities of each birth being a boy or girl.

The probability of the first birth being a boy is 1/2.
The probability of the second birth being a girl is 1/2.
The probability of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth births being boys is (1/2)^4 = 1/16.

The total probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B is:
(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/16) = 1/64

Now, to estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we multiply the total number of families surveyed by the probability of having that exact order of births.

The total number of families surveyed is not given, but we can estimate it based on the information provided.

Since 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that the total number of families surveyed is at least 45.

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
{answer: 45 × (1/64) = approximately 0.703 families}
