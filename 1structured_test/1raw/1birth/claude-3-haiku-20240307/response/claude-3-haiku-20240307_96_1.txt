To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the principle of combinatorics.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

To calculate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of this specific order of births.

Assuming that the total number of families surveyed is N, the probability of the order B G B B B B is:

P(B G B B B B) = (6 choose 6) / (6 choose 6) = 1

Therefore, the number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

{answer: N}

Note: The actual number of families with the order B G B B B B cannot be determined from the given information alone. The total number of families surveyed (N) is not provided, so we can only provide an estimate for the answer.
