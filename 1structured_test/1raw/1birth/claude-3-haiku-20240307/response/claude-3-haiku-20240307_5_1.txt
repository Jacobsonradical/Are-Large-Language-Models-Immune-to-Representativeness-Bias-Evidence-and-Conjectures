To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of a family having the birth order B G B B B B, given that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G.

The total number of families surveyed is not explicitly given, but we can use the information provided to estimate it.

Given:
- 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (i.e., 0.5 for each), we can calculate the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B.

The probability of having the birth order B G B B B B is (0.5)^6 = 0.015625.

We can then use this probability to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, given that there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B = 45 × 0.015625 ≈ 0.703 families.

Since the question requires the answer to be in the specified format, the final answer is:

{answer: 0.703}
