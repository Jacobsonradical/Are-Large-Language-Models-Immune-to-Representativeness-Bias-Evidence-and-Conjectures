To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific order of births occurring.

Given information:
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

Assuming that the births of boys and girls are equally likely, the probability of the order B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Since the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we can only estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B based on the given information.

The estimate can be calculated as follows:

{answer: 45 / 64 â‰ˆ 0.703 families}

This means that based on the given information, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is approximately 0.703 families.
