To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of the given birth order pattern, B G B B B B, and then estimate the number of families surveyed with this pattern.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact order of births of boys (B) and girls (G) was G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

The probability of the birth order pattern B G B B B B can be calculated as follows:
Probability of the first child being a boy = 1/2
Probability of the second child being a girl = 1/2
Probability of the third child being a boy = 1/2
Probability of the fourth child being a boy = 1/2
Probability of the fifth child being a boy = 1/2
Probability of the sixth child being a boy = 1/2
Total probability = 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/64

To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order pattern B G B B B B, we can use the following formula:

Estimated number of families = (1/64) × Total number of families surveyed

Since the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we cannot give an exact answer. However, we can provide an estimate based on the given information.

{answer: Unknown}

The reason the answer is "Unknown" is that the total number of families surveyed is not provided in the problem statement. Without this information, it is not possible to estimate the number of families with the birth order pattern B G B B B B.
