To solve this problem, we need to estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Given information:
- The survey was conducted on all families of six children in a city.
- In 45 families, the exact order of births of boys (B) and girls (G) was G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can use the fact that the total number of possible birth orders for six children (three boys and three girls) is 6! = 720.

Since the problem states that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, the remaining families must have had different birth orders.

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 720 - 45 = 675}
