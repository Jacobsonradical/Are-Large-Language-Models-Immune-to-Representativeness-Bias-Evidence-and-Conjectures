To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to use the given information and make some assumptions.

Assuming that the distribution of birth orders is independent of the number of children in the family, we can use the following approach:

The total number of families surveyed is not given, but we know that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G.

If we assume that the probability of any birth order is equal, then the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is 1/64 (since there are 6 children, and each can be either a boy or a girl, resulting in 64 possible birth orders).

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B can be calculated as:

{answer: 45 / 64}
