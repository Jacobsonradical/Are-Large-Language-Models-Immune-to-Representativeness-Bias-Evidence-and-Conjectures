To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of a family having the exact birth order of B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Since the problem does not provide the total number of families surveyed, we cannot directly calculate the number of families with the B G B B B B birth order. However, we can estimate the probability of a family having this birth order and then multiply it by the total number of families to get the estimate.

The probability of a family having the B G B B B B birth order can be calculated as follows:
Probability = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Assuming that the total number of families surveyed is N, the estimated number of families with the B G B B B B birth order would be:
{answer: (1/64) * N}
