To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information provided about the 45 families with the order G B G B B G.

Assuming that the distribution of birth orders is random and independent of the number of children in the family, we can estimate the probability of the order B G B B B B occurring.

The probability of a specific birth order with 6 children can be calculated as 1/6! = 1/720.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed with the order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45 Ã— (1/720)}
