To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the probability of the exact order of births being B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

The total number of families surveyed is not provided, but we can use the information given to estimate it.

Since the order of births G B G B B G was observed in 45 families, we can assume that this is a significant portion of the total number of families surveyed.

To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the principle of symmetry. Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, the probability of the order B G B B B B is the same as the probability of the order G B G B B G.

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
