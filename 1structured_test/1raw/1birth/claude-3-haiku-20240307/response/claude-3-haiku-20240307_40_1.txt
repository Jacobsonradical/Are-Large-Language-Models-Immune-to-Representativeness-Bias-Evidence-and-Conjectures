To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific order occurring.

Given information:
- 45 families were surveyed where the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50% each), the probability of the order B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45 Ã— (1/64) = approximately 0.7}
