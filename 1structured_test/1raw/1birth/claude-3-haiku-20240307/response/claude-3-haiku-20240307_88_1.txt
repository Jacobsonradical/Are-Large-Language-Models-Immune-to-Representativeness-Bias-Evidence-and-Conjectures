To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information provided about the 45 families where the order was G B G B B G.

Given that the total number of families surveyed is not provided, we can make the following assumptions:

1. The distribution of birth orders is likely to be similar across all families, regardless of the total number of families surveyed.
2. The probability of each birth order pattern is independent of the other families.

Under these assumptions, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

Let's assume the total number of families surveyed is N.

The probability of the order G B G B B G is 45/N.

The probability of the order B G B B B B is the same as the probability of the order G B G B B G, since the two orders are equally likely.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B is:
