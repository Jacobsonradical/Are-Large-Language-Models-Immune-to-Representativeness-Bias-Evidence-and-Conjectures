To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B and then multiply it by the total number of families surveyed.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not given.

Let's assume the total number of families surveyed is N.

The probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:
{answer: N/64}
