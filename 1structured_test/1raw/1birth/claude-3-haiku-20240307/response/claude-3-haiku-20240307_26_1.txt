To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of families surveyed and the proportion of families with the given birth order.

Given information:
- There were 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- The total number of families surveyed is not provided.

Since the total number of families surveyed is not given, we cannot determine the exact number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. However, we can estimate the number based on the information provided.

Assuming that the birth orders are equally likely, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is the same as the probability of the birth order G B G B B G, which is 1/6.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B can be calculated as:

{answer: 45 / 6 = 7.5}

Note that the answer is an estimate, as the total number of families surveyed is not provided.
