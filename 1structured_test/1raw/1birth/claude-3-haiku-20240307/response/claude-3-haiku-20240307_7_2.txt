To solve this problem, we need to estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Given information:
- There are 45 families in which the exact order of births was G B G B B G.

To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probability.

The probability of having a specific order of births (either G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is the same, assuming that the sex of each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl.

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the order B G B B B B can be calculated as:

{answer: 45}
