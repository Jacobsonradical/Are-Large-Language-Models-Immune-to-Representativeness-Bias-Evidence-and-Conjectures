To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a family having the exact order of births as B G B B B B, given the information provided.

Given information:
- There are 45 families where the exact order of births was G B G B B G.
- We want to estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B.

Assuming that the gender of the children is randomly distributed, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of having the B G B B B B order.

The probability of having a boy (B) is 0.5, and the probability of having a girl (G) is also 0.5.

The probability of having the B G B B B B order is:
P(B G B B B B) = (6 choose 5) * (0.5)^6 = 0.015625

This means that the probability of a family having the B G B B B B order is approximately 0.015625 or 1.56%.

To estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B order, we can use the following formula:

{answer: 45 * 0.015625 = 0.703125 â‰ˆ 1}

The estimated number of families with the exact order of births as B G B B B B is approximately 1.
