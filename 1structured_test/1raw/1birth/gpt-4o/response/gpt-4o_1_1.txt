To determine the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to compare the probability of each specific birth sequence.

Each child has an equal probability (1/2) of being a boy or a girl. For a family of six children, there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible birth sequences.

The probability of any specific sequence (such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B) occurring is:

\[
P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Given that the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, this allows us to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Let's denote the total number of surveyed families as \(N\).

\[
\frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Solving for \(N\):

\[
N = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

Therefore, there were approximately 2880 families surveyed.

Given this total number, we now estimate the number of families in which the specific sequence B G B B B B occurred. Since the probability of this sequence is also \(\frac{1}{64}\):

\[
\frac{N}{64} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45
\]

Therefore, my estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
