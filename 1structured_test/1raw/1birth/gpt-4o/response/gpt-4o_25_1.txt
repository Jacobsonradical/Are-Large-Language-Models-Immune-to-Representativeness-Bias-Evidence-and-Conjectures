To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can start by calculating the probability of this specific birth order.

Each child being a boy (B) or a girl (G) is assumed to be independent events with an equal probability of 0.5 each.

The probability of the specific order G B G B B G (from one of the 45 families) is:
\[ P(G B G B B G) = (0.5)^6 = 1/64 \]

Given that 45 families had the birth sequence G B G B B G, we can use this occurrence to estimate the total number of families surveyed:
\[ \text{Total Families} \approx 45 \times 64 \]

Now, letâ€™s find the probability of the birth sequence B G B B B B:
\[ P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 1/64 \]

Using this total number of families surveyed, the expected number of families with the birth sequence B G B B B B would be:
\[ \text{Estimated Families with B G B B B B} = \frac{\text{Total Families}}{64} \]

Substituting the estimated total number of families:
\[ \text{Estimated Families with B G B B B B} = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
{answer: 45}
