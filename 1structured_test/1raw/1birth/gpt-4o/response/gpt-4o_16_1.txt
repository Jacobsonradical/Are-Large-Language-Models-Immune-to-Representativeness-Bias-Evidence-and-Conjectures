Given that the exact order of births in 45 families is G B G B B G, we need to estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births is B G B B B B.

First, let's calculate the total number of possible birth orders for a family of six children. Each birth is either a boy (B) or a girl (G), yielding \(2^6 = 64\) possible birth sequences.

Each unique birth sequence is equally likely. Therefore, the fraction of families with the exact order G B G B B G is \(\frac{1}{64}\).

If 45 families have the birth sequence G B G B B G, we can calculate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

\[ \frac{45}{\frac{1}{64}} = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \text{ families} \]

Now, we need to find the number of families with the birth sequence B G B B B B, which also has a probability of \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Therefore, the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:

\[ \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Thus, the estimate of the number of families surveyed with the birth sequence B G B B B B is:
