To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, you can use the information given:

In 45 families, the exact order was G B G B B G. 

We assume that the likelihood of having a boy or a girl in each birth is independent and equally likely (i.e., each has a probability of \(\frac{1}{2}\)). The probability of a specific sequence of births for six children is therefore \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}\).

Since the number of families exhibiting the sequence G B G B B G is known (45 families), this can be used to find the total number of families surveyed. We denote this total number as \(N\).

Let's calculate \(N\):
If the exact order G B G B B G has a probability of \(\frac{1}{64}\) and occurs in 45 families, the total number of families \(N\) can be estimated as follows:

\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Given \(N = 2880\), the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B can be estimated similarly. The probability of B G B B B B occurring is also \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Therefore, the expected number of such families is:

\[ \frac{N}{64} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

So, the estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.
