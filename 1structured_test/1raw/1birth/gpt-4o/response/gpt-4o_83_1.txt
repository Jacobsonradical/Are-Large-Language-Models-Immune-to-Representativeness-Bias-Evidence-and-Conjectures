To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of each specific birth sequence occurring. 

The births of boys and girls can be thought of as Bernoulli trials with each child having a probability of 0.5 of being a boy (B) or a girl (G) independently of the others.

The sequence "G B G B B G" is one specific outcome among \(2^6 = 64\) possible birth sequences for six children.

Given that there are 45 families where the birth order is "G B G B B G," this suggests that for each specific sequence of births, there are 45 families out of 64 possible sequences. 

Now, we need to calculate the corresponding number for the sequence "B G B B B B." Assuming that the same ratio holds for a different specific sequence:

\[
\text{Estimated number of families} = \frac{45}{64} \times 64 = 45
\]

Thus, our estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.
