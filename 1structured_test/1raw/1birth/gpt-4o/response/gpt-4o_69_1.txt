To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births is B G B B B B, we can use the idea that every specific sequence of births (like G B G B B G) should occur with approximately the same probability if the distribution of boys and girls is random and each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl.

1. Each specific sequence of 6 births is equally likely. There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of 6 births (each birth being either a boy or a girl).

2. Given that one specific sequence (G B G B B G) occurred in 45 families, we assume that any other specific sequence would occur with roughly the same frequency.

Thus, the number of families in which the exact order of births is B G B B B B should also be approximately:
\[ 45 \]

So, the estimate is:
