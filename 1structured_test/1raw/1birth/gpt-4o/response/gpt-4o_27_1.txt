To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to assume the birth of a boy or girl is equally likely, with a probability of 0.5 for either sex at each birth.

Given the total number of families with six children:
- Each specific sequence of births is equally likely.
- The probability of any specific sequence of births (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is \( (0.5)^6 \).

Since there are \( 2^6 = 64 \) possible sequences for the birth order of six children (each child being either a boy or a girl and each sequence being equally likely):

1. The probability of any one specific sequence, like G B G B B G, is \( \frac{1}{64} \).
2. Since 45 families had the specific sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed.

Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. Then:

\[
\frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Solving for \( N \):

\[
N = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

Based on this total, we estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B:

\[
\text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45
\]

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed with the exact order of births B G B B B B is:
