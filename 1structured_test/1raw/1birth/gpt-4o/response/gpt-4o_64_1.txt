To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can start by considering the probabilities. 

Given that there are 45 families in which the specific order G B G B B G occurred, we need to determine the probability of this particular sequence and then extend the logic to B G B B B B.

1. Each child being a boy or a girl is equally probable, so each sequence of births has a probability of \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

2. The number of possible sequences of 6 children is \( 2^6 = 64 \).

3. If the occurrence probability for G B G B B G matches B G B B B B, then both sequences have the same probability: \( \frac{1}{64} \).

Since the problem approach implies the same number of repetitions for any specific sequence in a large enough sample due to the equal probability:

4. 45 families corresponds to the likelihood \( \frac{45}{\text{total number of families}} \).

5. Letting \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed, we set up the equation:

\[ \frac{N}{64} = 45 \]

6. Solving for \( N \):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

This implies there were approximately 2880 families surveyed.

7. Therefore, the estimate of families with the sequence B G B B B B:

\[ \text{Estimated number} = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

So the answer is:
