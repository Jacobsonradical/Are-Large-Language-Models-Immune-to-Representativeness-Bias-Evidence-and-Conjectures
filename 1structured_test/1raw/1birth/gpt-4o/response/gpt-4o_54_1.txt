To estimate the number of families surveyed where the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can rely on the assumption that each birth is equally likely to be a boy or a girl and that the sequence of genders is random.

The probability of any specific sequence of six children being G B G B B G is (1/2)^6. This is the same probability as any other specific sequence, such as B G B B B B.

Given that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this to estimate the total number of families surveyed. 

So, if 45 families represent the outcome for one specific sequence, the number of families with any specific sequence, like B G B B B B, would likely be the same.

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed with the sequence B G B B B B is:
