To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can assume that each sequence of six children with specified gender probabilities is equally likely.

There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of births (since each child can be either a boy or a girl, and there are six children in total).

Given that in 45 families, the order was G B G B B G, the number of occurrences of any specific sequence such as B G B B B B should be approximately the same due to the assumption of equally likely sequences.

Hence, if one specific sequence (G B G B B G) occurred 45 times, we can expect that any other sequence, such as B G B B B B, would also occur approximately 45 times.

So the estimate is:
