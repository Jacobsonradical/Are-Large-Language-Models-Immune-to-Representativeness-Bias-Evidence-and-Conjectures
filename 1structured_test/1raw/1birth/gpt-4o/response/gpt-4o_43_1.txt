To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to first understand the probability of each specific birth order for a family with six children. 

Since each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of births over six children is:

\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that 45 families were observed to have the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. If we let \( N \) represent the total number of families surveyed, the probability \( \frac{45}{N} \) should equal the probability of the specific sequence G B G B B G:

\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \( N \):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

So, the total number of families surveyed is estimated to be 2880.

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the specific birth order B G B B B B. Since this is just another specific sequence of six births:

\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
