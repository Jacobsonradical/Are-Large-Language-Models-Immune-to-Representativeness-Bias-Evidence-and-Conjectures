To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can assume that the probability of each child being a boy or a girl is independent and equally likely (i.e., each child has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl).

The probability of a specific birth order of six children is calculated as:

\[
P(\text{specific order}) = (0.5)^6
\]

For both orders (G B G B B G and B G B B B B), the probability is:

\[
P(G B G B B G) = (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Given that there are 45 families with the specific order G B G B B G, we can set up the proportion to estimate the number of families for the order B G B B B B:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of families with } B G B B B B}{\text{Total number of families}} = \frac{1}{64}
\]

We can use the information that 45 families have the order G B G B B G:

\[
\frac{45}{\text{Total number of families}} = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Solving for the total number of families:

\[
\text{Total number of families} = 45 \times 64
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of families:

\[
\text{Total number of families} = 2880
\]

Next, we estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B:

\[
\text{Number of families with } B G B B B B = \frac{2880}{64} = 45
\]

Thus, the estimate for the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B is the same as the number of families with the order G B G B B G.
