To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the assumption that the probability of each child being a boy or a girl is equal, i.e., 0.5 for a boy and 0.5 for a girl.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact order G B G B B G.

The probability of each specific sequence of boys and girls in a family of six children is calculated as follows:
- Each individual child has a 0.5 probability of being either a boy or a girl.
- Therefore, the probability of any specific sequence of 6 children (e.g., G B G B B G) is \( (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Since there are 45 families with the order G B G B B G, and this sequence has the same probability as any other sequence of 6 children:

Estimate of the number of families surveyed:
Total number of families surveyed can be calculated with the proportion method:

Given \( \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \).

Solving for \( N \):
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

With this total number of families surveyed, we can now estimate the families with the specific order B G B B B B.

Using the same probability, each specific sequence of 6 births has a chance of \( \frac{1}{64} \).

Thus, the estimate is:
\[ \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore,
