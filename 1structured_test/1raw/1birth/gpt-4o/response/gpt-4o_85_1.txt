To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births is B G B B B B, let's follow these steps:

1. **Determine the probability of each exact order:**
   - Each child is equally likely to be a boy (B) or a girl (G).
   - The probability of any specific sequence of births, like G B G B B G, is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

2. **Relate given information to determine the total number of families:** 
   - We know that the order G B G B B G occurred in 45 families.

   Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. Since the probability of any specific sequence (like G B G B B G) is \( \frac{1}{64} \), we can express the number of families with this sequence as:
   \[
   N \times \frac{1}{64} = 45.
   \]

   Solving for \( N \):
   \[
   N = 45 \times 64 = 2880.
   \]

   So, the total number of families surveyed is 2880.

3. **Estimate the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B:**
   - Given that each specific sequence has the same probability, we again use the probability \( \left(\frac{1}{64}\right) \).

   The expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:
   \[
   N \times \frac{1}{64} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45.
   \]

Thus, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

\[
\{answer: 45\}
\]
