To answer this question, we need to understand the probability of a specific sequence of births occurring if each child is equally likely to be either a boy or a girl.

Each child being a boy or a girl is an independent event with a probability of 0.5.

The sequence G B G B B G has a probability of occurring given by:
\[ P(\text{G B G B B G}) = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that 45 families had this exact sequence out of the total families surveyed, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (let it be \( N \)) as follows:
\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, we need to find the number of families where the exact sequence is B G B B B B.

The probability of the sequence B G B B B B is also:
\[ P(\text{B G B B B B}) = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

To estimate the number of families with this sequence, we use the same total number of families surveyed:
\[ \frac{X}{2880} = \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ X = \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

Thus, the estimated number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
\[ \{ \text{answer: 45} \} \]
