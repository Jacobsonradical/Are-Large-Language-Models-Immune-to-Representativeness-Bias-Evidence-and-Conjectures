To estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the fact that each specific birth order of six children is equally likely. Each family with six children has \(2^6 = 64\) different possible birth orders.

Given that 45 families out of the surveyed ones had the exact birth order G B G B B G, and knowing each specific birth order is equally likely, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of families surveyed. Let's denote the total number of families surveyed by \(N\).

The probability of one specific birth order occurring is \(\frac{1}{64}\). Therefore, if 45 families had the G B G B B G order:

\[
\frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Solving for \(N\):

\[
N = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

So, the total number of families surveyed is 2880. Now, to find the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we use the same 1 in 64 probability:

\[
\text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45
\]

Thus, our estimate is:
