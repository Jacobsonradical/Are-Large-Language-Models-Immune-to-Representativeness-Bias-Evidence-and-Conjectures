Given the survey in which 45 families had the exact order of births as G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with a different order, such as B G B B B B, by considering the probability of each specific birth order.

The probability of any specific sequence of births with a given number of boys and girls can be calculated assuming that each child has an equal probability (50%) of being a boy or a girl.

1. Calculate the total possible sequences for families with 3 boys and 3 girls. This is given by the binomial coefficient:
   \[
   \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3! \cdot 3!} = 20
   \]

2. Calculate the total possible sequences for families with 5 boys and 1 girl:
   \[
   \binom{6}{1} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = 6
   \]

Given that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, which is only one of the 20 possible sequences with 3 boys and 3 girls, we estimate the total number of families with 3 boys and 3 girls:
   \[
   \text{Total families with 3 boys and 3 girls} = 45 \times 20 = 900
   \]

Assuming a similar proportion, the number of families that would have the sequence B G B B B B, which is one of the 6 possible sequences with 5 boys and 1 girl, can be estimated with the ratio:
   \[
   \text{Families with B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{20} \times 900 = \frac{900}{20} = 45
   \]

The same calculation applies for the specific sequence of 5 boys and 1 girl:
   \[
   \text{Total families with 5 boys and 1 girl} = \left(\frac{1}{6} \times 900\right) = 150
   \]

However, considering each sequence has equivalent probability:

3. Therefore, the number of families expected to have the sequence B G B B B B:
   \[
   \text{Estimation of exact sequence B G B B B B} = \frac{150}{6} = 25
   \]

Thus, our estimate of the number of families which had the exact order of births as B G B B B B is:
