The probability of any specific sequence of genders occurring in a family of six children is equal because each child has an independent 50% chance of being a boy or a girl. 

Therefore, the probability of any specific sequence (e.g., G B G B B G) occurring is:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that this specific sequence (G B G B B G) occurred in 45 families, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by recognizing this same probability applies to any specific birth sequence.

\[ \text{Total families surveyed} \approx 45 \times 64 \]

Now, to find the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we use the same calculation:

\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

So, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
\[ \frac{\text{Total families surveyed}}{64} = 45 \]

Thus, the estimate is:
