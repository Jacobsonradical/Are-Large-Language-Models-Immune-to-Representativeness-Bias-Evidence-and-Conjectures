To determine the estimate, consider that each specific sequence of boys (B) and girls (G) in a family with six children has the same probability. Since the two sequences given, G B G B B G and B G B B B B, both have six births, each specific order is one particular arrangement out of the 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders.

Given that there were 45 families where the specific sequence G B G B B G occurred, and that every specific sequence is equally likely, we can reasonably estimate that there would be roughly the same number of families for any other specific sequence of six children.

Therefore, the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is estimated to be 45.

{answer: 45}
