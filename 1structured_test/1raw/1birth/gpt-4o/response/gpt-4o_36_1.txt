To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can start by calculating the probability of each specific birth order. Each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, therefore each birth order sequence of 6 children has a probability of \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that one specific sequence occurred in 45 families, we can use that to find out how many families were surveyed in total. Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. Since each sequence has the same probability, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Solving for \( N \):

\[
N = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

So, the total number of families surveyed is estimated to be 2880. 

Next, we need to determine the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B. Using the same probability logic, since the probability of each specific sequence is \( \frac{1}{64} \):

\[
\text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{N}{64} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45
\]

Therefore, the estimated number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.
