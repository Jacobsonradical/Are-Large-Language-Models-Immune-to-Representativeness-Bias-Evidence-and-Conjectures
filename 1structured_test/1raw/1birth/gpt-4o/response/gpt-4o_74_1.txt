To estimate the number of families surveyed where the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probabilities of the given sequences and the number of ways they can occur.

The probability of any specific sequence of 6 children (like G B G B B G) occurring is given by \( (1/2)^6 = 1/64 \) assuming an equal chance (50%) of having a boy or girl at each birth.

Given that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. 

If 45 families represents the frequency for the sequence G B G B B G, which has a probability of \( 1/64 \), then the total number of families surveyed (N) can be estimated as:
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]

Now, the probability of the sequence B G B B B B is also \( 1/64 \). Thus, the expected number of families with this specific sequence in the total surveyed population is:
\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{N}{64} \]

Substituting \( N \) back in:
\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
