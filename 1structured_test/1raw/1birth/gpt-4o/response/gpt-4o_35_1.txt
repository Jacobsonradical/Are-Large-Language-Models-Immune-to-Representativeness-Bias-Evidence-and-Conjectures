To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to compare the probabilities of the different birth orders given.

Each child has a 50% chance of being a boy (B) or a girl (G). Therefore, any specific sequence of 6 births (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) will have the same probability. The probability of any specific sequence of 6 births is:

\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that 45 families had the exact order G B G B B G, and assuming that all sequences are equally likely, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of families surveyed:

\[ \frac{45}{\frac{1}{64}} = \frac{45 \times 64}{1} = 2880 \]

This result suggests that 2880 families were likely surveyed in total. Now, to find the number of families where the sequence was B G B B B B:

\[ \text{Number of families with sequence B G B B B B} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

So, the estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
