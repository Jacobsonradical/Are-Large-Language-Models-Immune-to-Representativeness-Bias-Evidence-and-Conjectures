To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the number of possible birth sequences and the probability of any specific one occurring.

In general, for any specific order of births:
- The probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) at any given birth is 1/2.
- Therefore, the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\).

Given that 45 families had the specific order G B G B B G, we assume this distribution follows the probability rule. Hence, the proportion of families with the sequence G B G B B G is 1/64.

Thus, if 45 families represent 1/64 of the total number of families surveyed, we estimate the total number of families surveyed (\(N\)) by solving the equation:
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{64}N \]

Solving for \(N\):
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

So the total number of families surveyed is estimated to be 2880. Now, we calculate how many of these families would have the birth order B G B B B B. Since every specific birth sequence has an equal probability, we again use the 1/64 ratio:
\[ \text{Number of families with sequence B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 \]
\[ \text{Number of families with sequence B G B B B B} = 45 \]

Hence, our estimate is:
