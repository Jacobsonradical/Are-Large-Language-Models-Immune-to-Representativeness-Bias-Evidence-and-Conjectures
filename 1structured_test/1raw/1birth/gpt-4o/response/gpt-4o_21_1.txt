To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we first need to determine the probability of the specific order G B G B B G among six children and use it to infer the total number of families surveyed.

1. **Calculate the probability of the specific order G B G B B G:**

Each child being a boy or a girl is independent and equally likely (assuming equal birth rates for boys and girls), giving a probability of \( \frac{1}{2} \) for each birth.

The specific order G B G B B G has \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \) probability.

2. **Use the given information:**

From the problem, we know that 45 families had the exact order G B G B B G. Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. The expected number of families with the specific order G B G B B G is:
\[ N \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

3. **Solve for \( N \):**

\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

So, the total number of families surveyed is estimated to be 2880.

4. **Calculate the number of families with the specific order B G B B B B:**

The probability for the specific order B G B B B B is also \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \) because each specific order of births is equally likely.

Given \( N = 2880 \), the expected number of families with the specific order B G B B B B is:
\[ 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate is:
