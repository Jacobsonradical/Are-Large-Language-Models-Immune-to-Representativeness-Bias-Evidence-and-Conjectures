To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the ratio of the families given the specific order of births.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Determine the total number of possible birth order sequences for six children. Each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G). The total number of possible sequences is \(2^6 = 64\).

2. The number of ways to have the specific sequence G B G B B G is exactly 1 out of those 64 possible sequences.

3. Let \(N\) be the total number of families surveyed. We are given that 45 families had the specific sequence G B G B B G. This means that the frequency of this specific birth order is \(\frac{45}{N}\).

4. We assume that the probability of each possible sequence is roughly equivalent due to the randomness of births. Therefore, the expected number of families with the specific sequence B G B B B B would also be \(\frac{1}{64}\) of the total families.

Using the ratio and the given information:

\[
\frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \rightarrow N = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

Now, to find the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B:

\[
\text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45
\]

Thus, using the same reasoning as applied to the G B G B B G sequence, we expect the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B to be the same.

Therefore, the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

\[
