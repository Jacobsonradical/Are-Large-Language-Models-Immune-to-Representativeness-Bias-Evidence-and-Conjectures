A scenario where the exact sequence of births results in the order G B G B B G can occur in \((1/2)^6\) of families, since each child has an independent probability of being a boy or a girl, making the probability for any specific sequence of births \(1/2^6\).

Therefore, the probability for the specific sequence G B G B B G is:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Given that 45 families exhibit the specific sequence G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of surveyed families (\(N\)). Let \(N\) be the total number of families surveyed. If \(\frac{1}{64}\) of \(N\) families result in the sequence G B G B B G, then:
\[
\frac{N}{64} = 45
\]

Solving for \(N\):
\[
N = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

Given the total number of surveyed families \(N = 2880\), we now need to estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B. Doing a similar calculation:

The probability of B G B B B B occurring is also \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Thus, the number of families with this sequence is:
\[
\frac{N}{64} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45
\]

So, the estimate for the number of families surveyed with the exact order B G B B B B is:
