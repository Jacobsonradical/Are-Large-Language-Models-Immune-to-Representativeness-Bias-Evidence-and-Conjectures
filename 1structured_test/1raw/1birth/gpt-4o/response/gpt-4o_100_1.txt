To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to calculate the probability of this specific sequence occurring and then apply it to the number of families surveyed.

First, let's determine the probability of the sequence G B G B B G. Each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl, so each birth has a probability of 1/2. For the sequence G B G B B G, the probability is:

\[ \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

We know that this sequence (G B G B B G) occurred in 45 families. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of families surveyed (N):

\[ \frac{1}{64} \times N = 45 \]

Solving for N:

\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Therefore, 2880 families were surveyed in total.

Now, we can use this total number of families to estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B. The probability of this specific sequence (B G B B B B) is:

\[ \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

So we estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B by:

\[ \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Therefore, the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

\[ \{answer: 45\} \]
