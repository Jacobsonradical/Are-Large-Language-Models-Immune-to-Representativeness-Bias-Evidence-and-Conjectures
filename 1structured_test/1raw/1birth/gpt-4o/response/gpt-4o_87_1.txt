The exact order of births G B G B B G appears in 45 families. To estimate how many families had the exact order B G B B B B, we need to consider the number of possible birth orders for six children and the likelihood of each specific sequence.

Each child being a boy or a girl is typically a 50-50 chance, so each sequence of six births can be thought of as equally likely. There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of births for six children.

Assuming every sequence is equally likely, and there are \(45\) families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use a ratio to estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B.

Let \(N\) be the total number of families surveyed.

If \(45\) families have the sequence G B G B B G, which is just one specific sequence out of the \(64\) possibilities, the total number of families surveyed would be estimated as:
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]

So, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B:
\[ \frac{N}{64} = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45 \]

Thus, our estimate is:
