To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the principle of equally likely outcomes for birth orders in a family of six children. 

Each child has two equally likely outcomes: being a boy (B) or a girl (G). Therefore, for a family with six children, there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible birth orders.

Given that the exact order G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can assume that each specific birth order is equally likely.

Thus, the probability of any particular birth order occurring is \(\frac{1}{64}\).

If G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, and assuming the number of families surveyed is N, we have:
\[
\frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Solving for N:
\[
N = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

So, the total number of families surveyed is estimated to be 2880.

Therefore, the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is also:
\[
\frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45
\]

Hence, my estimate of the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B is:
