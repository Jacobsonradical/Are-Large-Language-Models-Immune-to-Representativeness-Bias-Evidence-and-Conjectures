To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B given that in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G, we need to compare the probabilities of these specific sequences occurring.

The sequence G B G B B G occurs with a probability of \((\frac{1}{2})^6 = \frac{1}{64}\), as each birth is an independent event with equal probability of being a boy or a girl.

Similarly, the sequence B G B B B B occurs with a probability of \((\frac{1}{2})^6 = \frac{1}{64}\) for the same reason.

Since both sequences are equally probable, the number of families in which B G B B B B occurs should be approximately the same as the number of families in which G B G B B G occurs.

Given that 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G,

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with sequence B G B B B B} = 45 \]

Therefore,

{answer: 45}
