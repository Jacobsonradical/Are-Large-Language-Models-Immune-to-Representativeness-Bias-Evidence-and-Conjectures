To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can look at the probability of each specific birth order occurring. 

For a family with 6 children, the total number of possible birth sequences is given by \(2^6 = 64\) since each child is either a boy (B) or a girl (G).

Given that the birth order G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, we can calculate the probability of this specific sequence as follows:

\[ P(G B G B B G) = \frac{\text{Number of families with G B G B B G}}{\text{Total number of families surveyed}} \]

We denote the total number of families surveyed by \( N \).

Hence,
\[ \frac{45}{N} = P(G B G B B G) \]

Next, we determine the probability of the specific sequence B G B B B B:

\[ P(B G B B B B) \]

Given all sequences are equally likely, the probability of any specific sequence of 6 births is the same.

Therefore,
\[ P(B G B B B B) = P(G B G B B G) \]

From the above equation:
\[ \frac{\text{Number of families with B G B B B B}}{N} = \frac{45}{N} \]

The expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would therefore be the same as the number for G B G B B G because the probabilities are equal:

Thus, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:
