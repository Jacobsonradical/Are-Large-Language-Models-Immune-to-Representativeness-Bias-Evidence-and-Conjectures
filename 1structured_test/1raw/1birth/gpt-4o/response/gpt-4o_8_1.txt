To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of a given sequence and compare it to the given sequence G B G B B G.

The total number of all possible sequences for 6 children (each being either a boy or a girl) is \(2^6 = 64\).

Each specific sequence (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) has the same probability of occurring, which is \( \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, and assuming that this probability holds uniformly for all sequences, we can use this information to estimate the number of families for any other specific sequence.

If G B G B B G corresponds to 45 families out of the survey, then the estimate for any other specific sequence, including B G B B B B, would also be 45 families.

Thus, the answer is:
