Each family has six children, and we are given that, in 45 families, the exact order of births was G B G B B G, which is one specific sequence out of all possible sequences of births.

The total number of possible sequences of births for six children can be calculated as \(2^6 = 64\), since each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G).

Assuming that each specific sequence of births is equally likely, the probability of any particular sequence occurring is \( \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Let's denote the total number of families surveyed by \(N\).

The expected number of families with the sequence G B G B B G is given by:
\[ \frac{1}{64} \times N = 45 \]

Solving for \(N\):
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Therefore, our estimate of the total number of families surveyed is 2880.

Now, we need to find the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B. Since this is also one specific sequence, the expected number of families with this sequence is:
\[ \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Hence, the answer is:
{answer: 45}
