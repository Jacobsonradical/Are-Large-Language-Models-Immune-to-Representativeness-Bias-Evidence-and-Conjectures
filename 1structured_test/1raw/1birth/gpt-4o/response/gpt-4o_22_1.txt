Sure. Here's how we can estimate the number of families surveyed with the exact birth order B G B B B B:

Each sequence of births is a series of independent events, assuming the probability of having a boy (B) or a girl (G) is equal, i.e., each with a probability of 0.5.

The probability of a specific sequence of 6 births is given by \( (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \). 

Given:
- There are 45 families with the exact order G B G B B G.

This sequence also has the same probability as any other specific sequence, such as B G B B B B.

Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. The number of families with the sequence G B G B B G is \( N \times \frac{1}{64} \).

Therefore:
\[ 45 = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

This is the estimated total number of families surveyed. Now, we need to find how many of these families had the specific order B G B B B B:

\[ \text{Number of families with order B G B B B B} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 45 \]

So, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is 45.
