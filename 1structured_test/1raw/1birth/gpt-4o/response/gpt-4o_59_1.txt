To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can utilize the concept of probability.

First, we recognize that each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), and the probability of each specific sequence of six children is \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\), given that each child is independent of the others.

Given: In 45 families, the exact order of births is G B G B B G.

This implies 45 families represent the occurrence of the sequence G B G B B G. According to the probability calculation, this sequence has a probability of 1/64.

To find the number of families, \(N\), we use the formula:
\[
45 = N \times \frac{1}{64}
\]

Solving for \(N\):
\[
N = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

This suggests that the total number of families surveyed is 2880. 

Now, we need to find the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B. The probability of obtaining the sequence B G B B B B is also \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Thus, the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B can be estimated as:
\[
N \times \frac{1}{64} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45
\]

Therefore, your estimate is:
\[
{answer: 45}
