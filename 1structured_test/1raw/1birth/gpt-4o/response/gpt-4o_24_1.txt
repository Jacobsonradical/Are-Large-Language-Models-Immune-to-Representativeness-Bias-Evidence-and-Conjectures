Let's analyze the probabilities. Each specific sequence of births for a family with six children (B or G) can be thought of as a sequence of 6 independent events, each with two outcomes (since the probability of being a boy or a girl is typically assumed to be approximately 0.5).

The sequence G B G B B G has 6 births and is a specific sequence that occurred in 45 families. Each specific sequence of 6 births has the same probability under the assumption of each being equally likely (0.5 for B or G each time).

Since there are \(2^6\) = 64 possible sequences of births (each birth having two outcomes: B or G), the general probability for any specific sequence of 6 children is:

\[ \text{Probability of any specific sequence} = \frac{1}{2^6} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Therefore, if 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G:
- This represents a specific sequence with a probability \(\frac{1}{64}\).
  
Hence, for every series (out of all possible sequences), it should appear in a proportion, allowing us to scale up consistently to find 45 families having the G B G B B G sequence.

So, if the occurrence of G B G B B G in 45 families remains a consistent basis under random study:

The same number of total families (\(N\)) would imply that an equal number for the sequence B G B B B B would follow the same probabilistic expectation: 

\[ \text{Expected number for any specific sequence} = \frac{1}{64} \times N \]

Given that we've seen the sequence \(G B G B B G\) emerge 45 times:

\[ 45 = \frac{1}{64} \times N \]

Then multiplying both sides of the equation by 64, we find:

\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]

\[ N = 2880 \]

Given populations represented overall and assuming homogeneity, the expected families of B G B B B B equals:

\[
{answer: 45}

Simply using the logic from having arbitrary equal sample probability equal scales of occurrence for a specific sequencing pattern in like terms.
