To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, let's first determine the probability of each specific order occurring.

Each child can be a boy (B) or a girl (G) with equal probability, so the probability of any specific order of 6 births is:

\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that in 45 families, the specific order G B G B B G was observed, we use this to estimate the total number of families surveyed (N).

Since the probability of any specific sequence is 1/64, we set up the proportion:

\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for N (total number of families surveyed):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Given that the probability of the specific order B G B B B B is the same as any other specific sequence, we can apply the same probability to get the expected number of families with this order:

\[ \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Thus, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
