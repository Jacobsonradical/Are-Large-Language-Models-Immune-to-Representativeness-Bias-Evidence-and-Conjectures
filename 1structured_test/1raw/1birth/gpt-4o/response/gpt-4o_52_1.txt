To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the number of possible birth orders for a family with six children and the probability of a specific birth order.

First, let's examine the probability of any specific birth order. Each child's birth can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), with 2 possibilities per child. For six children, there are a total of \(2^6 = 64\) possible birth orders.

Given that in 45 families, the exact birth order was G B G B B G, we assume that every specific birth order has an equal probability of occurring. Hence, if 45 families out of the total surveyed had the birth order G B G B B G, we can use this to find the total number of families surveyed.

The probability of any specific birth order, like G B G B B G or B G B B B B, is \(\frac{1}{64}\). Therefore, the number of families surveyed can be estimated as follows:
\[ \text{Total families surveyed} = 45 \times 64 \]

Now, we want to know the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B. Since the probability for this specific order is also \(\frac{1}{64}\), we use the estimated total number of families surveyed:

\[ \text{Number of families with order B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \times \text{Total families surveyed} \]

Substituting the total families surveyed:
\[ \text{Number of families with order B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \times (45 \times 64) = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
