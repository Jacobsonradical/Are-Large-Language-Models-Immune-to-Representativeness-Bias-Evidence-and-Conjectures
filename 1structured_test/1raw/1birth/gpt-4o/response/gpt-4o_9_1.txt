To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to first understand the probability of a specific birth sequence occurring. 

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (each being 0.5), the probability of any specific sequence of 6 births (such as G B G B B G) is:

\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that the sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families, we can set up a proportion to estimate the total number of families surveyed:

\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \( N \) (the total number of families surveyed):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Now, we need to find how many families would have the sequence B G B B B B. The probability of this sequence occurring is also \( \frac{1}{64} \).

Using the total number of families surveyed:

\[ \text{Number of families with the sequence B G B B B B} = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 45 \]

So, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

\[ \{ \text{answer: 45} \} \]
