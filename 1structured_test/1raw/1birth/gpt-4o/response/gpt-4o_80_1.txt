To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to compare the probability of this specific birth order with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assuming that each child is equally likely to be a boy (B) or a girl (G), the probability of any specific birth order of six children is \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\).

Given that 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, which also has a probability of \(1/64\), we can estimate the total number of families surveyed (\(N\)).

Since 45 families represent the number of occurrences of a birth order with a probability of \(1/64\):
\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \(N\), we get:
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Therefore, there are 2880 families surveyed.

Now, to find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, which also has a probability of \(1/64\):
\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B } = \frac{2880}{64} \]
\[ = 45 \]

So, the estimate is:
