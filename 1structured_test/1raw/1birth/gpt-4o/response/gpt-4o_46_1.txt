To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G.

Firstly, we should understand the probability of each specific sequence occurring. Given there are no biases or other influencing factors, the probability of each gender being born is \( \frac{1}{2} \), and each child's birth is independent of the others'.

For a sequence of six births, the probability of a specific sequence occurring is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that 45 families had the exact sequence G B G B B G, we can deduce that this sequence has a probability of occurrence of \( \frac{1}{64} \).

To find the total number of families surveyed, \( N \):

\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \implies N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

So, our estimate of the total number of families surveyed is 2880.

Now, we need to estimate how many of these 2880 families had the birth sequence B G B B B B. Since the probability of this specific sequence is also \( \frac{1}{64} \):

\[ \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
