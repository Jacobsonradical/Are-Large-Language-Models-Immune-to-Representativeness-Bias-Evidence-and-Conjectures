To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to understand the likelihood of each specific birth order sequence occurring given that all birth orders are equally probable.

There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of births (as each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), and there are 6 children).

We know that in 45 families, the exact birth order was G B G B B G.

If all sequences are equally likely, the same number of families should exist for each specific sequence.

Therefore, if 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, the same number of families should have the sequence B G B B B B.

Hence, our estimate is:
