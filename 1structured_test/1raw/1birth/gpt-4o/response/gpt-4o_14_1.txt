The probability of any specific sequence of births is the same, assuming each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl (each with a probability of 0.5). Since there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this to estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B.

Both sequences have the same probability of occurring, which is \( (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Therefore, the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should be approximately the same as the number with the sequence G B G B B G.

Hence, the estimate is 45.
