In the given problem, we need to estimate the number of families where the exact birth order of children is B G B B B B, given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G. 

To solve this, we should recognize the number of ways each birth order can occur for a family with six children. Each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), and we have a total of 64 (2^6) possible combinations for the birth orders.

The probability of any specific sequence of boys and girls happening in each family is the same for any specific sequence. Thus, every sequence of births (such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B) should conceptually be equally likely in a large enough sample. 

Given that 45 families experienced the G B G B B G sequence, and noting that this is just one out of the 64 possible sequences, we can infer the ratio of these sequences to the total number can be used to estimate others.

Calculating with this logic:
\[
\text{Number of families with G B G B B G} = 45
\]
\[
\text{Total possible sequences} = 64
\]

\[
\text{Estimate for families with B G B B B B sequence} = \frac{1}{64} \times \text{Total number of families surveyed}
\]

Since we are given that 45 families out of the total surveyed have the G B G B B G sequence:
\[
\text{Total number of families surveyed} = 45 \times 64
\]

\[
\text{Total number of families surveyed} = 2880
\]

Now, we will find the estimate for B G B B B B likewise:
\[
\text{Estimate for B G B B B B sequence} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45
\]

Therefore, the number of families where the exact birth order is B G B B B B is also 45 since all possible sequences are equally likely in a large enough sample.
