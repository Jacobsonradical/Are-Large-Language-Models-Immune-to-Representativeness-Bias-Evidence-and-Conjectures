To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the information provided about the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

First, we need to understand the probability of each specific birth order occurring. Each child has a probability of 1/2 of being a boy or a girl, independently of the others.

Let's calculate the probability of the birth order G B G B B G:

- P(G B G B B G): (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Given that 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of families surveyed (let this number be N):

(45 families) / (1/64) = N

N = 45 * 64 = 2880 families.

Now, we estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B:

- P(B G B B B B): (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Thus, the expected number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

N * (1/64) = 2880 * 1/64 = 45 families.

So, our estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
