To calculate the estimated number of families in which the exact order of births is B G B B B B, we need to determine the probability of each specific sequence of births and use it to make an appropriate estimate.

For a family of six children, the probability of any specific birth sequence (assuming boys and girls are equally likely, and each child is born independently of the others) is given by \( (1/2)^6 \).

Both the sequence G B G B B G and the sequence B G B B B B have the same probability of occurring, which is:

\[ (1/2)^6 = 1/64. \]

If 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, we can use that to find the total number of families surveyed. Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. Given that 45 families represent the sequence G B G B B G, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64}. \]

Solving for \( N \):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880. \]

Now, we estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. Knowing that the probability of this exact sequence occurring is also \( 1/64 \) and there are \( 2880 \) families:

\[ \frac{2880}{64} = 45. \]

Hence, the estimated number of families in which the exact order of births is B G B B B B is 45.
