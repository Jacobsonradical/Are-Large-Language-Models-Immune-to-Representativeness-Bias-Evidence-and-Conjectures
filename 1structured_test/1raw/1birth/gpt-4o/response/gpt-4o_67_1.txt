To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of any specific order of births occurring.

For a family with six children, there are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of births, assuming each child is equally likely to be a boy (B) or a girl (G).

Given:
- The sequence G B G B B G was observed in 45 families.

The probability of any specific sequence (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) occurring is the same and equals \(\frac{1}{64}\).

To estimate the number of families surveyed (N), we use the fact that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G.
\[ \text{Probability of G B G B B G} = \frac{1}{64} \]

The expected number of families with the specific sequence G B G B B G among N families is:
\[ \frac{N}{64} = 45 \]

Solving for N:
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Thus, the total number of families surveyed is estimated to be 2880.

Now, to find the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B:
\[ \text{Probability of B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \]

The expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B among N families is:
\[ \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:
{answer: 45}
