A common approach to solving this problem is to assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, which is 50% or \( \frac{1}{2} \). The sequence G B G B B G specifies a particular order of genders, which also applies to the sequence B G B B B B.

First, let's calculate the probability of having the sequence G B G B B G. Since each child is either a boy or a girl with equal probability, the probability for this specific sequence is:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Similarly, the probability of the sequence B G B B B B is:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that the survey involved enough families such that these probabilities hold true on average. To estimate the total number of families surveyed, we use the frequency of the sequence G B G B B G:

\[ 45 \text{ families} = \left(\frac{1}{64}\right) \times \text{Total families surveyed} \]

So, the total number of families surveyed is:
\[ \text{Total families surveyed} = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, with the number of families surveyed determined, we can estimate the number of families that have the sequence B G B B B B, which is expected to be the same proportion of the total number of families:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with B G B B B B} = \left(\frac{1}{64}\right) \times 2880 = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate is:
\[ \{answer: 45\} \]
