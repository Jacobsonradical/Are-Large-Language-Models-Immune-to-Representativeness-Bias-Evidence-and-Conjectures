To solve this, we first note that the order of births can vary, and each child being a boy or a girl is typically assumed to be an independent event with equal probability (50% each).

The specific sequence "G B G B B G" represents an exact order for births where there are 3 boys and 3 girls. The probability of this specific sequence occurring can be derived from the number of permutations or arrangements of 3 boys (B) and 3 girls (G) over 6 positions, but since we are looking for a specific sequence, the probability is directly \((1/2)^6\).

Similarly, the sequence "B G B B B B" represents an exact order for births where there are 5 boys and 1 girl. The probability of this specific sequence occurring is also \((1/2)^6\).

Given that 45 families experienced the "G B G B B G" sequence, we can say:
\[ \text{Probability of observing "G B G B B G"} = (1/2)^6 \]

Since both sequences have the same probability of occurring, the number of families that experienced each sequence should be proportional given a large sample size. Therefore, if 45 families experienced "G B G B B G", we would expect the same number of families to experience "B G B B B B".

Hence:
{answer: 45}
