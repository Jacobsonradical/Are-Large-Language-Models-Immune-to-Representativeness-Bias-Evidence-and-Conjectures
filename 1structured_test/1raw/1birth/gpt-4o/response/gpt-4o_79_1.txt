To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we first need to acknowledge that the probability of any specific sequence of 6 births (assuming boys and girls are equally likely, i.e., each has a probability of 1/2) is the same.

For any specific sequence of 6 births, the probability is:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that there are 45 families with the exact sequence G B G B B G, we assume that the likelihood of any specific sequence of 6 births occurring is proportional to the surveyed total. Thus, 45 families represent 1/64 of the families surveyed.

We can then calculate the total number of families surveyed \((n)\) using:
\[ \frac{n}{64} = 45 \]
\[ n = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ n = 2880 \]

Now, we need to estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B. Given that this sequence should occur with the same probability as any other specific sequence, the expected number of families with this specific sequence is:
\[ \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

So, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
