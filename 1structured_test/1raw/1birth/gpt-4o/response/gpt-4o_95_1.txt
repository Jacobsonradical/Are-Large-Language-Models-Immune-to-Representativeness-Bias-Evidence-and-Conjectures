To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can utilize the total number of possible birth orders. Each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, making it a Bernoulli process.

The sequence G B G B B G is one specific permutation out of the \(2^6 = 64\) possible birth orders for six children. Given that this permutation appears in 45 families, we assume this is representative.

Thus, the sequence B G B B B B also has a probability \( \frac{1}{64} \).

If 45 families correspond to one specific sequence (G B G B B G), then:

\[ \text{Total number of families surveyed} = 45 \times 64 \]

Next, calculating the number of families for the sequence B G B B B B (which is also one specific sequence):

\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = 45 \]

So the final estimate is:
