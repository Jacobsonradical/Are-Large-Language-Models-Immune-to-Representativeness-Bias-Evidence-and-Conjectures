To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the ratio of the two specific birth orders provided.

The probability of any specific sequence of six children (with any given sequence of boys and girls) occurring in a family is \( (1/2)^6 = 1/64 \), since each child being a boy or a girl is an independent event with probability 1/2.

Given that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, we can assume that the number of families surveyed is proportional for other sequences. 

The probability of the sequence G B G B B G occurring in a family is the same as any other specific sequence, which is also 1/64.

Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. If 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, then the fraction of families with this exact sequence is \( 45/N \). Since this fraction should be equal to the probability of that specific sequence (1/64), we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \( N \):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

So, the total number of families surveyed is 2880. 

Now, we can use this total to estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, which also has a probability of 1/64:

\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Thus, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.
