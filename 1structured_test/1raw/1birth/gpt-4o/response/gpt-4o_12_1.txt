To answer this question, we will assume that each sequence of boys and girls is equally likely, which means each specific order has an equal chance of occurring. In a family with six children, there are \(2^6 = 64\) different possible birth sequences, since each child can be either a boy or a girl.

We know that in 45 families, the specific sequence G B G B B G occurred. The sequence G B G B B G is just one of the 64 possible sequences.

For the sequence B G B B B B, which is another specific sequence, it is equally likely to occur just as the G B G B B G sequence. Thus, if we find that 45 families had the G B G B B G sequence, we can expect about the same number of families to have the B G B B B B sequence. 

Therefore, my estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
