To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distribution of orders of births. Given a specific birth order, each combination of boys (B) and girls (G) is equally likely if we assume that the probability of having a boy or girl is the same (50%).

The probability of a specific order of B's and G's happening is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{6} = \frac{1}{64} \).

From the problem, we know that 45 families have the exact birth order G B G B B G. We need to find the number of families that have the order B G B B B B.

Since both sequences (G B G B B G and B G B B B B) consist of 6 children and are specific sequences of birth events, the likelihood of any specific sequence occurring is the same.

If 45 families out of the total surveyed have the sequence G B G B B G, then the proportion of families with any specific sequence should be the same. Therefore, 45 families should also have the sequence B G B B B B.

Hence, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
