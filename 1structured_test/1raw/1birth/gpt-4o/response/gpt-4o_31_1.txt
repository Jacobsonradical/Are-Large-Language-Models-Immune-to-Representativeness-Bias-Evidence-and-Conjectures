To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to determine the likelihood of this specific sequence compared to the sequence G B G B B G. 

Assuming each child born is equally likely to be a boy or a girl (with probability 0.5 for each), the probability of any given sequence of six births occurring in that exact order is \( (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can deduce that the total number of families surveyed can be estimated. The probability of G B G B B G is the same as any other specific sequence of six births, such as B G B B B B.

Therefore, if 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by recognizing that each specific sequence has the same probability.

The proportion of families with the sequence B G B B B B should be equivalent to the proportion with G B G B B G among the total surveyed families, leading us to expect roughly the same number of families.

Thus, the estimated number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
