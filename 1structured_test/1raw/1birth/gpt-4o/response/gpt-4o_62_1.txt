Consider the given birth sequence G B G B B G. The total number of children is six, and the sequence has 3 boys and 3 girls. To determine the probability of this exact sequence occurring, we start by calculating the total number of combinations of 3 boys and 3 girls in any sequence:

\[ \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20 \]

Since each of these 20 combinations is equally likely, the probability of any specific sequence with 3 boys and 3 girls is:

\[ P(\text{G B G B B G}) = \frac{1}{20} \]

Given this sequence appeared in 45 families, we can use this probability to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Let \( N \) represent the total number of surveyed families. We can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{20} \times N = 45 \]

Solving for \( N \):

\[ N = 45 \times 20 = 900 \]

Now, we calculate the probability of the sequence B G B B B B occurring. This sequence has 5 boys and 1 girl. The number of combinations where this specific sequence occurs is:

\[ \binom{6}{1} = 6 \]

Therefore, the probability is:

\[ P(\text{B G B B B B}) = \frac{1}{6} \]

Finally, using the total estimated number of families \( N = 900 \), we estimate the number of families with the exact sequence B G B B B B:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 900 = 150 \]

Thus, the estimate of the number of families surveyed where the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
{answer: 150}
