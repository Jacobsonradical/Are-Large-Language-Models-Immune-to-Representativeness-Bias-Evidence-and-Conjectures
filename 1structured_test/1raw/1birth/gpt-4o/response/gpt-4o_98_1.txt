To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the relative likelihood of different birth sequences assuming each child is independently likely to be a boy or girl with equal probability (i.e., 50%).

For a sequence of births of six children:

- The probability of any specific sequence occurring is \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\), since each child being a boy or girl is an independent event with a probability of \(1/2\).

Given that the sequence G B G B B G was observed in 45 families:

1. The probability of the sequence G B G B B G is \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\).

2. Similarly, the probability of the sequence B G B B B B is also \(1/64\).

Assuming that the number of families surveyed is large enough for these probabilistic estimates to hold, if 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can expect the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B to be approximately equal.

Thus, the estimate for the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is also 45.
