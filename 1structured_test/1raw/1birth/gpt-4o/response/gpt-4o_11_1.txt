To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the probability of a specific sequence of six children.

Each child being either a boy (B) or a girl (G) is assumed to be equally likely, so the probability of any specific sequence of six children is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that there were 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this to find the total number of families surveyed:

If \( P(\text{G B G B B G}) = \frac{1}{64} \) and there are 45 families with this sequence, then:

Total families surveyed \( = 45 \times 64 \).

Now, to find the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same probability:

Number of families with B G B B B B \( = \left(\frac{1}{64}\right) \times (45 \times 64) = 45 \).

Thus, our estimate is:
