To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the given information that 45 families have the order G B G B B G.

Each specific sequence of births is equally likely, assuming boys and girls are equally likely to be born. The probability of any specific sequence of births occurring, if we treat the births as independent events with equal likelihood of being a boy or a girl, is \( \frac{1}{2^6} = \frac{1}{64} \).

If 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, we can use the same probability to estimate the number of families for the sequence B G B B B B.

Given:
- Number of families with sequence G B G B B G = 45

Same probability implies a similar expected number for another specific sequence:
- Therefore, estimated number of families with sequence B G B B B B = 45

Thus, the answer is:
{answer: 45}
