To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of a specific birth order occurring in the context of all possible birth orders.

Let's assume that the probability of having a girl (G) or a boy (B) on any given birth is equal and independent of each other, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \) for each.

The birth sequence G B G B B G has 3 boys and 3 girls. The number of ways to arrange 3 boys (B) and 3 girls (G) in a sequence is given by the binomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

This means there are 20 equally likely sequences of 3 boys and 3 girls.

The survey found 45 families with the specific sequence G B G B B G. Using this, we can find the total number of families who have exactly 3 boys and 3 girls by proportion:

\[ \frac{1}{20} \text{ of all 3B, 3G families} = 45 \text{ families} \]

So the total number of 3B, 3G families is:

\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \]

Now, consider the sequence B G B B B B, which comprises 5 boys and 1 girl. The number of ways to arrange 5 boys and 1 girl is:

\[ \binom{6}{1} = 6 \]

To find the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we first need to determine the proportion of families with 5 boys and 1 girl. Given what we know, the frequency of a specific sequence (here, G B G B B G) is consistent with all families. Therefore, we'll assume there is a similar survey result for every possible combination of 5 boys and 1 girl.

If we use the same principle as above, i.e., one of the 6 possible sequences for exactly 5 boys and 1 girl is chosen 1/6th of the time, the same proportion works here:

\[ 6 \text{ sequences for 5B, 1G family} = \text{x} \text{(total number of such families)} / 6 \]

Using the known data:

\[ \frac{1}{20} \text{ of all 3B, 3G families} = 45 \]

But

\[ \frac{1}{6} \text{ of all 5B, 1G families} \approx \text{y families (like 45)} \]

This could imply roughly a similar number if the results were scaled equivalently (without changing):

So the final estimate of the number of families where the sequence is B G B B B B follows logically the same fixed pattern: 

\[  \boxed{ 45 } \]

So, the expected number of families having the sequence B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
