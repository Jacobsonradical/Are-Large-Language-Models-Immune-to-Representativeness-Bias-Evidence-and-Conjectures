To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can make use of the assumption that each birth is independent and the probability of having a boy or girl is equal (i.e., 0.5 for each).

The number of families with the exact order G B G B B G is given as 45. First, we calculate the probability of this specific order occurring. The required order is G B G B B G:

\[
P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the probability of the specific order B G B B B B:

\[
P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Given that the probability of both specific orders is the same, and assuming the total number of families surveyed is sufficiently large such that these probabilities hold true, the number of families with the order B G B B B B should also be the same as those with the order G B G B B G.

Thus, the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is estimated to be:

\[
\{answer: 45\}
