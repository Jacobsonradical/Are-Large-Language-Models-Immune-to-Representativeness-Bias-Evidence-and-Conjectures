To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to assume that each possible sequence of births is equally likely.

Given that there are exactly 45 families with the order G B G B B G, let's calculate the probability of this specific order. Each child being a boy or a girl is independent, and each specific sequence of 6 births has a probability of \((1/2)^6 = 1/64\).

Since 45 families are observed with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by recognizing that one sequence has a probability of 1/64, and multiply the observed number of families by 64:

\[ \text{Total number of families} = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, we consider the sequence B G B B B B. The probability of this specific sequence occurring is also \(1/64\).

Given the total estimated number of families surveyed is 2880, we can now estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B as follows:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

So, based on the provided information and the assumption that each specific sequence is equally likely, the estimate is:
