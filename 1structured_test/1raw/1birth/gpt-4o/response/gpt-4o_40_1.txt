The survey records the exact order of births in families of six children. In a sequence of exactly six births, each order is equally likely. There are \( 2^6 = 64 \) possible birth sequences (since each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), and \( 2^6 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \)).

We know that 45 families had the order G B G B B G.

First, we denote the probability of any particular sequence occurring. Since there are 64 possible sequences, the probability for any specific sequence is:

\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that 45 families had the specific order G B G B B G, we can infer that the total number of families surveyed is \( N \), where:

\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]

To find \( N \):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Thus, there were 2880 families surveyed.

Now, we estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B. Since each specific sequence is equally probable, we use the same probability. Therefore, the expected number of families with this specific sequence is:

\[ \text{Expected number of families} = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 \]

So:

\[ \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]
