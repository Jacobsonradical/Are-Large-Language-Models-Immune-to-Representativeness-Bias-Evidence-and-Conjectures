We know that the order of births for boys (B) and girls (G) in a family of six children is a sequence of length 6. The sequence provided is G B G B B G. To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births is B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of each specific sequence occurring.

Given that we are dealing with a sequence of six births, the total number of possible sequences of boys and girls is \(2^6 = 64\). Each possible sequence of six births is equally likely, so the probability of any specific sequence occurring is \( \frac{1}{64} \).

In the survey, 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G. This means we can use these data to predict the number of families that would have any specific sequence.

Given that each sequence is equally likely, the number of families with any specific sequence can be estimated similarly. Therefore, if 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate:
\[ \text{Estimated number of families with sequence B G B B B B} = 45 \]

So, my estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
{answer: 45}
