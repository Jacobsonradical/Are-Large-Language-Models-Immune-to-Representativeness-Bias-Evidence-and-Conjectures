To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the ratio of the favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes for any specific sequence of six births.

Each child can either be a boy (B) or a girl (G), making the probability of any specific sequence of six births as \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 \).

There are 64 (i.e., \(2^6\)) possible sequences of births.

For the sequence G B G B B G, it has been reported that this sequence occurred in 45 families. Let's denote the total number of families surveyed as \( N \).

Since the probability of any particular sequence occurring is \( \frac{1}{64} \), we can write the following relationship based on the survey finding:

\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \( N \):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

So, the total number of families surveyed is estimated to be 2880.

Now, to find the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the same probability \(\frac{1}{64}\):

\[ \text{Number of families with the exact order B G B B B B} = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 45 \]

Thus, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
