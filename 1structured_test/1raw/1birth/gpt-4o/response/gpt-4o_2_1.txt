To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distribution of birth orders in families of six children. Each birth has two possible outcomes: a boy (B) or a girl (G). Therefore, the probability of a specific order of six children, like G B G B B G, is:

\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that 45 families had the exact order G B G B B G, this suggests that:

\[ \text{Number of families with order G B G B B G} = 45 \]

Since the probability of any specific birth order of six children is \( \frac{1}{64} \), the total number of families surveyed (let's call that number \( N \)) would be:

\[ \frac{45}{\frac{1}{64}} = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

This means approximately 2880 families were surveyed.

To find the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, the same probability applies:

\[ \text{Probability of B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Thus, the estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B is:

\[ \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Therefore, the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is estimated to be:

{answer: 45}
