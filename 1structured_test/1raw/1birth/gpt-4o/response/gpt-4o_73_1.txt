Recall that each child in a family has an equal probability of being either a boy or a girl. Hence, each specific birth order sequence out of six births has a probability of \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that the sequence "G B G B B G" was observed in 45 families, the same probability distribution applies to all sequences of six births.

Therefore, the expected number of families with the birth order "B G B B B B" would also be:

\[ 45 \text{ families} \]

Thus, the estimate is:
{answer: 45}
