To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the total number of possible birth orders for six children and use this to scale the given data.

There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible birth orders for six children (each birth can be either a boy or a girl, and there are six births). 

Given that the exact birth order G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, this represents 1 out of the 64 possible equally likely birth orders.

Therefore, if 45 families out of the total surveyed had the birth order G B G B B G, we would expect the same for any other specific order (assuming each order is equally likely).

So, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B should also be 45.

Thus,

{answer: 45}
