To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the binomial probability model. This model assumes that the probability of a child being a boy or a girl is independent from one birth to the next and that each birth has a probability of 0.5 for being a boy or a girl.

The exact birth order of Boys (B) and Girls (G) in six children is a specific sequence. The probability \( P \) of any one specific sequence of six children (where each child can be either a B or a G) is given by:
\[ P = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can derive the total number of families surveyed \( N \) as follows:
\[ 45 = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

This suggests that approximately 2880 families were surveyed.

Now, for the sequence B G B B B B:
\[ \text{Number of families} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ \text{Number of families} = 45 \]

So, the estimated number of families surveyed with the exact order B G B B B B is:
{answer: 45}
