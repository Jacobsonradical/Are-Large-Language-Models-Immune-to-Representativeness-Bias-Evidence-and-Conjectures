To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of each specific birth order occurring randomly.

In a family of six children, the probability of any particular sequence of genders (boys and girls) is \( (\frac{1}{2})^6 = \frac{1}{64} \) because each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl and each child's gender is independent.

Given that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, this sequence is also one specific arrangement out of the 64 possible sequences.

Therefore, the expected number of families with any specific sequence should be the same.

If there are \( N \) families in total, the probability of any specific sequence (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) happening in one family is \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Hence, for the sequence G B G B B G which appeared in 45 families, we calculate the total number of surveyed families \( N \) as follows:
\[ 45 = N \cdot \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \( N \),
\[ N = 45 \cdot 64 = 2880 \]

Thus, the estimated number of families where the specific sequence B G B B B B occurs would be:
\[ \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

So, our estimate is:
