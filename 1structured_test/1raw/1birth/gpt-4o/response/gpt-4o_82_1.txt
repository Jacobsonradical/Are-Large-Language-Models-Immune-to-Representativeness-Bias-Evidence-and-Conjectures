To estimate the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we'll use the probability of each specific birth sequence occurring.

The probability of any specific order of births (e.g., G B G B B G) in a family of six children, assuming the probability of having a boy or girl is equal (each being 0.5), is:
\[ P = (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can set up the proportion as follows:
\[ \text{Number of families with G B G B B G} = 45 \]

We want to find the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B.

Since the probability of both sequences occurring is the same, the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should also be proportional.

Let \( x \) be the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B:
\[ \text{P(specific sequence)} = \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ \text{Total number of families surveyed} = 45 \times 64 \]

Since 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, there should be an equal number of families with any other specific sequence:
\[ x = \frac{45 \times 64}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
