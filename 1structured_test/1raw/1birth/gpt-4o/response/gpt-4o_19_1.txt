To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the assumption that each sequence is equally likely.

Given that there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we need to calculate the probability of this sequence and assume proportionality.

The total number of possible sequences of 6 children (each being either a boy (B) or a girl (G)) is \(2^6 = 64\).

The specific sequence G B G B B G is one particular sequence out of these 64, so its probability is \( \frac{1}{64} \).

Similarly, the sequence B G B B B B is another specific sequence and its probability is also \( \frac{1}{64} \).

Since 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B using the same probability.

The equation to estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be:
\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = 45 \]

Therefore, my estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
{answer: 45}
