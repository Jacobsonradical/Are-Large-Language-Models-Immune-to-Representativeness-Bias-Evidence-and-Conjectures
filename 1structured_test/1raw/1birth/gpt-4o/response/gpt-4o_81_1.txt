To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider the probability of this specific sequence occurring, assuming each child is equally likely to be a boy (B) or a girl (G).

Each of the six birth slots can be either B or G. The total number of possible sequences of births for six children is \(2^6 = 64\).

Given that in 45 families the sequence was G B G B B G, we can determine the likelihood of any specific sequence occurring versus another. The probability of any one specific sequence occurring is \( \frac{1}{64} \).

Since 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, it follows that:
\[ 45 = \text{Total number of families surveyed} \times \frac{1}{64} \]

Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. Then:
\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \( N \):
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Thus, the estimated number of families surveyed is 2880.

Now, to find the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same principle:
\[ \text{Number of families with sequence B G B B B B} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ = 45 \]

Therefore, the answer is:
