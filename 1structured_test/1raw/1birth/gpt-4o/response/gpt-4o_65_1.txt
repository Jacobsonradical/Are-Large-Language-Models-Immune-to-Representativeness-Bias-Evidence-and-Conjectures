To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, let's consider the probability of each specific birth order.

The probability of a child being born as either a boy (B) or a girl (G) is generally assumed to be 0.5, assuming an equal probability for either gender. 

For the given birth order G B G B B G, the probability is:
\[ P(G B G B B G) = (0.5)^6 = 0.5^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that this specific order (G B G B B G) was found in 45 families, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. Let's denote the total number of families surveyed by \( N \).

If \( \frac{N}{64} = 45 \), solving for \( N \) we get:
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, we need to find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. The probability of this specific birth order is also:
\[ P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 0.5^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

So, the expected number of families with this birth order (B G B B B B) out of the total surveyed families (2880) is:
\[ \frac{N}{64} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
