To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we start by considering the total number of possible birth orders for six children.

The number of different ways to arrange six children, regardless of gender, is \(2^6 = 64\).

Now, we know that there are 45 families with the specific order G B G B B G.

The occurrence of any specific sequence of births out of the 64 possible birth orders should be roughly equal if every sequence is equally likely. Therefore, the fraction of families with the order G B G B B G should be \( \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that such a specific order occurs in 45 families, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed.

Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed.

The expected count of any specific sequence (like G B G B B G) in the surveyed families is \( \frac{N}{64} \).

So, according to the survey: 
\[ \frac{N}{64} = 45 \]

To find \( N \), we multiply both sides by 64:
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Now, we apply the same logic to estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B.

Since each specific sequence should occur with equal probability, we expect:
\[ \frac{N}{64} \]

Using \( N = 2880 \):
\[ \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate for the number of families with the exact birth order B G B B B B is:
