To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we first need to understand that the birth orders of boys (B) and girls (G) are considered equally likely and independent.

In any given family with six children, each specific sequence of births (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) has the same probability of occurring. Since there are 2 possible outcomes (B or G) for each birth, the total number of unique sequences of births for 6 children is \(2^6 = 64\).

Given that 45 families had the specific sequence G B G B B G, we assume that the surveyed families are representative and that each sequence is equally likely.

Using this information, we can estimate the number of families surveyed (let's call this number \(N\)). For any specific sequence, including G B G B B G or B G B B B B, the expected number of families having that sequence should be proportional to the total number of families surveyed:
\[
\frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Solving for \(N\):
\[
N = 45 \times 64
\]
\[
N = 2880
\]

Therefore, among these \(2880\) families, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should be:
\[
\frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45
\]

Thus, the estimated number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.

Therefore, the answer is:
{answer: 45}
