To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the given information about the specific pattern G B G B B G appearing in 45 families. 

First, we need to recognize that each sequence of six births is equally likely. The probability of any specific sequence (such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B) happening is the same, assuming each birth is independent and boys and girls are equally likely.

There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of six births (since each birth can result in either a boy or a girl). 

Given that 45 families experienced one specific sequence (G B G B B G), we can use this to estimate the total number of surveyed families. Since each sequence has an equal probability of occurring:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ families}}{1 \text{ specific sequence}} = \frac{Total \text{ families surveyed}}{64 \text{ possible sequences}} \]

Let's denote the total number of families surveyed by \(X\):

\[ \frac{45}{1} = \frac{X}{64} \]

Solving for \(X\):

\[ X = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

So, the estimated number of families surveyed is 2880.

Since there are 64 possible sequences and each is equally likely, the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B is expected to be:

\[ \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

Thus, the estimate is:
