First, we need to understand that each birth sequence is an independent event. Therefore, the probability of any specific sequence of boys (B) and girls (G) occurring in a family of six children is equal.

Each child can either be a boy (B) or a girl (G), giving us a total number of \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences for the birth order in a family with six children.

Since each sequence is equally likely, the probability of any specific sequence occurring is \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Given that 45 families had the sequence "G B G B B G," we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed:
- Probability of "G B G B B G" occurring in any family is \(\frac{1}{64}\).
- If 45 families had that sequence, we can set up the proportion:

  \[
  \frac{45}{\text{Total number of families}} = \frac{1}{64}
  \]

Solving for the total number of families:

  \[
  \text{Total number of families} = 45 \times 64 = 2880
  \]

Now, we estimate the number of families that had the sequence "B G B B B B":
- Probability of "B G B B B B" occurring in any family is also \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Therefore, the expected number of families with the sequence "B G B B B B" is:

  \[
  \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45
  \]

Thus, our estimate for the number of families in which the exact order of births was "B G B B B B" is:
