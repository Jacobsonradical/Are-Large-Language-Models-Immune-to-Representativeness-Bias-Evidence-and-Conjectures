Let's first understand the ratio of the two specific birth orders given:

1. G B G B B G
2. B G B B B B

Each birth order sequence is one of the possible outcomes when considering the birth of six children. There are a total of \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of births (since each child can be either a boy or a girl).

To find the number of families that had the sequence G B G B B G out of the total surveyed, we can denote the number of families with this sequence as \(N_{GBGBBG} = 45\).

Since each specific sequence is equally likely, we can use the ratio of the given sequences to estimate the total number of families sampled.

If \(N\) is the total number of families surveyed, the probability of observing any specific sequence (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Given that 45 families had the G B G B B G sequence, the fraction of these families is:
\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \(N\):
\[ 45 = \frac{N}{64} \implies N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Therefore, the approximate number of families surveyed is 2880. 

Using this, we can now estimate the number of families with the B G B B B B sequence:
Since the probability of any specific sequence is the same, the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B should also be:
\[ \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Thus, the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is also:
{answer: 45}
