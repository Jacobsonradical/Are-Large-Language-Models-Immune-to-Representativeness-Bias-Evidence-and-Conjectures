To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can make an assumption that each birth order is equally likely. 

Given:
- There are 6 children in each family.
- The specific birth order G B G B B G was found in 45 families.
- The probability of any specific birth order occurring is 1/2 for each child (either boy or girl).

The total number of possible birth orders for 6 children is:
\[ 2^6 = 64 \]

If we assume each possible birth order is equally likely, then each specific birth order should have the same frequency.

Given that G B G B B G showed up 45 times, this should be proportional to the number of families. Thus, the probability of a specific birth order like B G B B B B occurring is the same as the probability of G B G B B G occurring, if the total number of families surveyed is the same.

Hence, our estimate of the number of families in which the birth order is B G B B B B should be the same as for G B G B B G.

So, the estimate is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]
