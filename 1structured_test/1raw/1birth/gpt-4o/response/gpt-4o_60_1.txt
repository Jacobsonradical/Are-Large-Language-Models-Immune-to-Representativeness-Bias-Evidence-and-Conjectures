To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we will assume that the births of boys and girls are equally likely, i.e., each child has a 50% chance of being a boy (B) or a girl (G).

Given the order of G B G B B G for 45 families, we first need to find the probability of this specific sequence occurring. Since each child is independently either a boy or a girl with equal probability, the probability of any specific sequence of six births is:

\[ (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Since there are 45 families with the G B G B B G sequence, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by considering the inverse of this probability:

\[ \text{Total number of families} \approx 45 \times 64 \]

\[ \text{Total number of families} \approx 2880 \]

Now, to find the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B, we use the same probability calculation:

\[ \text{Probability of B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \]

With the total estimated number of families being 2880, the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B can be calculated as:

\[ 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
