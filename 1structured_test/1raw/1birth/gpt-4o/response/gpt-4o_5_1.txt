To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can consider the probability of each specific sequence of births occurring. For simplicty, let's assume the probability of a boy (B) or a girl (G) being born is equal (0.5 each). 

The probability of any specific sequence with 6 births (like G B G B B G) is:
\[ (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can set up a proportion to estimate the total number of families surveyed. If 45 families represent the number of occurrences of a sequence that has \(\frac{1}{64}\) probability, we can use this relationship to find the total:

Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed:
\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Now, to find the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we use the same probability approach:

\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = 45 \]

Hence, the estimated number of families with the exact order B G B B B B is:
