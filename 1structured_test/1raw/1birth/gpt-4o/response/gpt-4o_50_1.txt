To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the idea of the probability of each specific birth order assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal and independent. 

Consider that each birth (either boy or girl) is independent and has a probability of 1/2. The probability of one specific sequence of births (e.g., G B G B B G) is:
\( P(\text{one specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \)

Similarly, the probability of having the specific sequence B G B B B B is also:
\( P(B G B B B B) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \)

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can use the proportionality based on probabilities:

Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed.
The number of families with the sequence G B G B B G is 45:

\[  \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]
Solving for \( N \):
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Thus, if there are 2880 families in total, the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be:

\[ 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
