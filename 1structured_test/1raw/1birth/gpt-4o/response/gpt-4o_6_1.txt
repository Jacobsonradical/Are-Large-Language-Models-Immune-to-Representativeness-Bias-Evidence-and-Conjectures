To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we need to consider that each specific order of births carries the same probability. Given that there are 45 families where the order is G B G B B G, we can find the total number of specific permutations of boys (B) and girls (G) for six children.

There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible permutations for the sequence of births (each child can either be a boy or a girl, hence 2 choices per child and 6 children).

Since the sequences are equally probable:
1. The probability of any one specific sequence (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) occurring is \(\frac{1}{64}\).

If 45 families have the exact sequence G B G B B G, we can assume the number of total families surveyed (N) based on probability:
\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ N = 45 \cdot 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Therefore, if 2880 families were surveyed in total, the expected number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be:
\[ \frac{1}{64} \cdot 2880 = 45 \]

So our estimate for the number of families where the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
