Given the birth sequence "G B G B B G" and "B G B B B B", we first recognize that the probability of any specific sequence of boys (B) and girls (G) is equal, assuming each birth event is independent and the probability of having a boy or girl is the same (50%).

In a specific sequence of 6 children, there are \[ 2^6 = 64 \] possible unique sequences, since each child can either be a boy or a girl.

The sequence "G B G B B G" is just one of these possible sequences, and so is the sequence "B G B B B B".

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence "G B G B B G," we can then assume the number of families with the sequence "B G B B B B" would be the same, given the independence and equal probability of each sequence.

Therefore, our estimate is:

\[ \{answer: 45\} \]
