To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the fact that each birth sequence for a family with six children is equally likely. 

Given that in 45 families the birth sequence was G B G B B G, we can generalize the number of families with any specific sequence based on this information.

There are \(2^6\) (or 64) possible sequences of boys and girls for a family with six children. Each sequence has an equal probability of occurring.

If 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, we can compare this to the sequence B G B B B B.

Since each specific sequence has an equal chance and there are 64 possible sequences, each sequence should be equally represented in a large survey. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of families for a specific sequence} = \frac{\text{Total number of families surveyed}}{64} \]

Given that 45 families have the sequence G B G B B G, we can set that equal to our fraction to estimate the total number of families surveyed:

\[ 45 = \frac{\text{Total number of families surveyed}}{64} \]

Solving for the total number of families surveyed:

\[ \text{Total number of families surveyed} = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, to find the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B:

\[ \text{Number of families with sequence B G B B B B} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, our estimate is:
