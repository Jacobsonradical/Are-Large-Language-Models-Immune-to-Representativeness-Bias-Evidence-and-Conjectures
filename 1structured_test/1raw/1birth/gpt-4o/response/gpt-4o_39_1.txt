To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the assumption that the probabilities of having a boy or a girl are equal and independent of each other.

Let's first confirm that assumption by looking at the given data. The sequence G B G B B G occurs in 45 families. The total number of possible sequences of births for six children is \(2^6 = 64\), considering each child is either a boy or a girl independently.

If each sequence is equally likely, the probability of any specific sequence of births is \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Now, multiplying this probability by the total number of surveyed families \(N\) should give us the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G:

\[ 45 = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

So, the total number of surveyed families is estimated to be 2880.

Now, to find the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we use the same logic:

The probability of the specific sequence B G B B B B occurring is also \(\frac{1}{64}\). Therefore, the estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is:

\[ \text{Number of families} = N \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ \text{Number of families} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]
\[ \text{Number of families} \approx 45 \]

So, the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is about:
