To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the fact that there are \(2^6 = 64\) different possible birth sequences of six children (since each child can independently be a boy (B) or a girl (G)).

Given that there were 45 families with the exact order of births G B G B B G, we can assume each specific sequence is equally likely. Thus, the probability of any specific sequence occurring is:

\[ \text{Probability of a specific sequence} = \frac{1}{64} \]

If 45 families correspond to the sequence G B G B B G, using the probability, we can set up the proportion to find the total number of families surveyed:

\[ \frac{45}{\text{Total number of families}} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. Then,

\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]

\[ 45 = \frac{N}{64} \]

\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]

\[ N = 2880 \]

So, the estimated total number of families surveyed is 2880.

Now we need to find the estimate for the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B, which again is just a specific sequence with equal probability:

\[ \text{Estimated number of families with the sequence B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Thus, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
