To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can utilize the assumption that each combination of births (boys and girls) is equally likely.

Given that the specific order G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we first need to consider the total number of possible orders of 6 children with specific genders.

A birth sequence of six children is a specific permutation of a string of six characters, each either B or G. There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible birth sequences since each child can either be a boy or a girl.

Since the sequences are generated randomly and assuming equal probability for each sequence, the probability \(P\) of any specific sequence occurring is \( \frac{1}{64} \).

Given that the sequence G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can set this relationship up as follows:

\[ \text{Total number of families surveyed} \times P = 45 \]

Substitute \(P = \frac{1}{64}\):

\[ \text{Total number of families surveyed} \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

\[ \text{Total number of families surveyed} = 45 \times 64 \]

\[ \text{Total number of families surveyed} = 2880 \]

Now, we are interested in the number of families where the exact order is B G B B B B. Using the same probability concept:

\[ \text{Number of families with the order B G B B B B} = \text{Total number of families surveyed} \times P \]

\[ \text{Number of families with the order B G B B B B} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} \]

\[ \text{Number of families with the order B G B B B B} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
