To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we first note that the probability of any specific sequence of births (assuming each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl) is determined by the probability of each individual birth event.

Each birth event is independent with a probability of 0.5 for a boy (B) and 0.5 for a girl (G). Therefore, the probability of any specific sequence of 6 births is:

\[ P(sequence) = (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given that 45 families have the specific sequence G B G B B G, we assume the total number of families surveyed, \( N \), ensures this frequency aligns with the corresponding probability:

\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \( N \):

\[ N = 45 \cdot 64 = 2880 \]

Now, we need to estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B. Using the same probability:

\[ P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Given the total number of families \( N = 2880 \):

\[ \text{Expected number of B G B B B B sequences} = \frac{2880}{64} \]

\[ \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

So, the estimate for the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
