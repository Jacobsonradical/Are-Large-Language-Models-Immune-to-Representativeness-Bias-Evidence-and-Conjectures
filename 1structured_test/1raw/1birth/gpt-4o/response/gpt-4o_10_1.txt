To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can follow a probabilistic approach. 

Given that the exact order of births G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we need to determine the likelihood of this specific order and then use it to predict the corresponding number for the order B G B B B B.

1. **Probability of a specific birth order:**
   Each child is equally likely to be a boy or a girl. Therefore, the probability of any specific sequence of 6 children (such as G B G B B G) being born is:
   \[
   P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
   \]

2. **Using the given data:**
   If 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can set up a proportion to estimate the total number of families surveyed.
   \[
   \frac{45}{\text{Total families}} = \frac{1}{64}
   \]
   Solving for the total number of families surveyed:
   \[
   \text{Total families} = 45 \times 64 = 2880
   \]

3. **Estimating the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B:**
   Since the probability of the sequence B G B B B B is also:
   \[
   P(\text{B G B B B B}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
   \]

   We can use the total number of families surveyed to estimate the number of families with this sequence:
   \[
   \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45
   \]

Therefore, our estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
