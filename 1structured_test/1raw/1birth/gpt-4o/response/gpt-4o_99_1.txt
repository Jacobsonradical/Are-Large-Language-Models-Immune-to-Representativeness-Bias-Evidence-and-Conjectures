To calculate the estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we'll use the provided data about the number of families with the order G B G B B G.

First, let's calculate the probability of each specific order of 6 children (since each child being a boy or a girl is treated as equally likely):

1. The total number of possible birth orders for 6 children (each birth can either be a boy or a girl, so 2 options per birth) is:
\[ 2^6 = 64 \]

2. Since there are 64 equally likely outcomes (birth orders), each specific birth order has a probability of:
\[ \frac{1}{64} \]

3. We are given that 45 families have the specific birth order G B G B B G. Therefore, if we consider that the total number of families surveyed is \( N \), then 
\[ \text{Number of families with order G B G B B G} = 45 \]

4. This means that the expected number of families in the survey \( N \) is such that:
\[ \text{Probability of G B G B B G} \times N = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{64} \times N = 45 \]

5. Solving for \( N \):
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Thus, the total number of families surveyed \( N \) is 2880.

6. To find the number of families where the exact order of births is B G B B B B (with the same probability per specific birth order as before):
\[ \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Therefore, our estimate is:
{answer: 45}
