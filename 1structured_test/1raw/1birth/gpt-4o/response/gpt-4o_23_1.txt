To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the fact that each sequence of births is assumed to be equally likely. 

First, let's count the total number of different possible sequences of births in a family of six children. Each child can be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), so for six children, there are \( 2^6 = 64 \) possible sequences.

Given that there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume each sequence to have an equal probability (since all birth sequences are assumed to be equally likely), and thus the number of families with each specific sequence out of the total surveyed would be approximately the same.

If 45 families have the specific sequence G B G B B G, we can use this information to estimate the total number of families surveyed. 

Let \(N\) be the total number of families surveyed. For each of the 64 possible sequences, the number of families with each specific sequence should be:

\[ \frac{N}{64} = 45 \]

Solving for \(N\):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Therefore, we estimate the total number of families surveyed to be 2880.

Now, since we want the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, which is one specific sequence among the 64 possible:

\[ \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

Thus, the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births is B G B B B B is 45.
