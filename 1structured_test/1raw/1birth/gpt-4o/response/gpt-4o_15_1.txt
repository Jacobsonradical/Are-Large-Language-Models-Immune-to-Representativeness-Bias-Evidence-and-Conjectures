To estimate the number of families surveyed where the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the probability approach. 

There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible ways to arrange the births of six children (since each child can be either a boy or a girl).

Given that 45 families have the specific order G B G B B G, we can assume that this specific sequence is proportionate to the other sequences due to random variation (if no other information is given about the probability of having a boy or girl).

So, let's calculate the proportion of families with the sequence G B G B B G:

\[
\frac{45}{\text{Total number of families surveyed}} = \frac{1}{64}
\]

(Note: This is one particular sequence out of 64 possible sequences.)

Now, for the sequence B G B B B B, we can assume that the number of such families should be the same as for any other specific sequence in a sufficiently large sample.

Hence, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B should also be:

\[
\text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \text{Total number of families surveyed} \times \frac{1}{64}
\]

Since 45 families correspond to \(\frac{1}{64}\) of all possible sequences:

\[
\text{Total number of families surveyed} = 45 \times 64 = 2880
\]

Now, the estimate for the families with the B G B B B B sequence would be:

\[
\frac{2880}{64} = 45
\]

Thus, the estimate is:
