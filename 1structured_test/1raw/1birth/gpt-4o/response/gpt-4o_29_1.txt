To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we'll use the fact that each possible sequence of 6 births is equally likely assuming that the probability of a boy or girl being born is 50%. 

The total number of possible sequences of gender for 6 children is \(2^6 = 64\). 

Since there are 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can determine the estimated number of families surveyed by assuming that each sequence pattern should appear in proportion to its likelihood.

Given the likelihood and uniform distribution of sequences:
\[ \text{Number of families surveyed} = 45 \times \frac{64}{1} = 2880 \]
This result generalizes that there are 2880 families surveyed, with each possible unique sequence being equally probable.

Therefore, the number of families where the exact order is B G B B B B is determined by looking at the occurrence ratio derived from 45 placements of one pattern:
\[ \text{Families with B G B B B B} = \frac{45}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Thus, the estimate for the number of families with the B G B B B B pattern is:
