To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can use the concept of probability.

There are \(2^6 = 64\) possible sequences of births for 6 children (each child being either a boy (B) or a girl (G)).

Each sequence is equally likely.

Given:
- The sequence G B G B B G was observed in 45 families.
- We need to estimate the frequency of the sequence B G B B B B.

Since each sequence is equally likely, the number of families with a specific sequence should be proportionate.

Let's assume the total number of families surveyed is \(N\).

The probability of observing the sequence G B G B B G among any family is \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Given:
\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \(N\):
\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Now, the probability of observing the sequence B G B B B B is also \(\frac{1}{64}\).

Thus, the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is estimated as:
\[ N \times \frac{1}{64} = 2880 \times \frac{1}{64} = 45 \]

So, the estimated number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
