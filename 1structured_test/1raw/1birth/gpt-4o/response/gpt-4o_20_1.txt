To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, let's first determine the probability of each specific birth order occurring.

Given that each child could be either a boy (B) or a girl (G), the probability of any specific sequence of births in a family of six children is given by:

\[ P(\text{specific sequence}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

The sequence G B G B B G is one such specific sequence, and it was observed in 45 families.

To find the total number of families surveyed (\( N \)), we use the proportion:

\[ \frac{45}{N} = \frac{1}{64} \]

Solving for \( N \):

\[ N = 45 \times 64 = 2880 \]

Thus, the total number of families surveyed is estimated to be 2880.

Now, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is the same as any other specific sequence of six children. Using that same probability:

\[ P(B G B B B B) = \frac{1}{64} \]

To find the estimated number of families with this exact birth order:

\[ \text{Number of families with B G B B B B} = \frac{1}{64} \times 2880 = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the number of families with the exact order B G B B B B is:
