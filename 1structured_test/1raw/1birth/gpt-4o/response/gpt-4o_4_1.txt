To estimate the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we'll use the assumption that each birth is equally likely to be a boy or a girl (probability 0.5 for each).

First, let's compute the probability of the birth sequence G B G B B G:
- The probability of G B G B B G is (0.5)^6 = 1/64.

Next, let's compute the probability of the birth sequence B G B B B B:
- The probability of B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6 = 1/64.

Since all birth orders are equally likely, we assume the same probability for any specific sequence of 6 births. Given that 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can use this to estimate the total number of families surveyed.

Let \( N \) be the total number of families surveyed. The expected number of families with a specific sequence (like G B G B B G) out of \( N \) families can be represented by:
\[ \frac{N}{64} = 45 \]

Solving for \( N \):
\[ N = 45 \times 64 \]
\[ N = 2880 \]

Now, the number of families with the birth sequence B G B B B B is:
\[ \frac{N}{64} = \frac{2880}{64} = 45 \]

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is 45.

{answer: 45}
