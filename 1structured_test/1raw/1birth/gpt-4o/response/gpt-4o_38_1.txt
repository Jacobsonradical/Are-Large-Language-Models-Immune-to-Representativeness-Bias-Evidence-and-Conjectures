To estimate the number of families in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B, we can compare the probability of this specific sequence to that of the given sequence G B G B B G.

Each child being a boy or a girl is typically considered to be an independent event, and the probability for each event (boy or girl) is usually assumed to be 0.5. Therefore, the probability of any specific sequence of births can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual birth in the sequence.

For G B G B B G, the probability is:
\[ P(G \, B \, G \, B \, B \, G) = 0.5^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Similarly, for B G B B B B, the probability is:
\[ P(B \, G \, B \, B \, B \, B) = 0.5^6 = \frac{1}{64} \]

Since both sequences have the same probability, it stands to reason that the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would be the same as the number of families with the sequence G B G B B G, which is given as 45 families.

Therefore, my estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was B G B B B B is:
\[ \{answer: 45\} \]
