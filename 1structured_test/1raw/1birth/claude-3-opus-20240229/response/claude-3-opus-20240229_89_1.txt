To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the available information.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50% each).
2. The birth order of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order of G B G B B G.

Let's calculate the probability of the birth order G B G B B G:
P(G B G B B G) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since there are 45 families with this specific birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:
Total families surveyed = 45 × 64 = 2,880

Now, let's calculate the probability of the birth order B G B B B B:
P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, multiply the total number of families surveyed by the probability of this specific birth order:
Families with B G B B B B = 2,880 × (1/64) = 45

{answer: 45}
