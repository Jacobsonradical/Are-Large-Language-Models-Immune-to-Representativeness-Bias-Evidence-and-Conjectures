To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of having a specific birth order of 6 children is:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since the survey found 45 families with the exact order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as:

45 / (1/64) = 45 * 64 = 2880

Now, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:

2880 * (1/64) = 45

{answer: 45}
