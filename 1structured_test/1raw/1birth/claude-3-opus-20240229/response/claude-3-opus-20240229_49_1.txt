To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order of G B G B B G.
- We need to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

The probability of any specific birth order is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, as each child has a 1/2 probability of being either a boy or a girl, and there are 6 children in total.

Let the total number of families surveyed be x.

The expected number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is:
x * (1/64) = 45

Solving for x:
x = 45 * 64 = 2880

Therefore, the total number of families surveyed is estimated to be 2880.

The expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:
2880 * (1/64) = 45

{answer: 45}
