To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- Total number of possible birth orders for 6 children: 2^6 = 64
- Each birth order is equally likely

Therefore, we can estimate that out of the 45 families surveyed, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:

{answer: 45 / 64 â‰ˆ 0.703125}

This means that approximately 1 family out of the 45 surveyed would have the birth order B G B B B B.
