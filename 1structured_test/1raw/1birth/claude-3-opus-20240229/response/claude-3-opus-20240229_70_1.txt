To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely, with a probability of 0.5 each.
2. The gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.

The probability of the birth order G B G B B G is (0.5)^6 = 1/64, as there are 6 children, and each child has a 0.5 probability of being either a boy or a girl.

Similarly, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6 = 1/64.

Since both birth orders have the same probability, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is approximately equal to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.
