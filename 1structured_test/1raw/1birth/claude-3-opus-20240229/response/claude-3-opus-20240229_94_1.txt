To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of having a specific birth order of 6 children is:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64

This means that, on average, out of every 64 families with 6 children, we would expect one family to have the exact birth order we're looking for (B G B B B B).

Given that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, we can set up a proportion:

45 / x = 1 / 64

Here, x represents the total number of families surveyed. Cross-multiplying:

45 * 64 = x * 1
2880 = x

Therefore, the total number of families surveyed is estimated to be 2880.

To find the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can divide the total number of families by 64:

2880 / 64 = 45

{answer: 45}
