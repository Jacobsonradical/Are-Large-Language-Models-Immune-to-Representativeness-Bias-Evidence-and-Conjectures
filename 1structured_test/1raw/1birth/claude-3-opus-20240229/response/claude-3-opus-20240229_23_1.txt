To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of any specific birth order is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, as there are 6 children, each with a 1/2 probability of being either a boy or a girl.

Using the information given, we can set up a proportion:
45 families : 1/64 = x families : 1/64

Cross-multiplying, we get:
45 = x

Therefore, if 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate that a similar number of families, about 45, would have the birth order B G B B B B.
