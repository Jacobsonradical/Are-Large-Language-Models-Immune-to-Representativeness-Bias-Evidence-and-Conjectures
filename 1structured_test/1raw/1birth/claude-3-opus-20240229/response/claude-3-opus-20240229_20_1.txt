To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).
2. The birth order of children in a family is independent of other families.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.

Let's calculate the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G:

P(G B G B B G) = (0.5)^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625

Since 45 families have this birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:

Total families surveyed ≈ 45 / 0.015625 = 2880

Now, let's calculate the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B:

P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, multiply the total number of families surveyed by the probability of this specific birth order:

Families with B G B B B B ≈ 2880 × 0.015625 = 45

{answer: 45}

Please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions. The actual number of families with the birth order B G B B B B might differ from this estimate.
