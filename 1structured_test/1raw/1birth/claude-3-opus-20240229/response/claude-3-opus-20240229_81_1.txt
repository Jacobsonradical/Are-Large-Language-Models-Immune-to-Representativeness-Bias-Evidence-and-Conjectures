To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of giving birth to a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).
2. The birth order of each family is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order G B G B B G is:
P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 1/64 (since there are 6 children, and each has a 0.5 probability of being either a boy or a girl)

Similarly, the probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B is also:
P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 1/64

If we assume that the surveyed families are a representative sample of the population, then the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B should be approximately equal to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

{answer: 45 families}
