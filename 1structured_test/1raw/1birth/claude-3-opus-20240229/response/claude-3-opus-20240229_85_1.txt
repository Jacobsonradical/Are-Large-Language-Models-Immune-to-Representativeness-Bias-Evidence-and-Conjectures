To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of any specific birth order is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, as there are 6 children and each child has a 1/2 probability of being either a boy or a girl.

Given that 45 families have the exact birth order G B G B B G, we can set up a proportion:

45 / x = 1/64

where x is the total number of families surveyed.

Solving for x:
x = 45 * 64 = 2880

Now, the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would also be 1/64 of the total families surveyed.

1/64 * 2880 = 45

{answer: 45}
