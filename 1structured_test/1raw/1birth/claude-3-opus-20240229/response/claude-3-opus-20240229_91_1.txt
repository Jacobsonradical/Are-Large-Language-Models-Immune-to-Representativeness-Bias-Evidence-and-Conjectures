To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of any specific birth order is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, as there are two possible outcomes (boy or girl) for each of the six births.

Given that there were 45 families with the exact birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:

Total families surveyed = 45 / (1/64) = 45 * 64 = 2,880

Now, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:

Families with B G B B B B = (1/64) * 2,880 = 45

Therefore, my estimate is:

{answer: 45}
