To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each).
2. The birth order of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order of G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order of G B G B B G is the same as the probability of having B G B B B B, as both have the same number of boys and girls and the order is specific.

P(G B G B B G) = P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 1/64

If 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, then we can estimate that approximately 45 families would also have the birth order B G B B B B.

{answer: 45}
