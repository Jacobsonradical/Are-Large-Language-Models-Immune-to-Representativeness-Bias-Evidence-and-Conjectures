To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely, with a probability of 0.5 each.
2. The gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.
- All families surveyed have exactly six children.

The probability of having the exact birth order G B G B B G is the same as the probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B, as both have the same number of boys and girls and the probability of each gender is equal.

P(G B G B B G) = P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625

Since we know that 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:

Total families surveyed ≈ 45 / P(G B G B B G) = 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2880

Now, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

Families with B G B B B B ≈ Total families surveyed × P(B G B B B B) ≈ 2880 × 0.015625 ≈ 45

{answer: 45}

Please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and assumptions. The actual number of families with the birth order B G B B B B might differ from this estimate.
