To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make a few assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of giving birth to a boy or a girl is equal (50% each).
2. The birth order of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order of G B G B B G.

Let's calculate the probability of having the birth order G B G B B G:

P(G B G B B G) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.0156

Since there are 45 families with this specific birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:

Total families surveyed ≈ 45 / P(G B G B B G) = 45 / (1/64) = 45 × 64 = 2,880

Now, let's calculate the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.0156

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we multiply the total number of families surveyed by the probability of this specific birth order:

Families with B G B B B B ≈ Total families surveyed × P(B G B B B B)
                         ≈ 2,880 × (1/64)
                         ≈ 45

{answer: 45}
