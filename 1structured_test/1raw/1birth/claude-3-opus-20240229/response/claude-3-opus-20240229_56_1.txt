To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely, and the probability is constant across all births.
2. The gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.

Using these assumptions, we can calculate the probability of a family having the birth order G B G B B G, which is (1/2)^6 = 1/64 (since each child has a 50% chance of being either a boy or a girl).

If 45 families represent 1/64 of the total number of families surveyed, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed to be: 45 × 64 = 2,880.

Now, the probability of a family having the birth order B G B B B B is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64. Therefore, we can estimate that out of the total 2,880 families, about 1/64 of them would have the birth order B G B B B B.

Estimated number of families with birth order B G B B B B = 2,880 × (1/64) = 45.
