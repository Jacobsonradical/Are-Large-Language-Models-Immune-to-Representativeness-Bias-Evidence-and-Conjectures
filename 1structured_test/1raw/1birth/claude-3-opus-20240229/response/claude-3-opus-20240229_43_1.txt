To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of having the exact birth order G B G B B G is:
(1/2)^6 = 1/64

The probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B is also:
(1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since the probabilities are equal, we can expect the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to be roughly the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G

Estimate:
The number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would also be approximately 45.

{answer: 45}
