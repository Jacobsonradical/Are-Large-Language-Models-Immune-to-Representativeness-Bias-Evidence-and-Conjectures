To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of a family having the exact birth order G B G B B G is:
(1/2)^6 = 1/64

Similarly, the probability of a family having the exact birth order B G B B B B is also:
(1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since the probabilities are equal, we can assume that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is approximately equal to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.

{answer: 45}
