To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and perform a calculation.

Assumptions:
- The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50% each).
- The gender of each child is independent of the others.

With these assumptions, we can calculate the probability of the birth order B G B B B B:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625

Now, let's use the given information:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.
- The probability of this birth order is also 1/64.

We can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing the number of families with the specific birth order by the probability of that birth order:

Total families surveyed ≈ 45 / (1/64) = 45 × 64 = 2,880

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we multiply the total number of families surveyed by the probability of that specific birth order:

Families with B G B B B B ≈ 2,880 × (1/64) ≈ 45

{answer: 45}
