To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of having a specific birth order of 6 children is:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64 â‰ˆ 0.015625

If there were 45 families with the exact birth order G B G B B G, we can set up a proportion to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

45/0.015625 = x/0.015625

Solving for x:

x = 45

Therefore, we can estimate that there were also around 45 families surveyed with the exact birth order B G B B B B.

{answer: 45}
