To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to assume that each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order G B G B B G.
- Total number of possible birth orders for 6 children = 2^6 = 64 (each child can be either a boy or a girl)

The probability of any specific birth order (assuming equal probabilities) = 1/64

Since we know that 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as follows:

Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = 45 (since both birth orders have the same probability)

{answer: 45}
