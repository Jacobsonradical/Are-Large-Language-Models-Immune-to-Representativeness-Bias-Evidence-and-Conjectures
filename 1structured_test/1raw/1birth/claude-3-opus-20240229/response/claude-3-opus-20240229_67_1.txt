To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of giving birth to a boy or a girl is equal (50% each).
2. The birth order of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order of G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order of G B G B B G is the same as having B G B B B B, as both have the same number of boys and girls and the probability of each birth order is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Let's denote the total number of families surveyed as x.

The expected number of families with the birth order G B G B B G is:
x * (1/64) = 45

Solving for x:
x = 45 * 64 = 2880

Now, the expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
2880 * (1/64) = 45

Therefore, based on the given information and assumptions, the estimated number of families surveyed with the exact birth order of B G B B B B is 45.

{answer: 45}
