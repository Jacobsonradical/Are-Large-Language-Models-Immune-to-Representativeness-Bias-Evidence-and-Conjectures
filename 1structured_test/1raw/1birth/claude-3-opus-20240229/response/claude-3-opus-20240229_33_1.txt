To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the provided information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely, with a probability of 0.5 each.
2. The gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order of G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order of G B G B B G is the same as the probability of having the exact birth order of B G B B B B, as both have the same number of boys and girls and the probability of each gender is equal.

Let's denote the total number of families surveyed as x.

Probability of G B G B B G = 45 / x
Probability of B G B B B B = Probability of G B G B B G (based on our assumptions)

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would also be 45.

{answer: 45}
