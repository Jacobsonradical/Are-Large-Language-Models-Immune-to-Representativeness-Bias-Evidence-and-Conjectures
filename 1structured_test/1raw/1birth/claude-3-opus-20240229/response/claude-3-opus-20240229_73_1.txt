To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make a few assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of giving birth to a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).
2. The birth order of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.

Let's calculate the probability of the birth order G B G B B G:
P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 1/64 (since there are 6 children, and each has a 0.5 probability of being either a boy or a girl)

So, if 45 families have this specific birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:
Total families surveyed = 45 / P(G B G B B G) = 45 * 64 = 2880

Now, let's calculate the probability of the birth order B G B B B B:
P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 1/64 (the same as for G B G B B G)

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we multiply the total number of families surveyed by the probability of this specific birth order:
Families with B G B B B B = Total families surveyed * P(B G B B B B) = 2880 * (1/64) = 45

{answer: 45}
