To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of a family having the exact birth order B G B B B B is:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64 â‰ˆ 0.015625

If 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, and this probability is the same as the probability of having the birth order B G B B B B, we can set up a proportion to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

45 / x = 64 / 1

Solving for x:
x = 45 * 64 = 2880

Therefore, out of 2880 families surveyed, we would expect about 45 of them to have the birth order B G B B B B.
