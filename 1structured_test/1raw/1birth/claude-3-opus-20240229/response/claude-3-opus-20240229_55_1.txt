To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make a few assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The chances of having a boy or a girl are equal (50% each).
2. The birth order of each family is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order G B G B B G is equal to the probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B, as both have the same number of boys and girls and the chances of having a boy or a girl are equal.

Let's denote the total number of families surveyed as n.

Probability of having the birth order G B G B B G = 45 / n
Probability of having the birth order B G B B B B = Probability of having the birth order G B G B B G (based on our assumptions)

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G, which is 45.

{answer: 45}
