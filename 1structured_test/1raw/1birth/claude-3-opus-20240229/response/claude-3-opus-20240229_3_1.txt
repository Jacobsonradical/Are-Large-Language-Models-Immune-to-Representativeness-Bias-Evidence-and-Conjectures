To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each).
2. The birth order of each family is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.
- The total number of possible birth orders for a family with 6 children is 2^6 = 64 (because each child can be either a boy or a girl).

The probability of a family having the exact birth order G B G B B G is (0.5)^6 = 1/64, as the probability of each individual birth being a boy or a girl is 0.5.

Since there are 45 families with this specific birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:
Total families surveyed ≈ 45 × 64 = 2,880

Now, the probability of a family having the exact birth order B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6 = 1/64.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:
Families with B G B B B B ≈ (1/64) × 2,880 ≈ 45

{answer: 45}
