To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).
2. The birth order of children in a family is independent of the birth order in other families.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order G B G B B G is the same as the probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B, as both consist of 2 girls and 4 boys.

Let's denote the total number of surveyed families as n.

Probability of having the birth order G B G B B G = 45 / n
Probability of having the birth order B G B B B B = x / n, where x is the number of families with this birth order.

Since these probabilities are equal, we can say:
45 / n = x / n

Therefore, x = 45

{answer: 45}
