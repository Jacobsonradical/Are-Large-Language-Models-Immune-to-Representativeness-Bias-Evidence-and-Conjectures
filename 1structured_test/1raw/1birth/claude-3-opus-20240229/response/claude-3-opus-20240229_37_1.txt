To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make a key assumption:

Assumption: The probability of giving birth to a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order of G B G B B G
- Total number of possible birth orders for 6 children = 2^6 = 64 (because each child can be either a boy or a girl)

Step 1: Calculate the probability of the birth order G B G B B G
P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 1/64 (because the probability of each child being a boy or a girl is 0.5)

Step 2: Calculate the probability of the birth order B G B B B B
P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 1/64 (same reason as above)

Since both birth orders have the same probability, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B will be the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.

{answer: 45 families}

Please note that this is an estimate based on the given assumption and the limited information provided. In reality, there might be slight variations due to the sample size and other factors.
