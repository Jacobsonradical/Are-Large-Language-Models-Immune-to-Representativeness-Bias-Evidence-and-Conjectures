To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

With this assumption, the probability of any specific birth order is:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64 â‰ˆ 0.015625

Since there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can set up a proportion to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

45 : 1/64 = x : 1/64

Here, x represents the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Solving for x:

x = 45 * (1/64) / (1/64) = 45

Therefore, based on the given information and assumptions, my estimate for the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
