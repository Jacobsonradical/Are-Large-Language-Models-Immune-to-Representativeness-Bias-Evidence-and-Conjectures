To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and perform a calculation.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (1/2 for each).
2. The gender of each child is independent of the others.

Calculation:
The probability of having the exact birth order G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, as there are 6 children and each child has a 1/2 probability of being either a boy or a girl.

Similarly, the probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B to be the same, assuming equal probabilities.

{answer: 45}
