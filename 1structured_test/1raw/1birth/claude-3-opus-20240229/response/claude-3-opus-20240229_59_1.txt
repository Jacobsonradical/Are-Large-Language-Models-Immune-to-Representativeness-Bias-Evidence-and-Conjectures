To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order of G B G B B G.
- Each family has 6 children.

The probability of a family having the exact birth order of G B G B B G is the same as the probability of having the exact birth order of B G B B B B, as both sequences have 4 boys and 2 girls.

P(G B G B B G) = P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Let the total number of families surveyed be x.

45/x = 1/64
x = 45 * 64 = 2880

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed with the exact birth order of B G B B B B is also 45.

{answer: 45}
