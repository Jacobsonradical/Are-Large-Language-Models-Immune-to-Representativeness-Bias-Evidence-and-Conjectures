To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely, with a probability of 0.5 each.
2. The gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order G B G B B G.

The probability of the birth order G B G B B G is the same as that of B G B B B B, as both have the same number of boys and girls and the probability of each gender is equal.

P(G B G B B G) = P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 1/64

Let the total number of families surveyed be x.

(1/64) * x = 45

x = 45 * 64 = 2880

Since the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also 1/64, we can estimate the number of families with this birth order as:

(1/64) * 2880 = 45

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B is also 45.

{answer: 45}
