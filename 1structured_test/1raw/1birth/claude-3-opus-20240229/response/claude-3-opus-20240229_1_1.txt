To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

With this assumption, the probability of any specific birth order is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, since there are 6 children and each child has a 1/2 probability of being either a boy or a girl.

Given that there were 45 families with the exact birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of this specific birth order:

Total families surveyed ≈ 45 ÷ (1/64) = 45 × 64 = 2880

Now, to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we multiply the total number of families surveyed by the probability of this specific birth order:

Families with birth order B G B B B B ≈ 2880 × (1/64) = 45

Therefore, based on the assumptions and the given information, the estimate for the number of families surveyed with the exact birth order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
