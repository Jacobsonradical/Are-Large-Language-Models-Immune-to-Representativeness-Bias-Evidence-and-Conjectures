To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G
- Each birth has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl

The probability of a family having the exact birth order G B G B B G is:
(1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since there are 45 families with this birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:
Total families surveyed = 45 × 64 = 2,880

Now, the probability of a family having the exact birth order B G B B B B is also:
(1/2)^6 = 1/64

To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we multiply the total number of families surveyed by the probability of this specific birth order:
Families with B G B B B B = 2,880 × (1/64) = 45

{answer: 45}
