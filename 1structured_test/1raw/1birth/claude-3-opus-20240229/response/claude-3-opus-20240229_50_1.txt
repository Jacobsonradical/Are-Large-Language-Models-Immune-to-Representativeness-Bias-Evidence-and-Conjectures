To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of a family having the exact birth order B G B B B B is:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64 = 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can set up a proportion to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B:

45 / x = (1/2)^6 / (1/2)^6

Here, x represents the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Solving for x:

x = 45

Therefore, we can estimate that there were also 45 families surveyed with the exact birth order B G B B B B.

{answer: 45}
