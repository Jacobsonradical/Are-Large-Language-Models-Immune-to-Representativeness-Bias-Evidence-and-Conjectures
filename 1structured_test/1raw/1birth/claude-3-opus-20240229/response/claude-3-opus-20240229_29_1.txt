To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make a few assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each).
2. The birth order of each family is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order G B G B B G is:
(0.5)^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625

If 45 families represent a probability of 0.015625, then the total number of families surveyed (x) can be estimated as:
45 / x = 0.015625
x = 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2880

Now, the probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625.

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:
0.015625 * 2880 ≈ 45

{answer: 45}
