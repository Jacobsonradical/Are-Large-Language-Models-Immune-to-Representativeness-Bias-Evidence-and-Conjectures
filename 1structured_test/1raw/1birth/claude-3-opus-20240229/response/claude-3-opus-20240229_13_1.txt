To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use probability.

Assumptions:
- The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each).
- The gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order G B G B B G is:
P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 1/64 (since there are 6 children and each has a 0.5 probability of being either gender)

Let's assume that the total number of families surveyed is 'n'.

Then, 45/n = 1/64 (the fraction of families with the specific birth order should equal the probability of that birth order occurring)

Solving for n:
n = 45 * 64 = 2880

So, the estimated total number of families surveyed is 2880.

Now, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also 1/64 (same as G B G B B G, as it also has 6 children).

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
(1/64) * 2880 = 45

{answer: 45}
