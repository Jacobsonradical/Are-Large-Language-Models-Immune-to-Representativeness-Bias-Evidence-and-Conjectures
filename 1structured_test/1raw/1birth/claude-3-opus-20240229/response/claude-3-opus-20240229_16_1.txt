To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of a family having exactly the birth order B G B B B B is:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64 â‰ˆ 0.015625

Given that 45 families had the exact birth order G B G B B G, we can set up a proportion to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Let x be the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

45/x = (1/64)/(1/64)

Solving for x:

x = 45

Therefore, we can estimate that approximately 45 families out of the total surveyed would have the exact birth order B G B B B B.
