To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of a family having the exact birth order G B G B B G is:
(1/2)^6 = 1/64

Similarly, the probability of a family having the exact birth order B G B B B B is also:
(1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since the probabilities are equal, we can expect the number of families with each birth order to be approximately the same.

Given that 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate that a similar number of families, about 45, would have the birth order B G B B B B.

{answer: approximately 45 families}
