To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of any specific birth order is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, as there are 6 children and each child has a 1/2 probability of being either a boy or a girl.

Since there are 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of this specific birth order:

Total families surveyed = 45 / (1/64) = 45 * 64 = 2880

Now, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be the total number of families surveyed multiplied by the probability of this specific birth order:

Families with B G B B B B = 2880 * (1/64) = 45

{answer: 45}
