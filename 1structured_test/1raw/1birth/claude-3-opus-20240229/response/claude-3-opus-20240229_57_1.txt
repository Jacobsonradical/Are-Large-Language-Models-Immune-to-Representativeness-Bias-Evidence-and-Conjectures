To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the provided information.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each).
2. The birth order of each family is independent of others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order of G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order of G B G B B G is (0.5)^6 = 1/64, as there are six children, and each child has a 0.5 probability of being either a boy or a girl.

Similarly, the probability of having the exact birth order of B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6 = 1/64.

Since both birth orders have the same probability, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.
