To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- Total number of possible birth orders for 6 children: 2^6 = 64
- Each birth order is equally likely

Therefore, the probability of any specific birth order, such as G B G B B G or B G B B B B, is 1/64.

If 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as:

Total families surveyed = 45 × 64 = 2,880

Since the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also 1/64, we can estimate the number of families with this specific order as:

Families with B G B B B B = 2,880 × (1/64) = 45

{answer: 45}
