To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- Total number of possible birth orders for 6 children: 2^6 = 64 (because each child can be either a boy or a girl)
- Number of families with the birth order G B G B B G: 45

The probability of any specific birth order is:
P(specific birth order) = 1/64

Since we know that 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:
Total families surveyed = 45 / P(G B G B B G) = 45 / (1/64) = 45 * 64 = 2880

Now, the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also 1/64. So, we can estimate the number of families with this birth order:
Families with B G B B B B = Total families surveyed * P(B G B B B B)
                          = 2880 * (1/64) = 45

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
