To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the information given about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each).
2. The birth order of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order G B G B B G.

The probability of the birth order G B G B B G is the same as B G B B B B, as both have the same number of boys and girls, and the order is determined independently.

P(G B G B B G) = P(B G B B B B) = (0.5)^6 = 1/64

If 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, then the total number of families surveyed can be estimated as:

Total families surveyed = 45 / P(G B G B B G) = 45 * 64 = 2,880

Since the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is the same as G B G B B G, we can estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B as:

Families with B G B B B B = Total families surveyed * P(B G B B B B) = 2,880 * (1/64) = 45

{answer: 45}
