To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each).
2. The birth order of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order of G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order of G B G B B G is:
(0.5)^6 = 1/64 (since there are 6 children, and each child has a 0.5 probability of being either a boy or a girl)

Similarly, the probability of having the exact birth order of B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6 = 1/64.

Since the probabilities are equal, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is also close to 45.

{answer: 45}
