To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

Since there are 6 children in each family, there are 2^6 = 64 possible ordered combinations of boys and girls. Only one of these combinations is B G B B B B.

Therefore, the probability of a family having the exact birth order B G B B B B is 1/64.

If there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by multiplying 45 by 64.

Total families surveyed = 45 * 64 = 2880

Now, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:

(1/64) * 2880 = 45

{answer: 45}
