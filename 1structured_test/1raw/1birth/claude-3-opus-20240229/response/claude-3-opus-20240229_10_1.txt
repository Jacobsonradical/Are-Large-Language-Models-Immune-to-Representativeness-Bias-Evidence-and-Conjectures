To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of any specific birth order is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, since there are 6 children and each child has a 1/2 probability of being either a boy or a girl.

If there were 45 families with the exact birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by dividing 45 by the probability of this specific birth order:

Total families surveyed = 45 / (1/64) = 45 * 64 = 2880

Since the probability of any specific birth order is the same (1/64), we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would also be around 45.

{answer: 45}
