To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the provided information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).
2. The birth order of each family is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of the birth order G B G B B G.
P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

Step 2: Calculate the probability of the birth order B G B B B B.
P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 0.015625

The probabilities are the same because both birth orders have the same number of boys and girls.

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
Since the probabilities are the same and we have 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate that there are also around 45 families with the birth order B G B B B B.
