To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

With this assumption, we can calculate the probability of a family having the exact birth order B G B B B B:

P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since the total number of families surveyed is not given, let's assume it to be x.

The expected number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be:

x * P(B G B B B B) = x * (1/64)

Now, we know that 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G. Using the same probability calculation, we get:

45 = x * P(G B G B B G) = x * (1/64)

Solving for x:
x = 45 * 64 = 2880

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:

2880 * (1/64) = 45

{answer: 45}
