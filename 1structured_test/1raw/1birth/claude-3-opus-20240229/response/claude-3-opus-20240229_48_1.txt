To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of giving birth to a boy or a girl is equal (50% each).
2. The birth order of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order of G B G B B G.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of the birth order G B G B B G.
P(G B G B B G) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Step 2: Calculate the probability of the birth order B G B B B B.
P(B G B B B B) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64

Since both birth orders have the same probability, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is equal to the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.
