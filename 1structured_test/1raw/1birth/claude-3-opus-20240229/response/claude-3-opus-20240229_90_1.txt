To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of a family having the exact birth order B G B B B B is:

(1/2)^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625

Since there were 45 families with the birth order G B G B B G, we can set up a proportion to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Let x be the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

x / (x + 45) = 1/64

Solving for x:
x ≈ 0.71

Therefore, my estimate for the number of families surveyed with the exact birth order B G B B B B is:
