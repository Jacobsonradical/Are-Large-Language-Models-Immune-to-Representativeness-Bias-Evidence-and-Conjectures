To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use probability.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each).
2. The gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of a family having the exact birth order G B G B B G is:
P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 1/64 (since there are 6 children, and each has a 0.5 probability of being either a boy or a girl)

Similarly, the probability of a family having the exact birth order B G B B B B is:
P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 1/64

Since the probabilities are the same, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.
