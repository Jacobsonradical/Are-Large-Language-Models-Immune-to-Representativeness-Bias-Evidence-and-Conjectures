To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

Since there are 6 children in each family, there are 2^6 = 64 possible ordered combinations of boys and girls.

Out of these 64 combinations, only one specific order is B G B B B B.

So, the probability of a family having the exact birth order B G B B B B is 1/64.

Given that 45 families have the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:
- Probability of the order G B G B B G = 1/64
- Number of families with order G B G B B G = 45
- Estimated total number of families = 45 × 64 = 2880

Since the probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also 1/64, we can estimate the number of families with this order:
- Estimated number of families with order B G B B B B = 2880 × (1/64) = 45

{answer: 45}
