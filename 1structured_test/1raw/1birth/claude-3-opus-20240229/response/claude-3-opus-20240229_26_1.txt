To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the principle of probability.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each).
2. The gender of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order of G B G B B G.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of the birth order G B G B B G.
P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 1/64 (since there are 6 children, and each has a 0.5 probability of being either a boy or a girl)

Step 2: Calculate the probability of the birth order B G B B B B.
P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 1/64 (same reasoning as above)

Step 3: Estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.
Since the probabilities of both birth orders are equal, we can assume that the number of families with each birth order is also roughly equal.

Estimated number of families with B G B B B B = 45
