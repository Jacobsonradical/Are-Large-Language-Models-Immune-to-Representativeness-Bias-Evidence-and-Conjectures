To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each).
2. The birth order of each family is independent of others.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order G B G B B G is:
P(G B G B B G) = 0.5^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625

Similarly, the probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B is also:
P(B G B B B B) = 0.5^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625

Since the probabilities are equal and the birth orders are independent, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is approximately the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.
