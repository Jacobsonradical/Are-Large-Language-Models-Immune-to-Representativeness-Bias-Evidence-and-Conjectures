To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of giving birth to a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).
2. The birth order of each family is independent of others.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order G B G B B G is the same as the probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B, as both have the same number of boys and girls and the probability of each gender is equal.

Let's denote the total number of families surveyed as x.

Probability of having the birth order G B G B B G = 45 / x
Probability of having the birth order B G B B B B = Probability of having the birth order G B G B B G (based on our assumptions)

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would also be 45.

{answer: 45}
