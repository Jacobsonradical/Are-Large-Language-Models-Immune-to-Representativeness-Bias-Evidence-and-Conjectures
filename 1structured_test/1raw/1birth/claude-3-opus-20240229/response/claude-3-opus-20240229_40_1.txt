To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use probability.

Assumptions:
1. Each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl.
2. The gender of each child is independent of the others.

With these assumptions, the probability of any specific birth order is (1/2)^6 = 1/64, as there are six children and each child has a 1/2 probability of being either a boy or a girl.

Given:
- 45 families have the exact birth order of G B G B B G.
- The probability of this specific birth order is also 1/64.

Let's assume that the survey is a representative sample of all families with six children in the city. In that case, we can estimate the total number of families with six children by dividing the number of families with the specific birth order by the probability of that birth order.

Total families with six children = 45 / (1/64) = 45 * 64 = 2,880

Now, to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we multiply the total number of families by the probability of this specific birth order.

Families with birth order B G B B B B = 2,880 * (1/64) = 45

Therefore, my estimate for the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B is:

{answer: 45}
