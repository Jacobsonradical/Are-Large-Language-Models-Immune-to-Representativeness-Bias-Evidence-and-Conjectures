To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use probability.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 each).
2. The gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of the exact birth order B G B B B B is:
P(B G B B B B) = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.015625 (or 1/64)

The probability of the exact birth order G B G B B G is also:
P(G B G B B G) = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.015625 (or 1/64)

Since 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, and the probability of this birth order is equal to the probability of B G B B B B, we can estimate that approximately 45 families also have the birth order B G B B B B.
