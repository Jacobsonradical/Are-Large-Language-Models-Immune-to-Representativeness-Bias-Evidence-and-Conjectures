To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50% each).
2. The birth order of each child is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order G B G B B G is the same as the probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B, as both have the same number of boys and girls and the probability of each gender is equal.

Let's denote the total number of surveyed families as x.

The probability of having the birth order G B G B B G (or B G B B B B) is:
(1/2)^6 = 1/64

So, the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G (or B G B B B B) can be estimated as:
x * (1/64) = 45

Solving for x:
x = 45 * 64 = 2880

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B is:
2880 * (1/64) = 45

{answer: 45}
