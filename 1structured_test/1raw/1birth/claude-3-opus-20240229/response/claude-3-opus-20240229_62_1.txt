To estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we need to make some assumptions and use the given information about the families with the birth order G B G B B G.

Assumptions:
1. The probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (0.5 for each).
2. The birth order of each family is independent of the others.

Given:
- 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G.

The probability of having the exact birth order G B G B B G is:
(0.5)^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625

Since 45 families have this birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:
Total families surveyed ≈ 45 / 0.015625 ≈ 2880

Now, the probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B is also (0.5)^6 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625

Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B is:
Families with B G B B B B ≈ 2880 × 0.015625 ≈ 45

{answer: 45}
