To estimate the number of families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B, we can assume that each child has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of each child is independent of the others.

The probability of having the exact birth order B G B B B B is:

(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64

Since there were 45 families with the exact birth order G B G B B G, we can set up a proportion to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

Let x be the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B.

45 / (1/64) = x / (1/64)

Solving for x:

45 = x

Therefore, the estimated number of families surveyed with the exact birth order B G B B B B is 45.

{answer: 45}
