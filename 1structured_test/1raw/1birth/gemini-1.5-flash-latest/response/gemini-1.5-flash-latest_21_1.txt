Here's how we can estimate:

* **Assumptions:** We're assuming that each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the others.
* **Probability:** The probability of any specific order of six births (like G B G B B G) is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.
* **Estimation:** Since 45 families had the order G B G B B G, which represents 1/64 of all possible orders, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

   Total families â‰ˆ 45 families * 64 = 2880 families

**Therefore, {answer: 2880}**
