{answer: 2} 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming that the probability of having a boy or girl is equal (50/50), each possible birth order sequence is equally likely.
* **Sample Size:** We have a sample size of 45 families where the birth order is G B G B B G.
* **Estimate:**  Since each birth order is equally likely, we would expect to see approximately the same number of families for each possible sequence.  Therefore, we can estimate that around 2 families would have the sequence B G B B B B.

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate.  The actual number of families with this birth order could be higher or lower due to random variation.
