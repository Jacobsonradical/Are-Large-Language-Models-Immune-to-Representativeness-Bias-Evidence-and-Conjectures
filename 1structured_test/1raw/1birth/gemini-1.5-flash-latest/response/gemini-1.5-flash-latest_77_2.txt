Here's how to think about this problem:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming there's an equal chance of having a boy or girl, each birth order sequence is equally likely. 
* **Many Possibilities:**  There are many possible birth order sequences for a family of six children (2^6 = 64 possibilities). 
* **Estimate:**  Since the sequence G B G B B G was observed in 45 families out of the total, we can estimate that the sequence B G B B B B would also be observed in roughly the same number of families.

**Answer: {answer: 45}**
