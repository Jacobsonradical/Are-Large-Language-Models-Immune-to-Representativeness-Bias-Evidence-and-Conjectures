Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Understanding the Problem:** We're dealing with probability and assuming that the sex of each child is independent of the others (meaning the birth of a boy doesn't affect the likelihood of the next child being a boy or girl).

* **Probability of a Specific Order:**  The probability of a specific birth order like G B G B B G is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64 (since there's a 1/2 chance of having a boy or girl for each child).

* **Estimating the Total Number:**  If 45 families out of the total surveyed have the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by using the probability:

    *  (1/64) of the total families = 45 families
    *  Total families = 45 * 64 = 2880

* **Probability of B G B B B B:**  The probability of the birth order B G B B B B is also (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.

* **Estimating the Number with B G B B B B:** Since the probabilities are the same, we can expect a similar number of families to have this birth order.

**Answer: {answer: 45}** 

While we can't be 100% certain, we can estimate that approximately 45 families would have the birth order B G B B B B.
