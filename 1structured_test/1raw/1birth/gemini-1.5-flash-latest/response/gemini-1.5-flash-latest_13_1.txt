{answer: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming the probability of having a boy or girl is equal (50/50), each possible birth order sequence has an equal chance of occurring.
* **One Sequence:**  There's only one sequence with six boys: B G B B B B.
* **Estimate:** Since one sequence out of the many possible sequences was observed 45 times, we can estimate that the sequence B G B B B B would also occur approximately 45 times.  However, it's highly unlikely that any family had exactly this birth order in the survey. 

**Important Note:** This is a very simplistic estimate. In reality, factors like genetics and family history can influence the probability of having a boy or girl, and the sample size is likely too small for a reliable estimate.
