{answer: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming there's an equal chance of a boy or girl being born, each possible birth order sequence is equally likely. 
* **Matching Patterns:** The sequence B G B B B B has the same number of boys and girls as G B G B B G. 
* **Estimate:**  Since we know 45 families had the G B G B B G sequence, we can estimate that roughly the same number would have the B G B B B B sequence.

**Important Note:** This is an estimate based on the assumption of equal probability for boys and girls. Real-world birth patterns can be slightly more complex.
