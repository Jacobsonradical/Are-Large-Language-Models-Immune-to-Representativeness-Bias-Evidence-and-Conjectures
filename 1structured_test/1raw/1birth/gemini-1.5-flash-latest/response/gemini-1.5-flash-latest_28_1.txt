{answer: 45}

Here's why:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming there's an equal chance of having a boy or girl at each birth, every possible birth order sequence has an equal probability of occurring. 
* **Identical Probability:**  The sequence G B G B B G and B G B B B B have the same number of boys and girls, so they have the same probability of occurring.

Therefore, if 45 families had the first sequence, we would expect around 45 families to have the second sequence as well.
