{answer: 1}

Here's why:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50), each possible birth order sequence has an equal chance of occurring. 
* **One Sequence:**  There is only one possible birth order sequence for "B G B B B B."
* **Estimation:** Since the survey found 45 families with one specific sequence, and there are many other possible birth order sequences, it's reasonable to assume only a single family would have the sequence "B G B B B B."
