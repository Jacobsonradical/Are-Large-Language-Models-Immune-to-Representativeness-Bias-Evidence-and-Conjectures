Here's how to think about this problem:

* **Assumptions:** We're assuming that the sex of each child is independent of the others (having a boy or girl doesn't influence the sex of the next child). 
* **Probability:**  The probability of having a boy or girl is approximately 1/2.
* **Equal Probability:** Each possible birth order sequence has an equal probability of occurring.

**The Problem:** We're given that 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G. We need to estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B. 

**Solution:**

Since each birth order is equally likely, we can estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B by:

1. **Finding the total number of possible birth order combinations:** There are 2 possibilities for each child (boy or girl), and we have 6 children, so there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders. 
2. **Estimating the number of families with B G B B B B:**  Since each birth order is equally likely, we would expect approximately the same number of families for each of the 64 possible orders.  

**Therefore, we can estimate that roughly 45 families would have the birth order B G B B B B as well.**

**{answer: 45}**
