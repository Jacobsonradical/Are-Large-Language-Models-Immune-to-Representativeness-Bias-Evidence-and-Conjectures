Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with probabilities and assuming that the birth of a boy or girl is equally likely.  The key is that the order of births matters.

**Calculating the Probability**

* Each child has a 1/2 chance of being a boy or a girl.
*  For the order G B G B B G, the probability is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64

* Similarly, the probability of the order B G B B B B is also 1/64.

**Estimating the Total Number of Families**

Since the probability of each specific order is 1/64, and we know 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:

*  If 45 families represent 1/64 of the total, then the total number of families is approximately 45 * 64 = 2880

**Answer**

{answer: 2880}
