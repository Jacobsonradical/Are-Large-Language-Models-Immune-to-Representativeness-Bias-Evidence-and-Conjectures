Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We're dealing with probability and assuming that the birth of a boy or girl is equally likely (a 50/50 chance).  The fact that 45 families had a specific birth order gives us some information about the overall probability of that order.

**Estimating the Probability:**

* **Probability of G B G B B G:**  The probability of each individual birth order is 1/2 (either boy or girl). So, the probability of this specific sequence is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64.

* **Using the Sample:** Since 45 families out of the total surveyed had this order, it suggests that the total number of families surveyed might be a multiple of 64.

**Estimating the Number of Families:**

* **Simple Estimate:** A simple estimate would be to assume the 45 families represent a significant portion of all families with that order. We could multiply 45 by 64 to get an estimate of the total families: 45 * 64 = 2880 families. 

**Estimating the Number with B G B B B B:**

* **Equal Probability:**  Assuming each birth order is equally likely, the probability of B G B B B B is also 1/64. 

* **Estimate:**  Therefore, we could expect approximately the same number of families with this order as the one we were given. Our estimate would be around **45 families**.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45} 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate. The actual number of families surveyed could be higher or lower, and there's no guarantee that the distribution of birth orders is perfectly uniform.
