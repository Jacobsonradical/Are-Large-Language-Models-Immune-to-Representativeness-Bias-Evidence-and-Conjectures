Here's how to think about this problem:

* **Equal Probability:**  Assuming there's an equal chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth, every possible birth order of 6 children has the same probability.
* **Many Possibilities:** There are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders (boy or girl for each of the 6 children).
* **One Observed Order:** We know one specific order (G B G B B G) was observed in 45 families.
* **Estimating Other Orders:**  To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can use the proportion:

(Number of families with B G B B B B) / (Total number of families) ≈ (Number of families with G B G B B G) / (Total number of families)

Since we know 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate:

(Number of families with B G B B B B) ≈ (45 families) * (1 / 64) ≈ 0.7 families

**However, we can't have fractions of families.**  Since we're dealing with whole families, we'll round our estimate to the nearest whole number:

**{answer: 1}**
