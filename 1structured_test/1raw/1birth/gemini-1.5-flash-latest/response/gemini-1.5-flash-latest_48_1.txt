{answer: 45} 

Here's why:

We're assuming that the order of births is random. Since each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl, each possible birth order is equally likely.  Therefore, if there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we would expect the same number of families with the order B G B B B B.
