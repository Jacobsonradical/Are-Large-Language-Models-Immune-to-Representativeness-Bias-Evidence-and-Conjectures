{answer: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Probability:** Assuming an equal chance of having a boy or girl, each specific birth order has a probability of (1/2)^6 = 1/64.
* **Equal Probability:** The order G B G B B G is just as likely as the order B G B B B B.
* **Estimation:** Since 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately 1 family had the order B G B B B B. 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate based on the assumption of equal probability. Real-world birth patterns might deviate slightly from this.
