{answer: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Assuming equal probability:** We assume that each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl, and the gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the others. 
* **Independent events:** Each birth is an independent event.
* **Probability calculation:**  The probability of having a child of a specific gender is 1/2. Therefore, the probability of having a specific birth order of 6 children (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64. 
* **Estimate:** If 45 families have the birth order G B G B B G, which represents 1/64 of the total families, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as 45 * 64 = 2880.  Therefore, the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be (1/64) * 2880 = **2**.
