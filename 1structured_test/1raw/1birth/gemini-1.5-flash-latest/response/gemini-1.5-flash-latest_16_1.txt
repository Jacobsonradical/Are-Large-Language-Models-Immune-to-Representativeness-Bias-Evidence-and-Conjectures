{answer: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Assuming equal probability:** We're assuming that each possible birth order (like GBBGBG or BGBBBBB) is equally likely.
* **Many birth orders:** There are many different possible birth orders for six children. Each order has a 1 in 2 chance of being a boy or a girl.
* **Rare occurrence:** The order GBBGBG is one specific order out of many.  It's likely that a similar number of families would have the equally specific order BGBBBBB.

Since 45 families had GBBGBG, we can estimate that roughly 1 family had BGBBBBB.  

**Important Note:** This is a very rough estimate.  The actual number of families with BGBBBBB could be slightly more or less than 1.
