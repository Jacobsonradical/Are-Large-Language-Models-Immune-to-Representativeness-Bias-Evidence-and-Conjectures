Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Assumptions:** We're assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50%). This is a simplification, but it's a reasonable starting point.
* **Probability:** The probability of having a specific birth order like G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.
* **Estimation:**  Since 45 families out of the total surveyed had the order G B G B B G,  we can estimate the total number of families by assuming this represents 1/64 of the total.
* **Calculation:** To find the estimated total, multiply the number of families with the specific birth order by 64: 45 * 64 = 2880

**{answer: 2880}**
