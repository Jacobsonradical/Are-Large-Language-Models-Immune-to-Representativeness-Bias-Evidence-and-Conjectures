{answer: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Probability:** Assuming the probability of having a boy or girl is equal (50/50), each birth order sequence has an equal chance of occurring.
* **Equal Chance:** This means the order G B G B B G is just as likely as B G B B B B.
* **Estimate:** Since we know 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, it's reasonable to estimate that approximately **1 family** would have had the sequence B G B B B B.

**Important Note:** This is a very rough estimate.  The actual number of families with the order B G B B B B could be higher or lower than 1.
