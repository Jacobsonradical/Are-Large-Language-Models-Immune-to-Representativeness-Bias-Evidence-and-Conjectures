Here's how to think about this problem:

* **Assumptions:** We're assuming that the sex of each child is independent of the sex of the other children. In other words, having a boy or a girl in one birth doesn't affect the chances of having a boy or a girl in subsequent births.
* **Probability:**  Each birth has a roughly equal chance of being a boy or a girl.  Therefore, any specific order of six births has a probability of (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.

**Estimate:**

Since the order G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:

*  If 45 families represent one specific order (1/64 probability), then we can estimate the total number of families by multiplying by 64.
*  Estimated total families: 45 * 64 = 2880

**The probability of the order B G B B B B is the same as any other specific order (1/64).**

**Answer:** {answer: 45}
