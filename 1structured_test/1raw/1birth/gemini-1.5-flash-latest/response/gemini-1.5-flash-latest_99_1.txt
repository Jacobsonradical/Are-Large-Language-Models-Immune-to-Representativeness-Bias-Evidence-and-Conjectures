Here's how to think about this problem:

* **Each birth is independent:**  The gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next. 
* **Equal probability:** We assume there's a 50/50 chance of a boy or a girl for each birth.

Since each birth is independent and has equal probability, every possible birth order (like G B G B B G, B G B B B B, etc.) is equally likely.

**Therefore, our estimate is that the number of families with the order B G B B B B is approximately the same as the number with the order G B G B B G.**

**{answer: 45}**
