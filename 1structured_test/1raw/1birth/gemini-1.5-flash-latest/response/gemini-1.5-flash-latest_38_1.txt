Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with probability and assuming that the birth of a boy or girl is equally likely (a 50/50 chance).  The key is that we're looking at the *exact* order of births.

**Calculations**

* **Probability of G B G B B G:**  The probability of this specific sequence is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64.
* **Probability of B G B B B B:**  This sequence also has a probability of 1/64.
* **Estimating the Total Number of Families:**  Since the probability of each sequence is the same, we can assume that the number of families with each sequence should be roughly equal. Therefore, we would estimate that there are approximately **45 families** with the sequence B G B B B B.

**Answer:**
{answer: 45}
