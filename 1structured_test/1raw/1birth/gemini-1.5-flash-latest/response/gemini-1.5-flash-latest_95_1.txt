{answer: 1/64} 

Here's why:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming that the probability of having a boy or girl is equal (50%), each possible birth order sequence has an equal chance of occurring.
* **Calculating the Estimate:** There are 2 possible outcomes for each birth (boy or girl), and there are 6 births in a family of 6 children. This gives us 2^6 = 64 possible birth order combinations. Since each combination has an equal chance, we can estimate that approximately 1 out of 64 families would have the order B G B B B B.
