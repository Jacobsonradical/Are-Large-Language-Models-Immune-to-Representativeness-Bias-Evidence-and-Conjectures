{answer: 45} 

Here's why:

Assuming that each birth has an equal probability of being a boy or a girl, and that the births are independent events, each possible birth order sequence has the same probability.  

Therefore, if 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we would expect an equal number of families to have the sequence B G B B B B.
