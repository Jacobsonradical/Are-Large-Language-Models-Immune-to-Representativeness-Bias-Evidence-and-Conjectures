{answer: 45} 

Here's why:

The question states that the exact order of births was considered in the survey. This implies that each possible birth order combination is equally likely.  

Therefore, if 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can reasonably estimate that the same number of families would have the order B G B B B B, as both are specific sequences with the same probability.
