Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Assumptions:** We assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50%) and that each birth is independent of the others.
* **Probability of a Specific Order:** The probability of having a specific birth order like G B G B B G is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.  
* **Estimating the Total Number of Families:**  Since 45 families had the specific order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by:

   (Total Families) * (Probability of G B G B B G) = 45

   Total Families = 45 / (1/64) = 2880

* **Estimating the Number with B G B B B B:** The probability of having the order B G B B B B is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64.  We can estimate the number of families with this order by:

   (Total Families) * (Probability of B G B B B B) = 2880 * (1/64) = 45

**Answer:** {answer: 45}
