Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with probability and assuming that the sex of each child is independent of the others (meaning having a boy or girl doesn't influence the sex of subsequent children).

**Assumptions**

* **Equal Probability:** We'll assume there's a 50/50 chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth. 
* **Randomness:** We'll assume the births are random events.

**Calculating the Probability**

* **Probability of G B G B B G:** The probability of getting this specific sequence is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64
* **Probability of B G B B B B:**  The probability of this sequence is also 1/64.

**Estimating the Number of Families**

Since the probabilities of both sequences are equal, we can estimate that approximately the same number of families would have the sequence B G B B B B.
