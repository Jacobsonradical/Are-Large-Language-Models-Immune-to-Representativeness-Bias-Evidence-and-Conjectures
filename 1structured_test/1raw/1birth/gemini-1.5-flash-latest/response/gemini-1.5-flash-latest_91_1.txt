Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* We're dealing with probabilities and assuming that the sex of each child is independent of the others (meaning a girl being born doesn't affect the probability of the next child being a girl or a boy).
* We're given a specific birth order that occurred in 45 families out of a larger unknown number.
* We want to estimate how many families out of that unknown total would have a different specific birth order.

**Assumptions**

* We'll assume a 50/50 chance for each child being a boy or a girl.

**Calculation**

1. **Probability of the given birth order:**  The probability of getting G B G B B G is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64 (since there's a 1/2 chance for each birth).

2. **Probability of the target birth order:**  The probability of getting B G B B B B is also (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.

3. **Estimating the total number of families:**  Since the probabilities of both birth orders are equal, we can assume that the number of families with each order should be roughly the same.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45} 

**Explanation:**

Since the probability of the target birth order is the same as the given birth order, we would expect approximately the same number of families to have that order.
