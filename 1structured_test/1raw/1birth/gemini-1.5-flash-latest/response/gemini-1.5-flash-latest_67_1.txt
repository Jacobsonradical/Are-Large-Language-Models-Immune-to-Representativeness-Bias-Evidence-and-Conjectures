{answer: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming there's an equal chance of having a boy or a girl, each possible birth order sequence has an equal probability of occurring.
* **Unique Sequences:**  The sequence G B G B B G is just one of many possible sequences. 
* **Limited Data:** We only have data from 45 families with that specific sequence. This doesn't give us enough information to determine how many families had other sequences.

Therefore, the best estimate for the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B is **1**, assuming the probability of each sequence is equal.
