{answer: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming there's no bias towards boys or girls, each possible birth order sequence has an equal probability of occurring.
* **One Order:** There is only one possible order for B G B B B B.
* **Estimate:** Since 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately 1 family would have the order B G B B B B. 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on the limited data. In reality, the actual number of families with that specific birth order could be slightly different.
