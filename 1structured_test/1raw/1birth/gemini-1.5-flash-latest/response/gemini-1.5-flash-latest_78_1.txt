Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* We're dealing with probabilities related to coin flips (boy or girl).  
* Each child's birth is independent of the others (the gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next).

**Estimating the Probability**

* **Probability of G B G B B G:**  Since each birth has a 50/50 chance of being a boy or girl, the probability of this specific order is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64
* **Probability of B G B B B B:** This order has the same probability as the previous one: 1/64

**Estimating the Number of Families**

* **Ratio:** Since the two orders have the same probability, we expect to find approximately the same number of families with each order. 
* **Estimation:**  If 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that roughly 45 families would also have the order B G B B B B.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
