Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with probabilities and assuming births are independent events (the gender of one child doesn't affect the gender of the next). Each birth has a 50/50 chance of being a boy or a girl.

**The Logic**

* The order "G B G B B G" is just one specific arrangement of 3 boys and 3 girls.
* Any other arrangement of 3 boys and 3 girls is equally likely.
* To estimate the number of families with "B G B B B B", we need to consider how many arrangements of 6 children with 6 boys are possible.

**Calculation**

* There's only **one** arrangement of 6 children with all boys: B B B B B B

**Estimate**

Since there's only one arrangement of 6 boys, and the order "G B G B B G" is just one out of many equally likely arrangements of 3 boys and 3 girls, we can estimate that the number of families with "B G B B B B" is significantly lower than the 45 families observed with "G B G B B G".  

**Answer**

{answer: significantly less than 45} 

**Important Note:** We cannot give an exact number without knowing the total number of families surveyed.
