{answer: 45} 

Here's why:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming that having a boy or a girl is equally likely, each possible birth order sequence has an equal chance of occurring.
* **Independence:**  The gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the subsequent children.

Therefore, if 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately 45 families would also have the order B G B B B B.
