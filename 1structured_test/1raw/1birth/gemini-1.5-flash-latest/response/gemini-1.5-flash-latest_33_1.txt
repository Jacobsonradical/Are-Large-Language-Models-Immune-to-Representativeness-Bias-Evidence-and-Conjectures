Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with probabilities and assuming that the birth of a boy or girl is equally likely.  The problem doesn't state that the families were selected randomly, so we can't be absolutely sure about the number of families surveyed.  However, we can make an educated estimate.

**Assumptions and Logic**

* **Equal Probability:** We assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is 50% (0.5). 
* **Independence:** We assume that the sex of each child is independent of the others. This means the sex of one child doesn't influence the sex of the next.

**Calculation**

* **Probability of G B G B B G:**  The probability of this specific birth order is (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) = (0.5)^6 = 1/64.
* **Probability of B G B B B B:** The probability of this specific birth order is also (0.5)^6 = 1/64.

**Estimating the Number of Families**

Since the probabilities are equal, we can assume that the number of families with each birth order should be roughly the same if the sample is large enough.  

**Estimate:** 

Since 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately **45 families** would have the order B G B B B B.

**Answer:**
{answer: 45}
