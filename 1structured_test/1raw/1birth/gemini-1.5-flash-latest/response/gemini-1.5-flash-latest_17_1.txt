Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* We're assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50).
* The order of births is important (e.g., GGBBGB is different from BGBGBG).

**Calculations:**

* **Probability of a specific birth order:**  The probability of getting a specific order of 6 births (like G B G B B G) is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.
* **Estimate of families surveyed:** If 45 families had the specific order G B G B B G, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by: 45 families * 64 = **2880 families**

**Answer:**

{answer: 2880}
