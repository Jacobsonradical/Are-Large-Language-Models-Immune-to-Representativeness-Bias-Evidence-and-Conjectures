{answer:  45} 

Here's why:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming that the probability of having a boy or girl is equal (50/50), each possible birth order is equally likely. 
* **No Bias:**  There's no reason to believe that one birth order is more or less common than another.
* **Estimation:**  Since we know 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that the same number of families would have the order B G B B B B.
