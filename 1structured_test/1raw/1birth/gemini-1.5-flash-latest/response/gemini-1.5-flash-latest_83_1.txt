Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* We're dealing with probabilities and assuming the probability of having a boy or girl is equal (50/50).
* The specific order of births matters.
* We're given the frequency of one specific order (GBGBBG) and need to estimate the frequency of another (BGBBBBB).

**Solution:**

1. **Probability of each order:** Since each child has an equal chance of being a boy or girl, the probability of any specific order of six births is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.

2. **Comparing orders:** The orders GBGBBG and BGBBBBB are equally likely because each has six specific birth outcomes.

3. **Estimating the total number of families:** Since 45 families had the order GBGBBG, and this represents 1/64 of all possible orders, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as:

   45 families * 64 = **2880 families**

**Answer:** {answer: 2880}
