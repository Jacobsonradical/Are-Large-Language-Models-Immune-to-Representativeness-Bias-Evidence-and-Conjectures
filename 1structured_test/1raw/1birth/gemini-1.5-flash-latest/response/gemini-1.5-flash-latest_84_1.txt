{answer: 0} 

Here's why:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming there's an equal chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth, every possible birth order combination has the same probability of occurring. 
* **Unique Order:** The order B G B B B B is distinct from G B G B B G.
* **No Correlation:**  The fact that one specific order was observed 45 times doesn't influence the probability of any other specific order occurring.

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the number of families with the order B G B B B B would be extremely low, likely close to zero.
