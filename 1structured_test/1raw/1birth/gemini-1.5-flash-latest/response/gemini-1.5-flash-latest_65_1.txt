Here's how we can estimate the answer:

* **Understanding the Problem:** The problem assumes that the probability of having a boy or girl is equal (50/50 chance). In reality, this isn't always true, but it's a simplifying assumption for this problem. 

* **Equal Probability:**  If the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, then each possible birth order sequence has an equal chance of occurring.

* **Estimating:**  Since there are 2 possible outcomes (boy or girl) for each birth, and there are 6 births, there are a total of 2^6 = 64 possible birth order sequences.

* **Calculation:**  We know 45 families out of a total number had the specific sequence G B G B B G. This represents 45/64 of the possible sequences. To estimate the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B, we can assume a similar proportion:

   (45 families / 64 possible sequences) = (x families / 64 possible sequences)

   Solving for x, we get: x = 45 families

**Answer: {answer: 45}**

**Important Note:** This is an estimate based on the assumption of equal probability for boys and girls.  In reality, the actual number of families with the sequence B G B B B B could be slightly different.
