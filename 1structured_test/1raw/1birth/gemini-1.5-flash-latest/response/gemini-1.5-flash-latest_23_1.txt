{answer: 1} 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming there's an equal chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth, every possible birth order has the same probability of occurring.
* **One Order:** There's only one possible order for B G B B B B.
* **Estimate:** Since 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately 1 family would have the order B G B B B B. 

It's important to note this is just an estimate. The actual number of families with this specific birth order could be slightly higher or lower due to random chance.
