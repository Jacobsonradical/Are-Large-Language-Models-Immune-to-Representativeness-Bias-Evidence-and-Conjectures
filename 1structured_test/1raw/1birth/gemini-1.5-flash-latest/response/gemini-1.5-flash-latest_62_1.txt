{answer: 1}

Here's why:

* **Probability of a Specific Order:** Each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl (assuming a 50/50 probability).  So, for a family of 6 children, there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth order combinations.
* **Equal Likelihood:**  All birth orders are equally likely. Since we know one specific order (G B G B B G) occurred in 45 families, we can assume that any other specific order would also have occurred in approximately 45 families. 
* **Estimate:**  Therefore, it's reasonable to estimate that roughly 45 families would have had the birth order B G B B B B. However, since we are dealing with whole families, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1.
