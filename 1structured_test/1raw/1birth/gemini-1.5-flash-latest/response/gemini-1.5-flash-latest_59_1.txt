Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with probabilities and assuming that the sex of each child is independent of the others (meaning having a boy or girl doesn't affect the sex of the next child). 

**Calculating the Probability**

* The probability of having a girl is 1/2.
* The probability of having a boy is 1/2.

To get the probability of a specific order, we multiply the probabilities together:

*  Probability of G B G B B G = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64

*  Probability of B G B B B B = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64

**Estimating the Number of Families**

Since both sequences have the same probability (1/64), we can estimate that the number of families with the order B G B B B B would be roughly the same as the number with G B G B B G.
