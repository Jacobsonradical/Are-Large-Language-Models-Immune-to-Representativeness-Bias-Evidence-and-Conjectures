{answer: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Probability:** Assuming an equal chance of having a boy or girl, each specific birth order sequence has an equal probability. 
* **Equal Probability:**  This means the sequence G B G B B G is just as likely as B G B B B B.
* **Estimate:** Since 45 families had the G B G B B G order, we can estimate that roughly 45 families would also have the B G B B B B order. However, since we are dealing with a small sample size and a specific sequence, it is more likely that there will be only 1 or 2 families with this order. 

It's important to note that this is an estimate, and the actual number could be slightly different.
