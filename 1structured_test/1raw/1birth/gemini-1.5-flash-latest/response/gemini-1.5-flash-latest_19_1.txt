Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Concept**

The order of births of boys and girls is a random event.  Each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl.  Therefore, every possible birth order sequence is equally likely.

**Estimating the Number of Families**

Since all birth order sequences are equally likely:

* The number of families with the sequence G B G B B G should be roughly the same as the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B.

**Answer**
