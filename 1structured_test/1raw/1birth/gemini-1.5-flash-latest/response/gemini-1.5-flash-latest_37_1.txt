Here's how to approach this problem and get an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

The key is that we're dealing with *exact* birth orders.  This means each birth order is equally likely. 

**Reasoning**

* There are 2 possible outcomes for each birth (boy or girl).
* For a family of 6 children, there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders.
* We're given that 45 families had the order G B G B B G. This represents one specific birth order out of 64.

**Estimate**

Since each birth order is equally likely, we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would also be approximately 45.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
