Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* We're dealing with probabilities related to birth order. 
* We assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50).
* We're looking for an estimate, not an exact number.

**Calculations**

1. **Probability of a Specific Order:**  The probability of having a specific order of 6 births (like G B G B B G) is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64. This is because each birth has a 1/2 chance of being a boy or a girl.

2. **Estimating the Total Number of Families:**
   * If 45 families had the order G B G B B G, and this order has a probability of 1/64, we can estimate that there were approximately 45 * 64 = 2880 families surveyed.

3. **Estimating the Number with B G B B B B:**
   *  The order B G B B B B has the same probability of occurring as G B G B B G (1/64).
   *  Therefore, we would estimate that approximately 45 families would have this order.

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
