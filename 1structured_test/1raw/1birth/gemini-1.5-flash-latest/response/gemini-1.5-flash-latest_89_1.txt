{answer: 1}

**Explanation:**

Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50%), each birth sequence is equally likely.  Since there were 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate that there would be roughly the same number of families with any other specific sequence, including B G B B B B.  

However, it is important to note that this is just an estimate. Real-world factors, such as family planning decisions or genetic predispositions, could influence the actual number of families with this specific sequence.
