{answer: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Assumptions:** We're assuming that the order of births is random (i.e., there's no biological or environmental factor that would bias the order of boys and girls).
* **Probability:** With a random birth order, each possible combination of six children (like GBBGBG or BBBBBB) has an equal probability of occurring.
* **Estimation:** Since we saw 45 families with the order GBBGBG, and this is just one specific order, we can estimate that there's likely only **one** family with the order BBBBBB. 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate. In reality, the number of families with the order BBBBBB could be slightly higher or lower than one.
