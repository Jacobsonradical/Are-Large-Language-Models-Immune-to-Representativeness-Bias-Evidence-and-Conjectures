Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're assuming that each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl. This means each birth order sequence has an equal probability of occurring.

**The Logic**

* The sequence G B G B B G has a specific order.  
* The sequence B G B B B B also has a specific order.
* Since each birth order is equally likely, we'd expect roughly the same number of families to have each specific order.

**Estimate**

Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the sequence B G B B B B would also be **45**.

**Answer:** {answer: 45}
