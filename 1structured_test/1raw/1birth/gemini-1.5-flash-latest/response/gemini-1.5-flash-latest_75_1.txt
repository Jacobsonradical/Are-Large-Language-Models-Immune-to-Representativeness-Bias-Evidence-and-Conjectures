{answer: 45} 

Here's why:

* **Assuming equal probability:** We're assuming that each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl, and the gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the others.
* **Independent events:** Each birth is an independent event, meaning the outcome of one birth doesn't affect the others. 

Since the probability of each birth order is equally likely (assuming equal probability of boy or girl for each birth), we can estimate that the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B would be approximately the same as the number of families with the birth order G B G B B G.
