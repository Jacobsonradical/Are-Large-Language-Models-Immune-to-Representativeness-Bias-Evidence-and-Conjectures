{answer: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Probability:** Each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl, assuming a 50/50 probability. 
* **Independent Events:**  The sex of each child is independent of the others.  So, the order of births (like GBBGBG) is just one specific arrangement among many possible arrangements. 
* **Equal Likelihood:**  Any specific arrangement of six births (like BBBB BB) is equally likely as GBBGBG.

Since we know 45 families had the order GBBGBG, it's reasonable to assume that roughly the same number of families would have the order BBBB BB. However, it's likely that there will be some variation due to random chance.  

Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the number of families with BBBB BB is **1**.
