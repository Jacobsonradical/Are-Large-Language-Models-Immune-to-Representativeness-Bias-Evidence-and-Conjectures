Here's how we can approach this problem:

* **Assume equal probability:** We'll assume that each possible birth order (BBBBB, BGBGB, etc.) has an equal probability of occurring.
* **Possible birth orders:** There are 2 possible outcomes for each child (B or G), and we have 6 children. So, there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders.
* **One out of 64:** Since each order is equally likely, the order GBGBBG represents 1 out of the 64 possible orders.
* **Estimate the total:** If 45 families represent 1 out of 64 possible orders, then we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as 45 * 64 = 2880.

**Therefore, our estimate is:** 
{answer: 2880}
