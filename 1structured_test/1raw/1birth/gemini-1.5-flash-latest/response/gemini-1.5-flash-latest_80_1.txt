{answer: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50), each possible birth order sequence has an equal chance of occurring. 
* **One Specific Order:** The order G B G B B G is just one specific sequence out of many possible birth order combinations for six children.
* **Estimate:** Since we are assuming all birth orders are equally likely, we would expect roughly the same number of families for each specific order. Therefore, if 45 families had the order G B G B B G, we would estimate that approximately **1 family** would have the order B G B B B B.

**Important Note:** This is a very rough estimate. Real-world birth patterns are influenced by factors like genetics and environmental influences, and the actual number of families with the order B G B B B B might vary.
