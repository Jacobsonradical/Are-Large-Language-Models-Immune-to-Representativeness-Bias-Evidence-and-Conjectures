{answer: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Assuming equal probability:** We assume that each possible birth order is equally likely (this is a simplification, as real-life birth order probabilities can be slightly influenced by factors like genetics). 
* **Total possible birth orders:** With six children, there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders (each child can be either a boy or a girl).
* **Estimate:** Since we know 45 families had one specific order, we can estimate that roughly 1/64 of the families surveyed had each specific order.  Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the order B G B B B B is: (1/64) * 45 â‰ˆ 0.7.

Since we can't have a fraction of a family, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1.
