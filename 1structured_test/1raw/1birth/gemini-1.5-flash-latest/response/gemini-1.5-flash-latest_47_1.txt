{answer: 1}

Here's why:

* **Equal Probability:**  Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50), each possible birth order sequence is equally likely. 
* **One Sequence:** There's only one possible birth order sequence for B G B B B B. 
* **Estimation:** Since 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately 1 family would have the sequence B G B B B B.

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on the assumption of equal probabilities.  Real-world birth order patterns can be influenced by factors like genetics and environmental conditions.
