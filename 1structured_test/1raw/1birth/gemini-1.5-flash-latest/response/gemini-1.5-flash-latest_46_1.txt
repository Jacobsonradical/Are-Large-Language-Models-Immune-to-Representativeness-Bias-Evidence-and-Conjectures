{answer: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50), each possible birth order sequence for six children is equally likely.
* **One Sequence:** There's only one possible sequence for B G B B B B.
* **Estimation:** Since we observed one sequence (G B G B B G) in 45 families, we can estimate that there's likely one family with the sequence B G B B B B. 

**Important Note:** This is a very rough estimate. Real-world birth patterns can be influenced by factors like genetics and environmental factors, making this a simplified model.
