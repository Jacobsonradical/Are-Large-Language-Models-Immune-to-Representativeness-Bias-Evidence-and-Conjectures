Here's how to approach this problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with probabilities and assuming that the birth of a boy or girl is equally likely (a 50/50 chance). We need to estimate how many families out of the total surveyed would have a specific birth order.

**Calculations**

* **Probability of G B G B B G:** The probability of this specific order is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.  This is because there are 6 births, and each has a 1/2 chance of being a boy or girl.

* **Estimate of Total Families:** If 45 families represent a 1/64 probability, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

   * Let 'x' be the total number of families surveyed.
   * (1/64) * x = 45
   * x = 45 * 64
   * x = 2880

* **Probability of B G B B B B:**  The probability of this birth order is also (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.

* **Estimated Number of Families with B G B B B B:** Since the probability is the same, we can expect about the same number of families to have this birth order:

    * (1/64) * 2880 = 45

**Answer:**

{answer: 45}
