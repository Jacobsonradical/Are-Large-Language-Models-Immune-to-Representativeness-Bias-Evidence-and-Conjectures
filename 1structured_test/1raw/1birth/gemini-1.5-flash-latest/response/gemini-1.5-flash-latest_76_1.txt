{answer: 1} 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming there's an equal chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth, every possible birth order (like GBBGBG, BGBBBB, etc.) is equally likely.
* **One Specific Order:**  The survey found 45 families with the specific order GBBGBG out of all possible families of six children. This tells us that one specific order occurred 45 times. 
* **Estimating the Other Order:** Since all orders are equally likely, we can estimate that the order BGBBBB would also occur approximately 45 times. However, since we are only considering families of six children, and we already know 45 families have the order GBBGBG, we can only estimate that **one** family would have the order BGBBBB.
