{answer: 0} 

Here's why:

The probability of any specific birth order (like G B G B B G) is extremely low.  Since the survey found 45 families with this exact order, it's highly likely that the survey captured a significant portion of all families with six children in the city.  

Therefore, it's very unlikely that any families in the city would have the order B G B B B B.
