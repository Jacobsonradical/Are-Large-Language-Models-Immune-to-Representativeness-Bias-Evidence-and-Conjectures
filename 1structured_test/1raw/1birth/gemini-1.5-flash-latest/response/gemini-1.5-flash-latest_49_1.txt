Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

The question is asking us to estimate the number of families with a specific birth order (all boys) based on the frequency of another specific birth order (G B G B B G).  We're assuming that the probability of having a boy or girl is equal (50/50) and that births are independent events.

**Key Assumption:**

We are assuming that the birth order of children within families is random.  This is a simplification, as there are some biological factors that could influence the likelihood of having a boy or girl.

**Estimation:**

* **Probability of G B G B B G:** The probability of this specific birth order is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.
* **Probability of B G B B B B:**  The probability of this specific birth order is also (1/2)^6 = 1/64.

Since both birth orders have the same probability, we can use the observed frequency of one to estimate the frequency of the other.

**Calculation:**

* We know 45 families had the order G B G B B G.
* This represents 45/(1/64) = 2880 families in total (based on our assumption of random birth order).

**Estimate:**

* Therefore, we would estimate that approximately **2880** families were surveyed.

**Answer:** {answer: 2880}
