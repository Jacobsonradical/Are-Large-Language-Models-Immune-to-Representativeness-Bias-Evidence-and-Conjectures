{answer: 0}

Here's why:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming the chance of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50), each possible birth order sequence has the same probability. 
* **Unique Order:** The order "B G B B B B" is a distinct and unique sequence.
* **No Evidence:**  The survey data only provides information about one specific birth order ("G B G B B G"). It tells us nothing about the frequency of other birth orders.

Therefore, we have no basis to estimate the number of families with the birth order "B G B B B B".  It's likely that there are very few or even zero families with this exact birth order.
