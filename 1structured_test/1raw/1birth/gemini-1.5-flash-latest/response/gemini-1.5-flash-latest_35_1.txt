Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

The key is to realize that assuming births are equally likely to be boys or girls, each possible birth order is equally likely.

**The Logic**

* There are 2 possible outcomes for each birth (boy or girl).
* With 6 children, there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders.
*  Since all birth orders are equally likely, we expect each order to occur about the same number of times.

**Calculation**

* We know 45 families out of the total surveyed had the birth order G B G B B G.
* Since there are 64 possible birth orders, we can estimate that the total number of families surveyed is approximately 64 times the number with the specific order G B G B B G.

**Answer**

{answer: 64 * 45 = 2880}
