Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem is asking us to estimate the number of families with a specific birth order (B G B B B B) based on the number of families with a different specific birth order (G B G B B G). 

**Key Assumption**

We need to assume that each birth order (sequence of boys and girls) is equally likely. This is a simplifying assumption and may not perfectly reflect real-world birth patterns.

**Calculations**

* **Possible Birth Orders:**  There are 2 possible outcomes for each birth (boy or girl), and we have 6 children. This means there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders.
* **Proportion:**  We know 45 families out of the total had the specific birth order G B G B B G. This represents 45/64 of the total families.
* **Estimate:**  Since we're assuming all birth orders are equally likely, the proportion of families with the birth order B G B B B B would also be 45/64. 

**Estimate:** To find the estimated number of families with the birth order B G B B B B, we can set up a proportion:

(45/64) = (x / total families)

We don't know the total number of families surveyed, so we can't solve for an exact number. However, we can estimate.  Let's assume the total number of families was 100.  Then, we would have:

(45/64) = (x / 100)
x = (45/64) * 100 
x â‰ˆ 70.3

**Answer:**

Since we can't know the exact number of families surveyed, we can only provide an estimated range.  Based on our assumption of equal likelihood for each birth order, we can estimate that approximately **70 families** out of 100 surveyed would have the birth order B G B B B B.
