{answer:  approximately 1}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Assuming equal probability:**  We assume that each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl (a 50/50 probability).
* **Independent events:** We assume each birth is independent of the others â€“ the gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next.

With these assumptions, each possible birth order has the same probability.  

Since there were 45 families with the order G B G B B G, we can estimate that there would be approximately the same number of families with the order B G B B B B.  

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate based on probabilities. The actual number of families with that birth order could be slightly higher or lower due to random variation.
