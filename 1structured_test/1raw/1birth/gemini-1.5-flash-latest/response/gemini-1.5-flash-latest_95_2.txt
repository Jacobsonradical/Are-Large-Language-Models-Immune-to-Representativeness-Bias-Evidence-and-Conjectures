Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with probability and assuming that the sex of each child is independent of the others (a simplification, but a common one in these types of problems).

**The Key Insight**

The probability of any specific birth order (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is the same.  This is because each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl.

**Calculating the Estimate**

1. **Calculate the total number of possible birth orders:** There are two possibilities (B or G) for each of the six children, so there are 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders.

2. **Assume equal probability:**  Since each birth order is equally likely, the order G B G B B G represents 1/64 of all possible families.

3. **Estimate the total number of families:** If 45 families represent one specific birth order (1/64), we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by:

   45 families * (64 birth orders / 1 birth order) = 2880 families

**Answer:**

{answer: 2880}
