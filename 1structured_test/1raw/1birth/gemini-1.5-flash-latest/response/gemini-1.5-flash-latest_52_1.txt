{answer: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (which is a simplification, but a common assumption in these types of problems), each possible birth order sequence is equally likely.
* **One Sequence:** There's only one possible sequence for B G B B B B.
* **Same Probability:** The sequence G B G B B G has the same probability as B G B B B B.
* **Estimate:** Since 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately 1 family would have the sequence B G B B B B. 

This is a very rough estimate, as the actual number of families with that sequence could be slightly higher or lower.
