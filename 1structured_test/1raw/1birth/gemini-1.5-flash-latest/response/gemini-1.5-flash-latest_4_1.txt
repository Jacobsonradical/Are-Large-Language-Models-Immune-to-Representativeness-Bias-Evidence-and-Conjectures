Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Understanding the Problem:**  We're dealing with the probability of different birth order combinations. Since there are only two possibilities (B or G) for each child, we can think of this as a series of coin flips.
* **Equal Probability:** Assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (which is a simplification, but a common assumption in these types of problems), each birth order sequence is equally likely. 
* **Estimation:** Since the birth order G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we can estimate that any other specific birth order (like B G B B B B) would also occur in approximately 45 families.

**{answer: 45}**
