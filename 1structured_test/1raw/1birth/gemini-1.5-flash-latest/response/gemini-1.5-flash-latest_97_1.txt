Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with probabilities and the assumption that each child's gender is independent of the others (meaning having a boy or girl doesn't influence the gender of subsequent children).

**Calculating the Probability**

* **Probability of G B G B B G:**  The probability of having a girl, then a boy, then a girl, etc. is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^6 = 1/64.
* **Probability of B G B B B B:**  This sequence also has a probability of 1/64.

**Estimating the Total Number of Families**

Since the probability of each sequence is the same, we can assume that the number of families with each sequence is roughly proportional to the total number of families surveyed.

* Let 'x' be the total number of families surveyed.
* We know 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, which represents 1/64 of the total. 
* We can set up a proportion: (1/64) * x = 45
* Solving for x: x = 45 * 64 = 2880

**Estimate:**

{answer: 2880} 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate. The actual number of families with the sequence B G B B B B could be slightly higher or lower due to random variation.
