Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

The key is that each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl.  Since we're dealing with a specific order, we can treat each birth as an independent event.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Probability of G B G B B G:** The probability of each specific birth order is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.
* **Probability of B G B B B B:**  This has the same probability as any other specific order: 1/64.

**Estimating the Number of Families**

* We know 45 families had the order G B G B B G, which represents a probability of 1/64. 
* To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can assume the same probability applies. 
* Since the probability is the same, we'd expect roughly the same number of families with each order.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
