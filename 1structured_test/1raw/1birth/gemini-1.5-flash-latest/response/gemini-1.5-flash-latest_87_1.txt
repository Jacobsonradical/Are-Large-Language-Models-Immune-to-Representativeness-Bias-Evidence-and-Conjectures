Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We're dealing with probabilities and assuming that the gender of each child is independent of the others (meaning having a boy or girl doesn't affect the gender of the next child).  

**Estimating the Probability:**

* **Probability of G B G B B G:**  Each birth has a 1/2 chance of being a boy or a girl.  So the probability of this specific sequence is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64

* **Probability of B G B B B B:** This sequence has the same probability: 1/64

**Estimating the Number of Families:**

* **Ratio:** Since the probabilities are the same, we can assume that the number of families with each sequence should be roughly the same.
* **Estimate:** If 45 families had the G B G B B G sequence, we can estimate that approximately 45 families would have the B G B B B B sequence.

**Answer:**
{answer: 45}
