{answer: 1} 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Equal Probability:**  Assuming there's an equal chance of having a boy or a girl, each possible birth order sequence has the same probability. 
* **One Order:** There's only one possible way to have the sequence B G B B B B. 
* **Estimate:** Since 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate that about 1 family would have the sequence B G B B B B. This is a very rough estimate due to the small sample size.
