Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Understanding the problem:**  We're dealing with the probability of a specific sequence of births (B G B B B B) assuming that each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl.
* **Calculating the probability:**  The probability of a single sequence (like B G B B B B) is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.  This is because there are 2 possibilities for each birth (boy or girl), and we have 6 births.
* **Estimating the total number of families:**  Since we know 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, and this sequence also has a probability of 1/64, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed by multiplying the number of families with the specific sequence by the reciprocal of the probability:

  45 families * (64 / 1) = 2880 families

**Answer:** {answer: 2880}
