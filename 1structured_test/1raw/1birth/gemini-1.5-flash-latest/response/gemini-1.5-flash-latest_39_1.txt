{answer: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming there's an equal chance of having a boy or a girl for each birth, every possible birth order sequence has the same probability of occurring.
* **One Sequence:** There's only one way to have the sequence B G B B B B. 
* **Rare Occurrence:**  The sequence G B G B B G is likely to be rare, just like B G B B B B.

Since the survey found 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately 1 family would have the sequence B G B B B B.
