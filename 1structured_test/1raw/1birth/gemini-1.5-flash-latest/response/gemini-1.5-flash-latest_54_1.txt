Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

The key is to realize that each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl. This means each birth sequence is equally likely. 

**Estimating the Number of Families**

* **Equally Likely Sequences:** Since each birth is independent, the sequence G B G B B G is just as likely as the sequence B G B B B B.
* **Estimate:** If 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately 45 families would also have the sequence B G B B B B.

**Answer**

{answer: 45}
