{answer: 45}

Here's why:

Assuming there is no preference for boys or girls at birth, each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or girl.  This means each possible birth order sequence is equally likely.  

Since we know there were 45 families with the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume there were also 45 families with the sequence B G B B B B.
