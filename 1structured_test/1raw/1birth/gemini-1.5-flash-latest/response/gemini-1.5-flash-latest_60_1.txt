Here's how we can estimate:

* **Assumptions:** We're assuming that each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl, and that the gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the others. This is a simplification, but it's a reasonable starting point.
* **Probability:**  With equal chances, there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth order combinations for a family of six children.
* **The Pattern:** The pattern G B G B B G is just one out of these 64 possibilities. 
* **Estimation:** Since the pattern G B G B B G occurred in 45 families, we might expect other specific patterns to occur with similar frequency.

**Therefore, our estimate of the number of families with the pattern B G B B B B is also approximately 45.**

**{answer: 45}**
