{answer: 1}

Here's why:

* **Assuming equal probability:**  We assume that for each birth, there's a 50/50 chance of having a boy or a girl. This is a simplification, as birth rates can fluctuate slightly.
* **Independent events:** Each birth is considered independent of the others. The gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of subsequent children.

With this in mind, each possible birth order sequence (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) has an equal probability of occurring. 

Since 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately 1 family would have the sequence B G B B B B. 

**Important Note:** This is a rough estimate.  The actual number of families with that specific birth order could be slightly higher or lower due to random variation.
