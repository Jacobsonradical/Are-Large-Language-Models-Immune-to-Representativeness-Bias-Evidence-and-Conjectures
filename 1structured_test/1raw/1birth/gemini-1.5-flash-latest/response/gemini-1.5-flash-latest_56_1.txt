{answer: 1} 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming there's an equal chance of having a boy or girl, each birth order sequence has the same probability of occurring.
* **Rare Sequences:**  The sequence "G B G B B G" and "B G B B B B" are both highly specific and relatively rare compared to other possible birth order combinations. 
* **Estimate:** Since we know 45 families had the sequence "G B G B B G", it's reasonable to estimate that only about 1 family would have the sequence "B G B B B B". 

This is a rough estimate, but it's based on the idea that the probability of any specific birth order is low.
