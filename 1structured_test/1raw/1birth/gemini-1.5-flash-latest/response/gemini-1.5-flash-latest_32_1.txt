{answer: 1}

Here's the reasoning:

* **Assumptions:** We're assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50%) and that births are independent events.
* **Probability of a Specific Order:** The probability of any specific birth order (like G B G B B G) is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.
* **Estimate:** Since we know 45 families had the specific order G B G B B G, which has a 1/64 probability, we can estimate that there were about 45 * 64 = 2880 families surveyed.
* **Second Order:**  The probability of the order B G B B B B is also 1/64.  Therefore, we'd expect approximately 1 family out of the 2880 to have that order. 

**Important Note:** This is just an estimate. The actual number of families with the order B G B B B B could be slightly higher or lower due to chance.
