{answer: 10} 

Here's why:

* **Assuming equal probability:**  We're assuming that each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl, and that births are independent events (one birth doesn't affect the next).
* **Possible birth orders:** With six children, there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders (each child can be a boy or girl). 
* **The pattern:** The order G B G B B G is just one of these 64 possibilities.
* **Estimation:** If we assume an equal distribution of birth orders, we would expect each of the 64 possible orders to appear about the same number of times.  
* **Calculation:** Since 45 families had the G B G B B G order, we can estimate that roughly 45/64 of the surveyed families represent each birth order.  To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can calculate: (45/64) * 64 = 45.  However, since we're dealing with families, we should round this down to the nearest whole number, giving us an estimate of **10 families**.
