{answer: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Each birth is independent:**  The gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of the next.
* **Equal probability:**  Assuming a 50/50 chance of a boy or girl, each birth sequence has an equal probability of occurring.

Since the sequence G B G B B G is observed 45 times, it's likely that other equally probable sequences would occur about the same number of times. Therefore, we can estimate that about 1 family would have the sequence B G B B B B.
