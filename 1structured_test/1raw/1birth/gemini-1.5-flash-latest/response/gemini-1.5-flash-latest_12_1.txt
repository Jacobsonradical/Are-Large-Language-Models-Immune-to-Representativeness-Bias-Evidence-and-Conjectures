Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem is asking us to estimate the number of families with a specific birth order (BGBBB) based on the observed frequency of another birth order (GBGBBG). 

**Assumptions**

We need to make some key assumptions:

* **Equal Probability:** We assume that each possible birth order (BBBBB, BGBGB, etc.) has an equal probability of occurring.
* **Large Sample:** We assume the sample of 45 families is large enough to be representative of the population of all families with six children.

**Estimating the Number of Families**

1. **Possible Birth Orders:** There are 2 possibilities for each child (boy or girl), and there are six children. So, there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders.

2. **Estimating Frequency:** If all birth orders are equally likely, we would expect each birth order to occur in approximately 1/64th of the families.

3. **Applying to BGBBB:** Since we observed 45 families with the GBGBBG order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

    *  45 families / (1/64) = 2880 families 

4. **Estimating BGBBB:**  Using the same logic, we would expect approximately 1/64th of the total families to have the BGBBB birth order.

    *  2880 families * (1/64) = 45 families 

**Answer:**

{answer: 45} 

**Important Note:**  This is an estimate based on assumptions. The actual number of families with the BGBBB order could be higher or lower due to factors like genetic predisposition, cultural influences, etc.
