Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Assumptions:** We're assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50%).  We're also assuming that births are independent events (one birth doesn't affect the next).

* **Probability:** The probability of any specific birth order is the same.  For example, the probability of G B G B B G is: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64

* **Estimating Total Families:** Since 45 families had the order G B G B B G, and this order has a probability of 1/64, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:

    * 45 families / (1/64) = 2880 families

* **Estimating Families with B G B B B B:**  The order B G B B B B also has a probability of 1/64.  So, we can estimate the number of families with this order:

    * 2880 families * (1/64) = **{answer: 45 families}** 

**Therefore, our estimate is that there were 45 families surveyed with the birth order B G B B B B.**
