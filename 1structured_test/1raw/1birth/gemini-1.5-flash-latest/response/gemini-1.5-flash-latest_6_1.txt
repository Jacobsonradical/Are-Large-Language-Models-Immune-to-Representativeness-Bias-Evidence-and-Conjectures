Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* We're dealing with probability and assuming that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50/50). 
* We're looking for an estimate, not an exact number. 

**Assumptions and Reasoning:**

* **Equal Probability:**  Each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl.
* **Independence:**  One birth doesn't influence the sex of the next birth.

**Calculating the Estimate:**

1. **Probability of G B G B B G:**  The probability of this specific order is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.  This is because each birth has two possibilities (boy or girl), and we have 6 births.

2. **Families with G B G B B G:** We know 45 families had this specific order.  

3. **Estimated Total Families:**  Since 45 families represent 1/64 of the total, we can estimate the total number of families as follows:

   * 45 families / (1/64) = 2880 families

**Answer:**

{answer: 2880}
