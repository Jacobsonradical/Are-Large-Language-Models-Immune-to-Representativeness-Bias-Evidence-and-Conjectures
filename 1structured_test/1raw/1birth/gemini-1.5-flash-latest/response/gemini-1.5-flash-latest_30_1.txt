Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with probabilities and making an estimate. The key assumption is that the birth of a boy or girl is equally likely (50/50 chance). 

**Calculating the Probability**

* **Probability of G B G B B G:**  Each birth has two possibilities (B or G), so the probability of this specific sequence is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64.

* **Probability of B G B B B B:** This sequence also has a probability of 1/64.

**Estimating the Total Number of Families**

Since 45 families had the sequence G B G B B G, and this sequence has a probability of 1/64, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:

* **Estimate:** 45 families * 64 = **2880 families**

**Answer:** {answer: 2880}
