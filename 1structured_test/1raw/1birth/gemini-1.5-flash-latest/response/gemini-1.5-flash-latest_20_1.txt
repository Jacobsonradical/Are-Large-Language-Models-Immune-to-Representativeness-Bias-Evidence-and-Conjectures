{answer: 0}

Here's why:

* **Probability of a Specific Order:** Each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl.  With six children, there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth order combinations. 
* **Each Order is Equally Likely:** Since each combination is equally likely, the occurrence of any specific order, like G B G B B G, is just as likely as B G B B B B.
* **Survey Implication:** The survey tells us that 45 families out of all families with six children had the order G B G B B G.  This doesn't provide any information about the frequency of other birth orders.

**Therefore, it's reasonable to estimate that there were 0 families with the birth order B G B B B B. It's highly unlikely, but not impossible, that such a family existed in the survey.**
