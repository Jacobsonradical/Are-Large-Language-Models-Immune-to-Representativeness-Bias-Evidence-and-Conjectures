Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with probabilities and the assumption that each birth is independent (the sex of one child doesn't influence the sex of the next).  Since there are two equally likely possibilities for each birth (boy or girl), we can calculate the probability of any specific birth order.

**Calculating Probabilities**

* **Probability of G B G B B G:** (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64
* **Probability of B G B B B B:**  (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64

**Estimating the Number of Families**

Since both birth orders have the same probability, we can expect roughly the same number of families to have each order.
