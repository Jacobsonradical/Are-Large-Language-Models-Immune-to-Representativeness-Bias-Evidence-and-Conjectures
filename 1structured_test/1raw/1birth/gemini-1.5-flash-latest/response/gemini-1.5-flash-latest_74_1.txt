Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Equal Probability:** We assume that for any family, each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl. 
* **Independence:** We assume that the gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of any other child.

**Estimating the Probability:**

* **Each order is equally likely:**  Since each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl, every possible birth order of six children is equally likely. 
* **Calculating the probability:** There are 2 possibilities for each birth (boy or girl), and we have 6 births, so there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders.  
* **Probability of the specific order:** The probability of the specific order G B G B B G is 1/64. 
* **Same probability for B G B B B B:**  The order B G B B B B is also just one out of the 64 possible orders, so it also has a probability of 1/64.

**Estimating the Number of Families:**

* **Ratio:** If 45 families represent a probability of 1/64, we can set up a proportion to estimate the total number of families surveyed:

   (1/64) / 45 = (1/x)  where x is the total number of families

* **Solving for x:** Cross-multiplying gives us: x = 64 * 45 = 2880

**Answer:**

{answer: 2880}
