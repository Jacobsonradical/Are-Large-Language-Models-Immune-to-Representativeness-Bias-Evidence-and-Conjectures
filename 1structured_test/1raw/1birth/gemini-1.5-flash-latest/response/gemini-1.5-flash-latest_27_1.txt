{answer: 0}

**Explanation:**

The probability of any specific birth order (like G B G B B G) for six children is the same for any other specific birth order (like B G B B B B). This is because each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl, and the births are independent events. 

Since the survey found 45 families with the specific order G B G B B G, it is highly unlikely (practically impossible) that any family would have the exact order B G B B B B, as this is just one specific outcome out of many equally likely possibilities.
