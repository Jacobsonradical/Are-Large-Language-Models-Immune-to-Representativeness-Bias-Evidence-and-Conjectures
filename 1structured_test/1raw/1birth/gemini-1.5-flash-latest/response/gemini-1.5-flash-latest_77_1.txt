Here's how to approach this problem:

* **The Problem:** We're dealing with probability and assuming that the birth of a boy or girl is equally likely (a 50/50 chance). 
* **The Pattern:** The specific order G B G B B G is just one of many possible birth orders for six children.
* **Estimating:**  To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we need to understand how many possible birth orders there are.

**Calculations:**

* Each child has two possibilities: boy (B) or girl (G).
* With six children, there are 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2‚Å∂ = 64 possible birth orders.

**Estimating the Number of Families:**

* If 45 families out of a total had the order G B G B B G, this represents approximately 45/64 of the total families surveyed.
* To estimate the number of families with the order B G B B B B, we can assume a similar proportion: (45/64) * total families. 

**Without knowing the total number of families surveyed, we cannot give a specific numerical estimate. However, we can say that the estimated number of families with the order B G B B B B is approximately (45/64) of the total number of families surveyed.**
