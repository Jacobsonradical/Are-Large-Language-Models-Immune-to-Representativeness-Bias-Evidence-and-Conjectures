Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Understanding the Problem:** We're dealing with probabilities and assuming that the sex of each child is independent of the others.  This means each child has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl.
* **Calculating Probability:** The probability of any specific birth order (like G B G B B G) is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64.
* **Estimating the Total:** Since 45 families had the order G B G B B G, and this represents 1/64 of the total families, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed as follows:

  45 families * (64 / 1) = 2880 families

* **Estimating the Number with B G B B B B:**  The probability of the order B G B B B B is also 1/64.  Therefore, we can estimate that approximately:

  2880 families * (1/64) = 45 families 

**{answer: 45}**
