{answer: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Assuming equal probability:** We assume that each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl (this isn't always true in real life, but it's a simplifying assumption for this problem).
* **Independent events:** We assume each birth is independent of the others.  A previous birth doesn't affect the gender of the next child.

With these assumptions, each possible birth order has an equal probability of occurring. Since we observed one specific order (GBGBBG) in 45 families, we can estimate that any other specific order (like BBBBBB) would also occur in approximately 45 families. 

However, it's important to note:

* **Small Sample Size:**  45 families is a small sample size.  A larger sample would give a more reliable estimate.
* **Real-world Factors:**  The assumption of equal probability and independence might not be completely accurate.  Factors like genetics and environmental influences could play a role.
