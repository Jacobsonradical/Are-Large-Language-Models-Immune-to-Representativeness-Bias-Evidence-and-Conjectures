Here's how to think about this problem:

* **Equal Probability:** Assuming there's an equal chance of having a boy or a girl at each birth, each possible birth order (like GBBGBG, BBBBGG, etc.) is equally likely.
* **Many Possibilities:** There are many possible birth orders for a family of six children. 
* **Our Sample:** The fact that 45 families out of all surveyed had the order GBBGBG tells us that this specific order represents a certain proportion of all the possible orders.

**Since each order is equally likely, we can estimate that the order BBBBBB would occur about the same number of times as GBBGBG.  Therefore, our estimate is:**

{answer: 45}
