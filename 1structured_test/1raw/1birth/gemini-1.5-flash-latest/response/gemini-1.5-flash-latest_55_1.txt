Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with probabilities and assuming that the birth of a boy or girl is equally likely (50% chance of each).  Since each birth is independent of the others, we can calculate the probability of a specific birth order.

**Calculating Probability**

* The probability of a single specific birth order (like G B G B B G) is (1/2) ^ 6 = 1/64. This is because there are 6 births, and each birth has two equally likely outcomes.

**Estimating the Number of Families**

* If 45 families had the birth order G B G B B G, and this represents a probability of 1/64, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed.
* Let 'x' be the total number of families surveyed.
* We can set up a proportion: (1/64) = (45/x)
* Solving for x:  x = 45 * 64 = 2880

**Answer**

{answer: 2880}
