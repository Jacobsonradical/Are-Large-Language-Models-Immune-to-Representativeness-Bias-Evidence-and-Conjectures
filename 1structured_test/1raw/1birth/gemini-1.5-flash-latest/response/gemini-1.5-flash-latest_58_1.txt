Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with probabilities and assuming that the birth of a boy or girl is equally likely (a 50/50 chance).  The specific order of births in a family is independent of the order in other families.

**Estimating the Probability**

* **Probability of G B G B B G:**  The probability of a single child being a girl or boy is 1/2. So, the probability of this specific sequence is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64

* **Probability of B G B B B B:**  This sequence has the same probability as the first one: 1/64.

**Estimating the Number of Families**

Since 45 families out of the surveyed group had the sequence G B G B B G, we can assume that this represents a sample of the overall probability of 1/64.  

To estimate the total number of families surveyed, we can set up a proportion:

* (45 families) / (1/64) = (x families) / (1/64) 

Solving for x:

* x = 45 * 64 = 2880

**Answer:**

{answer: 2880}
