Here's how to think about this problem:

* **Assuming equal probability:** We're assuming that each possible birth order is equally likely (this isn't always true in reality, but it's a reasonable starting point).
* **Possible birth orders:** There are 2 possible outcomes for each birth (boy or girl), and we have 6 births. This means there are 2^6 = 64 possible birth orders.
* **Estimating the frequency:**  If all birth orders are equally likely, then the order G B G B B G should occur in approximately 1/64 of the families.  

Since we know 45 families had this birth order, we can estimate the total number of families surveyed:

* **Total Families â‰ˆ (45 families) * (64 possible birth orders) = 2880 families**

**Answer: {answer: 2880}**
