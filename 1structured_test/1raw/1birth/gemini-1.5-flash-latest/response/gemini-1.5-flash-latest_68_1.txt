{answer: 1}

Here's why:

* **Probability:**  Each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl (assuming a 50/50 probability).
* **Independent Events:**  Each birth is independent of the others.  The sex of one child doesn't influence the sex of the next.

Since each birth has a 50% chance of being a boy or girl, the probability of any specific birth order (like G B G B B G or B G B B B B) is:

(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64

This means that for every 64 families surveyed, on average, you would expect one family to have the exact birth order of B G B B B B. 

Therefore, with 45 families having the birth order G B G B B G, we can estimate that approximately **one** family would have the birth order B G B B B B.
