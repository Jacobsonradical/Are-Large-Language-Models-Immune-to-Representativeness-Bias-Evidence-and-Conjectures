{answer: 45} 

Here's why:

We're assuming that each birth has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl (a 50/50 probability). This means that every possible birth order combination has the same probability of occurring. 

Since the order G B G B B G was found in 45 families, we can estimate that the same number of families would have the order B G B B B B.
