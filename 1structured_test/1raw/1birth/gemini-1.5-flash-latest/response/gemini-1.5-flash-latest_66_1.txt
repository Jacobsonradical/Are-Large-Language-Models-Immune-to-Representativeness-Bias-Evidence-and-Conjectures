Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

The question is asking us to estimate how many families in the city would have a specific birth order (all boys) based on the observed frequency of a different birth order (G B G B B G).

**Assumptions**

* **Equal Probability of Boys and Girls:**  We assume that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal (50% each).
* **Independent Births:** We assume that the gender of one child doesn't influence the gender of any other child in the family.

**Reasoning**

If the probability of having a boy or girl is equal, each birth order combination for six children has an equal chance of occurring. 

* The observed birth order (G B G B B G) is just one out of many possible birth orders.
* Since all birth orders are equally likely, the observed frequency of "G B G B B G" tells us nothing specific about the expected frequency of any other birth order, including "B G B B B B".

**Estimate**

Without more information about the total number of families surveyed or any other observed birth orders, we cannot make a reliable estimate of how many families had the birth order "B G B B B B".

**Answer**

{answer:  We cannot estimate the number of families with the birth order B G B B B B based on the given information.}
