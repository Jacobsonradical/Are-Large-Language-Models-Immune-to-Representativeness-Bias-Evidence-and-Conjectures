Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* We're dealing with probabilities of birth order, assuming an equal chance of having a boy or a girl.
* The survey data tells us the frequency of one specific birth order (GBGBBG).
* We want to estimate the frequency of a different birth order (BGBBBBB).

**Assumptions:**

* We're assuming that the probability of having a boy or girl is equal (50/50).
* We're assuming that the births of children in a family are independent events (one birth doesn't influence the next).

**Calculations:**

* **Probability of GBGBBG:**  (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64
* **Probability of BGBBBBB:** (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64

**Estimation:**

* Since both birth orders have the same probability, we can expect to see them occur with similar frequency in a large enough sample. 
* Therefore, our estimate for the number of families with the birth order BGBBBBB would also be **45**.

**Answer:** {answer: 45}
