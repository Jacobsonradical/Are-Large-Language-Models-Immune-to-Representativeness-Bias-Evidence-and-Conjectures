{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. Since Team 2 surveys only one man each day, they have a higher chance of surveying a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1. Team 1, on the other hand, surveys three men each day but only considers the middle man's height. In this case, even if one of the other two men is taller than 183 cm, it won't be counted if they are not the middle man in terms of height. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher probability of counting more such days.
