{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.

Here's the reasoning:

1. The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average. This means the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean, with a roughly equal number of men taller and shorter than the average height.

2. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. Since the distribution of heights is symmetric, the middle man's height is likely to be close to the average height (178 cm). Therefore, it's less likely that the middle man's height will be taller than 183 cm on a regular basis.

3. Team 2 surveys only one man each day. This means that, in a way, Team 2 has a "wider net" to find taller men, as they are not limited to the middle height of a group of three, but can include any man in the population.

4. Given that both teams are surveying men from the same population, it's more likely that Team 2 will find men taller than 183 cm more frequently than Team 1 will find the middle man taller than 183 cm.

5. Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.
