{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. Since Team 2 surveys one man each day, compared to Team 1's three men, Team 2 has an equal chance of encountering men taller than 183 cm as Team 1 does for each individual man surveyed. However, because Team 2 surveys fewer men each day, they are not limited to selecting only the middle man from a group of three, as Team 1 is. Thus, Team 2 has a higher probability of encountering men taller than 183 cm, making it more likely they will record more such days.
