{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more such days. Here's why:

Team 1 surveys three men each day and records the number of days on which the middle man is taller than 183 cm. However, since there are as many men whose height is above average (178 cm) as there are men whose height is below average, it's reasonable to assume that on any given day, the likelihood of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is relatively low.

Team 2, on the other hand, surveys one man each day and records the number of days on which the man is taller than 183 cm. Even though they are surveying fewer men per day, they are not limited to considering only the middle man in their survey. Therefore, they are more likely to record more instances of men taller than 183 cm.

Of course, this is an estimation based on the given information, and the actual results could vary based on the specific distribution of heights in the population and the randomness of the sampling process. However, based on the information given, Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more such days.
