Since the problem does not provide specific information about the distribution of heights beyond the average and the fact that the distribution is symmetric around the average, I will make some assumptions based on a normal distribution, which is commonly used to model human characteristics such as height.

Assuming that heights are normally distributed around the mean of 178 cm, the likelihood of a man being taller than 183 cm can be estimated. For Team 1, they need at least 2 men to be taller than 183 cm to have the middle man taller than 183 cm. For Team 2, they just need one man to be taller than 183 cm.

Since both teams are surveying the same population and the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams, it is more likely for Team 2 to record more days where the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm. This is because the requirement for Team 1 is stricter, needing 2 out of 3 men to be taller than 183 cm, while Team 2 only needs 1 out of 1.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}

But please note that this answer is based on assumptions and the actual result could vary depending on the specific height distribution in the population. For a more precise answer, more detailed information about the height distribution would be required.
