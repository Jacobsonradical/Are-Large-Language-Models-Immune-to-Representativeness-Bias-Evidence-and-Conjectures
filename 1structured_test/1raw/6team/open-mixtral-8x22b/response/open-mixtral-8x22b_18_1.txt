{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. Here's why:

For Team 1, the middle man being taller than 183 cm requires that at least two out of the three men surveyed each day are taller than 183 cm. This is less likely than just one man being taller than 183 cm, as required for Team 2's count.

Given that the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, it's reasonable to assume that the distribution of heights is roughly symmetrical around the mean. In this case, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

Therefore, the probability of two out of three men being taller than 183 cm (as required for Team 1's count) is even lower, and significantly lower than the probability of just one man being taller than 183 cm (as required for Team 2's count).

So, Team 2 is likely to have recorded more such days. However, the exact probabilities would depend on the specific distribution of heights in the population, which isn't provided in the question.
