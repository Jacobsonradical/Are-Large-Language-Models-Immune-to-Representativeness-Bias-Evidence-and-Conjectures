{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days. Here's why:

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. For Team 1 to count a day as having a man taller than 183 cm, the middle man (ranked 2 out of 3) must be taller than 183 cm. This means that at least two out of the three men surveyed by Team 1 must be taller than 183 cm.

Team 2, on the other hand, only needs to survey one man each day who is taller than 183 cm to count a day. Since the average height of men is 178 cm, and there are as many men taller than average as there are shorter than average, there will be a significant number of men taller than 183 cm in the population.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 will count more days with men taller than 183 cm, as they only need to find one such man each day, whereas Team 1 needs to find at least two.
