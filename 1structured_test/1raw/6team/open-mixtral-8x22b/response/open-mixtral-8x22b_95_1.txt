To answer this question, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and how each team's sampling method affects their counts. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the distribution is roughly symmetric around the average height of 178 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. Since the distribution is symmetric, we can expect that the middle man in a group of three will be closer to the average height than the extremes. Therefore, Team 1 will have fewer days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm.

On the other hand, Team 2 surveys only one man each day and counts the number of days when that man is taller than 183 cm. While this means they may miss some men who are taller than 183 cm, they are also more likely to capture men who are significantly taller than the average.

Considering these factors, it is more likely that Team 2 will count more days with men taller than 183 cm than Team 1. However, without specific data on the distribution of heights or the actual counts from each team, we cannot say for certain that their counts are within 5% of each other.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 2}
