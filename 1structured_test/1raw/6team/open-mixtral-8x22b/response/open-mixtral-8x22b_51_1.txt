{team: 2}

I believe Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. The reasoning is that while Team 1 only counts the middle man as taller than 183 cm, Team 2 includes all men taller than 183 cm in their count. Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as there are below, there is a higher probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm in a single random pick than finding a man taller than 183 cm specifically in the middle position when picking three men at random. However, this is an estimation and would depend on the actual distribution of heights in the population.
