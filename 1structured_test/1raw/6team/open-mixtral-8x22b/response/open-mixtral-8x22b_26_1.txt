{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 surveys only one man per day and that man can be of any height, while Team 1 surveys three men per day and ranks them. For Team 1 to count a day where the middle man is taller than 183 cm, two conditions need to be met: 1) at least two men surveyed must be taller than 183 cm, and 2) the third man must be shorter than the tallest of the first two. Given that the average height is 178 cm and that there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, it is less likely for Team 1 to encounter the scenario where the middle man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2 encountering a man taller than 183 cm.
