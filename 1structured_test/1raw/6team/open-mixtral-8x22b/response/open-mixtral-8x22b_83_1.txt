{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with men taller than 183 cm. The reasoning behind this is that Team 2 surveys one man each day, while Team 1 ranks three men daily but only considers the middle man's height. Since the average height is around 178 cm and there are as many men above and below the average, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is lower for Team 1 than it is for Team 2. Team 2 has a higher chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm because they survey more individuals daily. Team 1 only considers the middle-ranked man, which is more likely to be closer to the average height. Therefore, Team 2 should have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.
