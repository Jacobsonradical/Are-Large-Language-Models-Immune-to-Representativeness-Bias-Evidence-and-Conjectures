{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. The reason is that Team 1 is only surveying three men each day and selecting the middle man, which means they are not necessarily picking the tallest man from the group. On the other hand, Team 2 is specifically looking for men taller than 183 cm each day, increasing their chances of finding taller men. Given the distribution of heights in the population, Team 2 would most likely find more men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
