To answer this question, we need to consider the sampling methods of both teams and the distribution of heights in the population.

Team 1 samples three men each day and ranks them by height. They count the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below it, about half of the men are taller than 178 cm.

To be the middle man taller than 183 cm, at least two of the three men sampled by Team 1 must be taller than 183 cm. This is less likely than just one man being taller than 183 cm, which is what Team 2 is looking for in their daily sample of one man.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 will count more days with men taller than 183 cm than Team 1. However, without specific information about the distribution of heights above 178 cm, it is difficult to say for certain.

Considering the criteria provided, I would lean towards Team 2 counting more such days. But since the question asks for an answer within 5% of each other, I would say that they are about the same.

So, the answer would be:
{team: 3}
