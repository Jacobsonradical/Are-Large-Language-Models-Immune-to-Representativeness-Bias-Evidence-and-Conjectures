{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days. Since Team 2 surveys only one man per day, they have a higher chance of selecting a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1, which selects three men and only considers the middle one.

The reasoning is as follows:

1. The average height of men is 178 cm, and the height of interest is 183 cm. This means that men taller than 183 cm are in the upper tail of the height distribution.
2. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them. The height of the middle man can be above or below the average height, but it is less likely to be in the upper tail of the distribution.
3. Team 2 surveys only one man each day. This means that their sample has a higher chance of including a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1's middle man.
4. Since Team 2 is more likely to include men taller than 183 cm in their daily samples, they are expected to count more such days than Team 1.

However, the exact numbers would depend on the specific height distribution of the population. Given the information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days than Team 1.
