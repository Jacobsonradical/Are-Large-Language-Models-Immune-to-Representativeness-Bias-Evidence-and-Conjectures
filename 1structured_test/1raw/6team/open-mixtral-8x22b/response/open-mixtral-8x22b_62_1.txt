To determine which team recorded more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm, we need to compare the probabilities of each team encountering such a man in their respective surveys.

Let's first consider Team 1, which surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. For any given day, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm (which is 5 cm above the average height of 178 cm) can be calculated. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the heights of men are normally distributed around the average height of 178 cm.

The probability that a single man surveyed by Team 1 is taller than 183 cm is the area under the normal distribution curve beyond 183 cm. To find the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm, we need to consider the ordering of the three men surveyed. However, without specific information about the standard deviation of the height distribution, we cannot calculate this probability exactly.

Now, let's consider Team 2, which surveys only one man each day. The probability that the man they survey is taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability mentioned above for Team 1 surveying a single man.

Since Team 1 surveys three men each day, they have three chances to find a man taller than 183 cm, while Team 2 has only one chance each day. Therefore, it is more likely that Team 1 will record more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

However, without specific information about the distribution of heights in the population, it is not possible to definitively conclude that Team 1 will record more such days than Team 2 by a significant margin (more than 5%). Nevertheless, based on the information provided, it seems more likely that Team 1 would record more such days.

Therefore, my answer is:
{team: 1}
