{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. Since Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them, they are less likely to have the middle man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2, which surveys only one man each day. With Team 1, there's a higher chance that at least one of the three men will be shorter than 183 cm, making it less likely for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. On the other hand, Team 2 has a 50% chance each day of surveying a man taller than 178 cm (the average height), increasing the likelihood of recording a man taller than 183 cm.
