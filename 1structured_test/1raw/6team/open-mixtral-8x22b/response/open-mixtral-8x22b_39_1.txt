{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days.

The reasoning is as follows:

1. The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
2. There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
3. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. The middle man's height is more than 183 cm only if at least two of the three men are taller than 183 cm.
4. Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man each day. The man's height is more than 183 cm if he is taller than 183 cm.
5. Since there are as many men taller than 183 cm as there are men shorter than 183 cm, it is more likely for Team 2 to survey a man taller than 183 cm on any given day than it is for Team 1 to survey at least two men taller than 183 cm on any given day.
6. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days than Team 1.

This conclusion is based on the assumption that the height distribution of men in the population is symmetric around the mean and that the sampling is random and independent for both teams.

Additionally, the question asks if the teams are within 5% of each other. Given the larger sample size for Team 2 (365 vs 365*3), their results are unlikely to be within 5% of each other, making option 3 less likely.
