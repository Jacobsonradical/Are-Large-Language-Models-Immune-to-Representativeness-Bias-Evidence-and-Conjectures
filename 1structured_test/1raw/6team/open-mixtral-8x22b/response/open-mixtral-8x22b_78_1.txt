{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.

Here's my reasoning:

1. Both teams are surveying men from the same population with an average height of 178 cm.
2. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the distribution of heights is roughly symmetric.
3. Team 1 is surveying three men each day and ranking them by height. They are counting the number of days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm.
4. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, two conditions must be met: (1) at least two of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183 cm, and (2) the tallest man must not be more than 183 cm taller than the shortest man.
5. Team 2, on the other hand, is surveying only one man each day and counting the number of days when that man is taller than 183 cm.
6. Since Team 2 is surveying fewer men each day, they have a higher chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1 does of finding three men where the middle man is taller than 183 cm.
7. Therefore, I think Team 2 will record more days with men taller than 183 cm than Team 1.
