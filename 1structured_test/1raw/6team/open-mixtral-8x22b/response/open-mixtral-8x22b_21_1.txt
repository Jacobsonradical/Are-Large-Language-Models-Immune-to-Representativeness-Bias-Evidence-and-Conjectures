{team: 2}

Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. The reasoning is as follows:

- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 is surveying three men each day and ranking them based on their height. On average, the middle man's height will be close to the population average of 178 cm. Hence, the middle man being taller than 183 cm will not be a common occurrence.
- Team 2, on the other hand, is surveying only one man each day. Since the distribution of heights is symmetrical around the average height, there will be a significant proportion of men with heights above 183 cm.
- Since Team 2 is more likely to survey a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1's middle man being taller than 183 cm, Team 2 will record more such days.
