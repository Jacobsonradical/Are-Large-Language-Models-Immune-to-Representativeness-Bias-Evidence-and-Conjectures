To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on any given day.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. The team then identifies days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm. Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average height as below, we can infer that approximately half the men are taller than 178 cm. However, the question asks about men taller than 183 cm, which is 5 cm above the average. The exact proportion of men taller than 183 cm is not given, but we can assume it's less than half since 183 cm is above the average.

For Team 1 to record a day where the middle man is taller than 183 cm, at least two of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm. This is because the middle man is, by definition, not the tallest or the shortest of the three. The probability of this happening depends on the proportion of men taller than 183 cm, which is not given. However, since this condition is stricter than just finding one man taller than 183 cm, we can expect Team 1 to record fewer such days than Team 2.

Team 2 surveys only one man each day and records days where that man is taller than 183 cm. The probability of this happening is simply the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm. This probability is not given, but it is more likely to occur than the condition for Team 1 (finding at least two men taller than 183 cm out of three).

Without the exact proportion of men taller than 183 cm, it's impossible to definitively say which team will record more such days. However, based on the information given, it's more likely that Team 2 will record more days where the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, my answer is: {team: 2}
