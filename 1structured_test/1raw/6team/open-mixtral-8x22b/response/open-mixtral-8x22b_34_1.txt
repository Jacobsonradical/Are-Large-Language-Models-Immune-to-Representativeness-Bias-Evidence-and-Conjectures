Before providing a definitive answer, let's consider the information given and make some assumptions to simplify the situation:

1. The population has a symmetrical distribution of heights around the average of 178 cm, with an equal number of men taller and shorter than the average.

2. Team 1 surveys three men per day and ranks them by height. The condition for counting a day as positive is that the middle man must be taller than 183 cm.

3. Team 2 surveys one man per day and counts the day as positive if that man is taller than 183 cm.

To compare the two teams, we can consider the probability of each team having a successful day (i.e., finding a man taller than 183 cm). For Team 1, the condition is more specific (the middle man must be taller than 183 cm), which might intuitively suggest that Team 1 would have fewer positive days. However, the fact that they survey three men per day increases their chances of finding such a man compared to Team 2, which surveys only one man per day.

To provide a more accurate comparison, we would need additional information about the distribution of heights in the population, specifically the percentage of men taller than 183 cm. However, given the limited information provided and the assumption that the population's height distribution is symmetrical, it's reasonable to assume that Team 1 would have more successful days than Team 2.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 1}

Please note that this answer relies on certain assumptions and may not hold true if the actual distribution of heights significantly deviates from the symmetrical pattern assumed here.
