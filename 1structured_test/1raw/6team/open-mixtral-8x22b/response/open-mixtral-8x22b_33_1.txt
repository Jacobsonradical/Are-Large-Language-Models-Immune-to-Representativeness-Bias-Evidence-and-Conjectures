{team: 2}

I think Team 2 counted more such days. Here's the reasoning:

1. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183 cm. However, since the average height is around 178 cm, it's less likely to find two or three men taller than 183 cm in a group of three men.

2. Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man each day. For Team 2 to record a day with a man taller than 183 cm, they only need to find one man taller than 183 cm. This means that even if only a small portion of the population is taller than 183 cm, Team 2 will still have a chance to record those days.

3. Given that there are as many men whose height is above average (178 cm) as there are men whose height is below average, it's reasonable to assume that there will be a significant number of men taller than 183 cm in the population. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of recording more days with men taller than 183 cm.

4. Since Team 1 has to find two or three men taller than 183 cm each day to record a day, and Team 2 only needs to find one, it's more likely that Team 2 will record more such days than Team 1.

5. It's also worth noting that the question asks if the two teams are within 5% of each other. Given the difference in the sampling methods, it's unlikely that the two teams will be within 5% of each other in terms of the number of days recorded with men taller than 183 cm. Therefore, I don't think they are about the same.

Based on this reasoning, I believe Team 2 recorded more such days than Team 1.
