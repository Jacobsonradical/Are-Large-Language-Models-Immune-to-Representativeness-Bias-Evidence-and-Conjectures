{team: 2}

Team 2 is expected to record more days where the surveyed man's height is taller than 183 cm.

Here's why:

Consider the distribution of men's heights in the population. This distribution is symmetric around the average height of 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

When Team 1 surveys three men each day, they rank these men according to their heights. The probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is relatively low because there are many men in the population who are shorter than this height.

On the other hand, Team 2 surveys just one man each day. The probability that this man is taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability that the middle man from Team 1's sample is taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1's ranking procedure effectively filters out men who are taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 2 is expected to record more days where the surveyed man's height is taller than 183 cm.

However, it's important to note that this analysis assumes that both teams are sampling from the same population and that the distribution of men's heights is known. If this is not the case, the results could be different.
