{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. Since Team 2 surveys only one man each day, they are more likely to survey taller men than Team 1, which ranks three men daily and only counts the middle man if he is taller than 183 cm. Given that the average height is 178 cm, there are fewer men taller than 183 cm, making it less likely for Team 1 to record such days compared to Team 2.

However, this is a statistical estimation, and actual results may vary depending on the specific population and distribution of heights in that population.
