{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men and only considers the middle man's height. Given that the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is relatively low.

Team 2 surveys only one man per day, but every man they survey has a chance to be taller than 183 cm. Since the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean, there will be a significant number of men taller than 183 cm in the population.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to record more such days than Team 1.
