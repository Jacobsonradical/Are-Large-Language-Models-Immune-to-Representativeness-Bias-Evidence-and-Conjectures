{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. This is because they surveyed one man per day, whereas Team 1 ranked three men each day and counted only the middle man. The probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm in each survey is higher for Team 2 since they have a chance of finding one such man every day, while Team 1 only counts the middle man out of the three. However, this depends on the distribution of heights in the population and the specific criteria (183 cm) used for comparison.
