{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 surveys one man per day, and there is a higher chance of picking a man who is taller than 183 cm when surveying one man as opposed to picking the middle man who is taller than 183 cm when surveying three men.

When Team 1 surveys three men, the middle man could be the shortest, the tallest, or in between. On the other hand, Team 2 has a 50% chance of picking a man who is taller than the average height of 178 cm, which increases the chances of picking a man taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, even though the question does not provide enough information to calculate the exact numbers, it is reasonable to assume that Team 2 would have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.
