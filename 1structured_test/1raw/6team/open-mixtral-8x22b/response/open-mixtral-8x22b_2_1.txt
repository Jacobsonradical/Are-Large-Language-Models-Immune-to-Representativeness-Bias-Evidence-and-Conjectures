{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Both teams are sampling from the same population with an average height of 178 cm.
2. We know that the distribution of heights is approximately symmetric since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
3. Team 1 is surveying three men each day, and only counting the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. This means that on those days, at least two men are taller than 183 cm.
4. Team 2 is surveying only one man each day, and counting the days when that man is taller than 183 cm.
5. Since the distribution of heights is symmetric and the average height is 178 cm, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is relatively low.
6. Because Team 2 is surveying fewer men each day but still counting any man taller than 183 cm, they have a higher chance of recording more days with men taller than 183 cm than Team 1, who must have at least two men taller than 183 cm on the days they count.
7. Therefore, it is likely that Team 2 recorded more such days than Team 1.
