{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days. The reasoning behind this is that Team 2 is surveying only one man each day whose height is more than 183 cm, while Team 1 is only counting the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Considering the average height is 178 cm, the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of the middle man in a group of three being taller than 183 cm. Since there are as many men taller than average as there are shorter, the chance of picking a man taller than 183 cm is still higher than picking three men with the middle one taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with men taller than 183 cm.
