{team: 2}

Explanation:

While the question does not allow us to calculate the exact probabilities without more information, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided.

Team 1 surveys three men each day, and ranks them by height. The middle man is the second tallest of the three. Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the distribution of heights is somewhat symmetrical around the mean. However, the height of the middle man in a group of three will be less likely to be more than 183 cm, as there needs to be at least one man in the group who is taller than 183 cm, and the middle man is only the second tallest.

On the other hand, Team 2 surveys only one man each day, and counts the number of days on which the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm. Since the height of the man surveyed by Team 2 is not restricted to being the middle man in a group of three, it is more likely that the man surveyed by Team 2 will be taller than 183 cm than the middle man in a group of three surveyed by Team 1.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 recorded more days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm than Team 1. The exact probabilities would depend on the specific distribution of heights in the population, but based on the information provided, we can make an educated guess that Team 2 recorded more such days.
