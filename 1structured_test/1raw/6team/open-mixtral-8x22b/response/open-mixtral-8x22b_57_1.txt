{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. The reasoning behind this is that Team 2 surveys one man daily, while Team 1 surveys three men daily but only records the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height of men is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the distribution of heights is somewhat symmetrical around the mean. This means that there will be fewer men who are significantly taller than the average height of 178 cm compared to those who are close to the average height.

Team 1 only records the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm, which is a stricter criterion compared to Team 2, who records every man whose height exceeds 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.
