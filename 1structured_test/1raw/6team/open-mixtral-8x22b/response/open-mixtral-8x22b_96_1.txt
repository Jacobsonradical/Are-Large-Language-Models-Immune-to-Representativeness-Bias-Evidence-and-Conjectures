{team: 2}

Explanation:

Since the average height of men is 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the height of men follows a normal distribution with the mean at 178 cm.

In Team 1's case, they are surveying three men each day and only counting days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. This means that not only must the middle man be taller than 183 cm, but also at least one of the other two men must be shorter than the middle man (otherwise, the middle man would not be in the middle).

In Team 2's case, they are surveying only one man each day and counting days when that man is taller than 183 cm. Since they are only considering one man, there are no restrictions on the heights of other men.

Therefore, Team 2 has a higher probability of counting more days when the man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1. This is because Team 1's method imposes additional constraints on the height of the middle man, while Team 2's method does not.

So, I would answer 2 for Team 2.
