{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 is selecting one man at random each day, while Team 1 is selecting three men and only considering the middle one. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men taller than average as there are shorter, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is low, especially when considering only the middle man out of three. Therefore, Team 2, which considers any man taller than 183 cm, has a higher chance of recording more such days.
