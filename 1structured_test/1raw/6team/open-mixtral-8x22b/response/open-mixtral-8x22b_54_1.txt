{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more such days. The reason being that Team 2 surveys only one man each day and they count the days when the height of the man is more than 183 cm. On the other hand, Team 1 surveys three men each day but only counts the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, there will be fewer instances when the middle man is taller than 183 cm compared to instances when any one man is taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have more such days.
