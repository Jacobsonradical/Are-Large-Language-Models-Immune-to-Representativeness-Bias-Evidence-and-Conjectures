{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1's method of selecting three men and choosing the middle one makes it less likely that they will select a man taller than 183 cm, as compared to Team 2's method of selecting just one man.

To illustrate this, let's consider a simplified example with a population of 9 men with heights 170, 175, 178, 180, 182, 183, 185, 188, and 190 cm. The average height is 180 cm, and there are 4 men taller than the average height.

If Team 1 surveys three men at random each day and selects the middle man, they could end up with the following scenarios:

1. Selecting the men with heights 170, 175, and 178 cm (middle man is 175 cm)
2. Selecting the men with heights 170, 175, and 180 cm (middle man is 175 cm)
3. Selecting the men with heights 170, 175, and 182 cm (middle man is 175 cm)
4. Selecting the men with heights 170, 175, and 183 cm (middle man is 175 cm)
5. Selecting the men with heights 170, 175, and 185 cm (middle man is 175 cm)
6. Selecting the men with heights 170, 175, and 188 cm (middle man is 175 cm)
7. Selecting the men with heights 170, 175, and 190 cm (middle man is 175 cm)
8. Selecting the men with heights 170, 178, and 180 cm (middle man is 178 cm)
9. Selecting the men with heights 170, 178, and 182 cm (middle man is 178 cm)
10. Selecting the men with heights 170, 178, and 183 cm (middle man is 178 cm)
11. Selecting the men with heights 170, 178, and 185 cm (middle man is 178 cm)
12. Selecting the men with heights 170, 178, and 188 cm (middle man is 178 cm)
13. Selecting the men with heights 170, 178, and 190 cm (middle man is 178 cm)
14. Selecting the men with heights 170, 180, and 182 cm (middle man is 180 cm)
15. Selecting the men with heights 170, 180, and 183 cm (middle man is 180 cm)
16. Selecting the men with heights 170, 180, and 185 cm (middle man is 180 cm)
17. Selecting the men with heights 170, 180, and 188 cm (middle man is 180 cm)
18. Selecting the men with heights 170, 180, and 190 cm (middle man is 180 cm)
19. Selecting the men with heights 170, 182, and 183 cm (middle man is 182 cm)
20. Selecting the men with heights 170, 182, and 185 cm (middle man is 182 cm)
21. Selecting the men with heights 170, 182, and 188 cm (middle man is 182 cm)
22. Selecting the men with heights 170, 182, and 190 cm (middle man is 182 cm)
23. Selecting the men with heights 170, 183, and 185 cm (middle man is 183 cm)
24. Selecting the men with heights 170, 183, and 188 cm (middle man is 183 cm)
25. Selecting the men with heights 170, 183, and 190 cm (middle man is 183 cm)

There are only 12 scenarios where the middle man is taller than 183 cm, which is 12 out of a possible 25 scenarios (48%).

On the other hand, if Team 2 surveys just one man at random, they have a 4 out of 9 chance (44.4%) of selecting a man taller than 183 cm. However, since they are surveying one man per day, they have a higher chance of encountering a man taller than 183 cm more frequently than Team 1, as they are not restricted by the middle man requirement.

While this is a simplified example, it illustrates the concept that Team 2 has a higher chance of recording more days with men taller than 183 cm due to their surveying method.
