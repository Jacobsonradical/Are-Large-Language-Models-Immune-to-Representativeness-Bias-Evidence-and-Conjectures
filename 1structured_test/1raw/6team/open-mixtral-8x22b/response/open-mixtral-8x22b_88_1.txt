{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with men taller than 183 cm. Since Team 2 surveys only one man each day, their sample size is smaller than Team 1, which surveys three men each day. However, Team 2 can count a day if the single man surveyed is taller than 183 cm, while Team 1 can only count a day if the middle man of the three surveyed is taller than 183 cm. The probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm in a single survey is higher than finding a middle man taller than 183 cm in a group of three, especially when considering that half of the men are below average height (178 cm). Therefore, Team 2 has a better chance of counting more days with men taller than 183 cm.
