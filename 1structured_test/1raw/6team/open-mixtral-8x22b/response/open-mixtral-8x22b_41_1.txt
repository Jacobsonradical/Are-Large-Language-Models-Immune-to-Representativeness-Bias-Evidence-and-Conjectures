To solve this problem, we need to make some assumptions and use probability theory. Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the distribution of height is symmetric around the mean.

However, without knowing the exact distribution of height (e.g., standard deviation), we cannot calculate the exact probabilities. But we can still make some educated guesses.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them. The middle man is the second tallest of the three. Since the distribution is symmetric, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm (which is 5 cm above the average) should be the same as the probability of selecting a man shorter than 173 cm (which is also 5 cm below the average).

Team 2 surveys only one man each day. The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm in Team 1.

However, since Team 1 selects three men each day and ranks them, they have a higher chance of having at least one man taller than 183 cm among the three, compared to Team 2 which selects only one man each day.

Without exact probabilities, it's impossible to say for sure, but based on the information given, it seems more likely that Team 1 would record more days with a man taller than 183 cm.

So, the answer is:
{team: 1}
