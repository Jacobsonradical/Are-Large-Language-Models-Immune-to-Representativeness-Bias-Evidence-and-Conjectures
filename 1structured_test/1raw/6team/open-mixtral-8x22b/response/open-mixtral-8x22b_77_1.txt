{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days. Here's the reasoning:

1. Both teams are surveying men from the same population with an average height of 178 cm.
2. The men whose height is above average (i.e., taller than 178 cm) are equally distributed as those whose height is below average.
3. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them based on height. They count the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. However, in most cases, the middle man will be closer to the average height (178 cm) than the extremes. Therefore, it's less likely for the middle man to be significantly taller than 183 cm.
4. Team 2 surveys only one man each day and counts the days when the man is taller than 183 cm. Since the men with height above average are equally distributed, there will be a higher chance of encountering a man taller than 183 cm in their daily sampling.
5. Considering the above points, Team 2 has a higher probability of counting more days when the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm than Team 1.
