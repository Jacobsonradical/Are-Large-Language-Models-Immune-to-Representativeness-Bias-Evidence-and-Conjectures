{team: 2}

The reasoning behind this is that Team 2 has a higher probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm each day compared to Team 1. Team 1 surveys three men each day, and only if the middle man is taller than 183 cm, the team will count that day. In contrast, Team 2 surveys only one man each day, but any man taller than 183 cm is counted.

Given that the average height is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, it's more likely for Team 2 to encounter a man taller than 183 cm in their single daily survey than for Team 1 to have that man be the middle height in their three daily surveys.

Therefore, it is expected that Team 2 will record more days with men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
