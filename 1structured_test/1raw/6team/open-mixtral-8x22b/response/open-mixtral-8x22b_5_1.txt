To determine which team recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm, let's analyze the situation and make some assumptions.

Assumptions:
1. The population is large enough that the sampling of three men per day by Team 1 and one man per day by Team 2 does not significantly change the distribution of heights in the remaining population.
2. The distribution of heights within the population is roughly symmetric around the mean height of 178 cm.
3. The standard deviation of the height distribution is not given, but we can assume it is a reasonable value to make the problem tractable.

Given that there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can infer that the distribution is symmetric around the mean. The mean height is 178 cm, and we want to find the proportion of men taller than 183 cm.

Since we don't have the standard deviation, we cannot calculate the exact proportion of men taller than 183 cm. However, we can still make some inferences based on the information provided:

1. Team 1 surveys three men per day and ranks them. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two of the three men must be taller than 183 cm.
2. Team 2 surveys only one man per day, and they count the days when the man is taller than 183 cm.

Intuitively, it seems more likely that Team 2 would count more days with men taller than 183 cm because they only need one man to meet the criteria, while Team 1 requires at least two of the three men to be taller than 183 cm.

However, without knowing the exact distribution of heights, it is difficult to say definitively which team would record more such days. Considering the assumptions and the fact that Team 1 needs to have at least two men taller than 183 cm, it is reasonable to assume that Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
