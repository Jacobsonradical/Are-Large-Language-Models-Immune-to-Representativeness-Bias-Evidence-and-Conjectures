{team: 2}

This is a probability problem. Since the average height of men is around 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume a normal distribution of heights centered around 178 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them. The probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability that any one man is taller than 183 cm, because the middle man must not only be tall himself, but also have at least one of the other two men be shorter than him.

Team 2 surveys only one man each day. The probability that this man is taller than 183 cm is simply the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. However, without knowing the exact distribution of heights, it is impossible to say for certain whether the difference is within 5% or not. But based on the given information, Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more such days.
