{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. Since Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them, they are more likely to have the middle man be of average height or below due to the distribution of heights. On the other hand, Team 2 surveys only one man each day, and since there are men in the population taller than 183 cm, they are more likely to encounter such men in their daily surveys. However, this is an educated guess based on the given information, and actual results may vary.
