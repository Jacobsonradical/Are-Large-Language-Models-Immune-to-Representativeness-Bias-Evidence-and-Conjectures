{team: 1}

I think Team 1 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. Since Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them, the probability of having a man taller than 183 cm in the middle position is higher than Team 2, which surveys only one man each day.

However, this is a rough estimation and depends on the actual distribution of heights in the population. If the distribution is highly skewed or there are not enough men taller than 183 cm in the population, the results may differ.

To confirm this, you would need to perform a more detailed statistical analysis considering the distribution of heights in the population.
