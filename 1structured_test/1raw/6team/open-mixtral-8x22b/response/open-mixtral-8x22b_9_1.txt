To solve this problem, we need to make some assumptions and simplifications. Let's assume that the height distribution of men in the population is a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are below average, we can assume that the distribution is symmetric around the mean.

For Team 1, each day they survey three men and rank them by height. The middle man will have a height greater than 183 cm if both of the other two men have heights less than 183 cm. Since the height distribution is symmetric, the probability of this happening is equal to the probability that a single randomly selected man has a height less than 183 cm squared.

Let X be the height of a randomly selected man, and let F(x) be the cumulative distribution function of X. Then the probability that X is less than 183 cm is F(183). Therefore, the probability that the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm is (F(183))^2.

For Team 2, each day they survey one man, and they count the number of days on which the height of the man is greater than 183 cm. The probability of this happening is equal to the probability that a single randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm, which is 1 - F(183).

To compare the two probabilities, we can calculate the ratio (F(183))^2 / (1 - F(183)). If this ratio is greater than 1, then Team 1 is more likely to record more such days than Team 2, and vice versa. If the ratio is close to 1, then the two teams are about the same.

However, without knowing the exact distribution of heights in the population, we cannot calculate the exact value of this ratio. Nevertheless, since the height of 183 cm is above the average height of 178 cm, we can expect that the probability of a man having a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5. Therefore, the probability of a man having a height less than 183 cm is greater than 0.5, and the square of this probability is even greater. Thus, we can expect that Team 1 is more likely to record more such days than Team 2.

Therefore, the answer is 1.
