{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because, for Team 1 to record a day as such, all three men randomly surveyed would need to have heights greater than 183 cm, with the middle man being taller than the other two. In contrast, Team 2 only requires one man randomly surveyed to have a height taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, it is more probable for Team 2 to have recorded more days with a man taller than 183 cm. However, this is a statistical inference, and the actual results may vary based on the specific data collected.
