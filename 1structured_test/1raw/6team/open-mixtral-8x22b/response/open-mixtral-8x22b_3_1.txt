{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days. The reason is that Team 2 surveys one man per day who is taller than 183 cm if the man is taller than the 183 cm threshold. On the other hand, Team 1 needs to have two men taller than 183 cm and one shorter man for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of recording more days with men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
