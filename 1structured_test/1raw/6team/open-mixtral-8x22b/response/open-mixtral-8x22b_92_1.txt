{team: 2}

Explanation:

Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and the distribution of heights is symmetric (there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average), it can be inferred that the number of men taller than 183 cm is less than the number of men taller than 178 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men every day and counts the number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm. However, the probability of choosing a man taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of choosing a man taller than 178 cm, making it less likely that the middle man will be taller than 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys only one man every day and counts the number of days on which the height of the man is taller than 183 cm. Although they survey fewer men, they are still looking for the same characteristic (being taller than 183 cm) and have a similar probability of finding a man with that characteristic.

Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of counting more such days than Team 1.

Note: This analysis assumes that the distribution of heights is normal, and that the population is large enough to allow for a random sampling of men without replacement on a daily basis. If the distribution of heights is not normal or if the population is small, the results may differ.
