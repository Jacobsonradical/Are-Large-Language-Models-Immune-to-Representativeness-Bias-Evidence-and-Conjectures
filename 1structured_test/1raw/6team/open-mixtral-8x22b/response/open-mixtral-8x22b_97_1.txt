{team: 2}

Team 2 would likely have counted more such days than Team 1. The reason is that Team 2 is surveying one man each day who is taller than 183 cm, while Team 1 is looking for the middle man in a group of three to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, it would be less likely for the middle man in a group of three to be taller than 183 cm compared to just surveying one man from the population. Therefore, Team 2 would likely count more days than Team 1.
