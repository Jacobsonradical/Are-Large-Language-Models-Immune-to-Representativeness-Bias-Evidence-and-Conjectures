To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and how each team's method of data collection might affect their results. Given that the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume a roughly symmetric distribution of heights around the mean.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. The question asks for the number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm. This implies that on such days, at least two men surveyed by Team 1 would have a height greater than 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys only one man each day and counts the number of days on which the height of the man is taller than 183 cm.

To determine which team would record more such days, we need to compare the probabilities of the events described above. However, without specific information about the distribution of heights or the proportion of men taller than 183 cm, it is not possible to definitively conclude which team would record more such days.

Nevertheless, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided. Given that Team 1 requires at least two men to be taller than 183 cm on a given day, while Team 2 only requires one man, it is reasonable to assume that Team 2 would record more such days.

However, it is also important to consider that Team 1 surveys three men each day, which might increase their chances of finding men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2, who only surveys one man each day.

Taking all this into consideration, I would tentatively conclude that Team 2 is likely to have recorded more such days, but without concrete data, this remains a hypothesis.

So, the answer would be:
{team: 2}

However, this answer could change if we had more specific information about the height distribution in the population.
