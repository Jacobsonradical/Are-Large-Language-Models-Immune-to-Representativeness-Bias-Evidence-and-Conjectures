{team: 2}

Team 2 is expected to record more days with men taller than 183 cm. The reason for this is that Team 1 is surveying three men each day, but only one of them, the middle man, has a chance to be taller than 183 cm. On the other hand, Team 2 is surveying one man each day, and every man surveyed has a chance to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and assuming a normal distribution of heights, there will be fewer men taller than 183 cm compared to the total population. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of encountering a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1 does of encountering a middle man taller than 183 cm.
