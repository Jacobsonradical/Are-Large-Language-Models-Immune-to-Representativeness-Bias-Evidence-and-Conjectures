{team: 2}

My reasoning is that since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the distribution of heights in this population is likely to be symmetric around the mean. This means that the chance of a man being taller than 183 cm (5 cm above the mean) is relatively low.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them. Considering the distribution of heights, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is even lower than the probability of any single man being taller than 183 cm.

On the other hand, Team 2 surveys only one man each day, but the probability of that man being taller than 183 cm is still higher than the probability of the middle man in Team 1's survey being taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, I think Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm.
