{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.

Here's my reasoning:

Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, it can be inferred that the distribution of men's height is roughly symmetric around the average height.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. On any given day, the chance that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is relatively low, as this would require at least two of the three men to be taller than 183 cm. This is because the distribution of men's height is roughly symmetric around the average height, and 183 cm is significantly above the average height of 178 cm.

On the other hand, Team 2 surveys only one man each day. The chance that this one man is taller than 183 cm is higher than the chance that the middle man in Team 1's survey is taller than 183 cm. This is because, in Team 2's survey, only one man needs to be taller than 183 cm, whereas in Team 1's survey, at least two men need to be taller than 183 cm for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, I think Team 2 is more likely to record more days with men taller than 183 cm than Team 1.
