{team: 2}

Explanation:

The average height of men in the population is 178 cm. So, for a man to be taller than 183 cm, he must be taller than the average height. According to the information provided, there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1 is surveying three men every day, and they are counting the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. Since the height distribution is symmetric around the mean, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50% because the middle man could also be shorter than the average height.

On the other hand, Team 2 is surveying only one man every day, and they are counting the days when the man is taller than 183 cm. In this case, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is 50%, since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Therefore, Team 2 is expected to have a higher count of days when the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
