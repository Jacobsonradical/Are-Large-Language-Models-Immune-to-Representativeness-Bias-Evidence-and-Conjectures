{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. This is because they are surveying one man per day, and their criteria for inclusion is simply that the man is taller than 183 cm. In contrast, Team 1 is surveying three men per day and only counting the days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above the average height as below, the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean. This means that the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm (5 cm above the mean) is relatively low.

Therefore, even though Team 1 is surveying more men per day, the more stringent criteria for inclusion (the middle man being taller than 183 cm) makes it less likely for them to count a day than Team 2, which only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm.
