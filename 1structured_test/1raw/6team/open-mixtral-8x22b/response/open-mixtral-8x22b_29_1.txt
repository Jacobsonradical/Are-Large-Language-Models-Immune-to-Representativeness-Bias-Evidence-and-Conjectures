{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm, as they are surveying only one man each day, and there is a chance that the tallest of the three men surveyed by Team 1 could be taller than 183 cm. However, Team 1 only counts the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm, which is a more restrictive condition than the one faced by Team 2. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have a higher count of men taller than 183 cm.
