To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm in each scenario.

For Team 1, they are surveying three men each day and looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. Assuming that the heights follow a normal distribution, the probability of this happening depends on the standard deviation of heights. However, without this information, we can only make a rough estimate. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below, we can assume that the distribution is roughly symmetric around 178 cm. Therefore, a man being taller than 183 cm (5 cm above average) is relatively rare. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm would be even lower, as this would require at least two of the three men to be taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, they are surveying one man each day and looking for him to be taller than 183 cm. Again, this is relatively rare, but the probability is higher than for Team 1, as they only need one man to meet this criterion each day.

Without more specific information about the distribution of heights, it is difficult to determine exactly which team would count more such days. However, based on the information given, it seems more likely that Team 2 would count more such days, as they only need one man to meet the criterion each day, while Team 1 needs at least two out of three men to meet the criterion.

Therefore, my answer would be:
{team: 2}
