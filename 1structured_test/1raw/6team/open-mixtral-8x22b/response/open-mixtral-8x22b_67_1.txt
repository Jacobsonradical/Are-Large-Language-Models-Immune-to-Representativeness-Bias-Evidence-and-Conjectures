The question seems to require a probabilistic approach to determine which team would record more days with a man taller than 183 cm. However, without specific probabilities or a distribution of heights, it is difficult to provide an exact answer.

That being said, intuitively, we might expect Team 2 to record more days with a man taller than 183 cm. This is because every day, Team 2 is surveying the tallest man out of a sample of one, while Team 1 is surveying the middle man out of a sample of three. Since the average height is 178 cm, it is more likely for a single person to be taller than 183 cm than it is for the middle person in a group of three to be taller than 183 cm.

However, this is a simplification and the actual result could be different depending on the distribution of heights in the population. If there is a high concentration of men around the average height, Team 2 might have a lower chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1.

In conclusion, based on the information given, I would tentatively suggest that Team 2 might record more such days, but this is not guaranteed and could vary based on the actual distribution of heights in the population.
