{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days. The reason for this is that Team 2 surveys one man per day, and this man can be of any height, so there's a chance that the man can be taller than 183 cm. On the other hand, Team 1 ranks three men per day, and only the middle man's height is considered. If the three men surveyed by Team 1 have heights above the average, there's still a chance that the middle man is below 183 cm. Given that the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, it's more probable that Team 2 will count more days with men taller than 183 cm.
