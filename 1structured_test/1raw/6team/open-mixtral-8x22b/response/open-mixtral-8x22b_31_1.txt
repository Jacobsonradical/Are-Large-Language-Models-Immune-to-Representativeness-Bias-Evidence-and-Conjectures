{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. The reasoning is as follows:

Team 1 surveys three men each day and records the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men taller than average as there are men shorter than average, it's less likely to find a man taller than 183 cm in the middle position, as the team could have picked two men shorter than 183 cm and one taller, or all three men could be shorter than 183 cm.

Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man each day and records the days when that man is taller than 183 cm. The probability of picking a man taller than 183 cm is higher since they're not constrained by the middle position requirement.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to record more days with men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
