{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days. The reason is that Team 2 surveys one man per day and counts the days when the height is above 183 cm. On the other hand, Team 1 surveys three men each day and only counts the days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm. Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average height as below, the likelihood of the middle man being above 183 cm is lower than the likelihood of any one man being above 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is expected to record more days with men taller than 183 cm.
