{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more such days. Here's why:

Since the average height of men is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean. This means that the number of men taller than 183 cm is less than the number of men between 178 cm and 183 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and only counts days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, both of the other two men surveyed would also need to be taller than 183 cm, since there are as many men taller as there are shorter than average. This means that Team 1 is less likely to count a day as having a man taller than 183 cm, compared to Team 2.

Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man each day and counts any day where that man is taller than 183 cm. This means that Team 2 is more likely to count a day as having a man taller than 183 cm, compared to Team 1.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have recorded more such days than Team 1.
