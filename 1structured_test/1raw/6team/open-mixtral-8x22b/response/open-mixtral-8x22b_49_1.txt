{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 surveys one man every day, which means they are sampling from the entire population of men each time. Team 1, on the other hand, only surveys three men a day, and the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of any man in Team 2's sample being taller than 183 cm.

However, this is a probabilistic answer and actual results may vary depending on the distribution of heights in the population.
