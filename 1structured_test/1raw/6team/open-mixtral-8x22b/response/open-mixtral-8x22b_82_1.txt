{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 is surveying one man per day, and the average height is around 178 cm, so men taller than 183 cm (5 cm above the average) are still relatively common.

Team 1, on the other hand, surveys three men per day and only records the day if the middle man is taller than 183 cm. This means that not only must one man be taller than 183 cm, but also that he must be taller than at least one other man surveyed that day. This adds an extra condition, making it less likely for Team 1 to record a day than Team 2.

However, this is a simplified explanation and the actual results could vary depending on the height distribution in the population. But, based on the information provided, Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.
