{team: 1}

Team 1 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. This is because they survey three men each day instead of one, and rank them by height. The middle man in this ranking is more likely to be taller than 183 cm, as this rank includes both men who are taller than the average height (178 cm) and men who are shorter but still taller than the third man in the ranking. In comparison, Team 2 only surveys one man each day, so the chances of that man being taller than 183 cm are lower.
