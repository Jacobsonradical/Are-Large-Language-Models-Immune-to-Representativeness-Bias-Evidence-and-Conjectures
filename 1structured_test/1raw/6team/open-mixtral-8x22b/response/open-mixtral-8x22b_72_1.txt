{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days. The reason is that Team 1 has a higher threshold for counting a day as a "taller than average" day. They only count a day if the middle man of the three is taller than 183 cm, which is a more stringent condition than just being taller than the average height of 178 cm. On the other hand, Team 2 counts a day as long as the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm. Since both teams are surveying randomly, Team 2's method will capture more instances where the man is taller than 183 cm. However, this is an estimation based on the given information and the actual results could vary due to the randomness of the sampling.
