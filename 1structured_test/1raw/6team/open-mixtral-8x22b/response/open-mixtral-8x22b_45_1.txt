{team: 2}

Team 2 would likely have recorded more such days. The reason is that Team 1 is only recording instances where the middle-height man is taller than 183 cm, whereas Team 2 is recording every instance where the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, it is more likely that Team 2 will find a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1 finding a man taller than 183 cm specifically in the middle rank of their three surveyed men.

However, this is a statistical prediction and the actual results could vary depending on the specific distribution of heights in the population.
