{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days. Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean.

When Team 1 surveys three men each day, they are more likely to have at least one man whose height is below 183 cm and at least one man whose height is above 183 cm, making it less likely for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm.

On the other hand, when Team 2 surveys only one man each day, they have a higher chance of selecting a man who is taller than 183 cm, since there are still many men taller than 183 cm in the population.

Therefore, I think Team 2 recorded more such days.
