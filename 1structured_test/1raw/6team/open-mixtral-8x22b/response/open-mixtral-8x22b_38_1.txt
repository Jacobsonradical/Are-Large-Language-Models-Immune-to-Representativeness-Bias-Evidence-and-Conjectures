{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. The reasoning is as follows:

1. Both teams are surveying men from the same population, which has an average height of 178 cm for men.
2. The height of 183 cm is 5 cm above the average height, which is relatively high considering the distribution of heights in a population.
3. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them based on their height. However, since heights are normally distributed around the mean, it is less likely for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm compared to a single man surveyed by Team 2.
4. Team 2 surveys only one man each day, but their chances of finding a man taller than 183 cm are higher than Team 1's chances of finding the middle man taller than 183 cm from their three daily surveys.
5. Therefore, it is more likely for Team 2 to record a higher number of days with men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
