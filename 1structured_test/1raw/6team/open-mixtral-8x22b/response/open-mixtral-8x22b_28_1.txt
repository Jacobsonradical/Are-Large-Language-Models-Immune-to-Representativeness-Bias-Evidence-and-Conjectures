{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days.

Here's the reasoning:

1. The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
2. The middle man from Team 1's survey must be taller than 183 cm, which is 5 cm above the average.
3. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, it can be inferred that only a fraction of the men are taller than 183 cm.
4. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them, so the middle man must be taller than 183 cm for it to count. This means that the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of any one man being taller than 183 cm.
5. Team 2 surveys only one man each day, and they count the days when that man is taller than 183 cm. This means that the probability of counting a day is higher for Team 2 than for Team 1.
6. Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days than Team 1.

It's also worth noting that the question asks if the two teams' counts are within 5% of each other. Given the difference in the probabilities for Team 1 and Team 2, it is unlikely that their counts would be within 5% of each other.
