{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Both teams are surveying randomly from the same population, where the average height is around 178 cm.
2. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm, given that the heights are evenly distributed around the average.
3. Team 2 surveys only one man each day. For this man to be taller than 183 cm, only one man needs to meet this criterion.
4. Since Team 1 needs at least two men out of three to be taller than 183 cm, while Team 2 needs only one man out of one, the probability of Team 2 recording more days where the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm is higher.
5. Furthermore, since the number of men whose height is above average is equal to the number of men whose height is below average, it is less likely for Team 1 to consistently find three men with heights above 183 cm than for Team 2 to find one man with a height above 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more such days.
