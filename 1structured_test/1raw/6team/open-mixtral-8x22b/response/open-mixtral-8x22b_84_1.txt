{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning behind my answer:

1. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. They count the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm.
2. Since the average height is 178 cm and the population is symmetrically distributed around the average, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is relatively small.
3. For Team 1 to count a day, the second tallest man out of three must be taller than 183 cm. This means that at least two of the three men surveyed by Team 1 need to be taller than 183 cm for that day to be counted.
4. Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man each day and counts the days when that man is taller than 183 cm. This means that Team 2 only needs one man out of three to be taller than 183 cm for a day to be counted.
5. Since both teams are sampling from the same population and Team 2 has a lower threshold for counting a day, it is more likely that Team 2 will count more such days than Team 1.

Therefore, I believe that Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.
