{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. The reasoning behind this is that Team 2 surveys one man per day, so they have a higher chance of selecting a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1, who might end up with two shorter men in their survey of three, making the middle man less likely to be taller than 183 cm. This difference is not expected to be within 5% of each other since the likelihood of selecting a taller man in Team 2 is much higher than the likelihood in Team 1.
