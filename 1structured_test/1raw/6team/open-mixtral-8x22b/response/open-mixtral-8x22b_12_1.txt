{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more such days. The reason is that Team 1, surveying three men each day and picking the middle man's height, is more likely to select a man closer to the average height due to the nature of the ranking. On the other hand, Team 2, surveying just one man each day, has an equal chance of selecting a man taller or shorter than the average. Since the average height is around 178 cm, and Team 2 is looking for men taller than 183 cm, they are more likely to find such men than Team 1. Team 1's selection process inherently makes it less likely for them to select men significantly taller than the average, as such men would not typically be the "middle" man in a group of three randomly selected men.
