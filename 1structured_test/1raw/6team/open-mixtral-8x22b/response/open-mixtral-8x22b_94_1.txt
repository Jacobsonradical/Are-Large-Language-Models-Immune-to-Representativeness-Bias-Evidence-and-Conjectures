{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. Although Team 1 surveys more men each day, they only count the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm, which is a more stringent condition than just the man being taller than 183 cm.

Since both teams are sampling from the same population, and assuming that the distribution of heights is roughly symmetric with a mean of 178 cm, there will be fewer men taller than 183 cm compared to the total population. This means that Team 1 will have fewer opportunities to count a day as meeting their criteria, while Team 2 will count any day where a man is taller than 183 cm, regardless of their height relative to other men surveyed that day.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 will have recorded more such days. However, this is a probabilistic analysis and the actual results could vary due to random sampling.
