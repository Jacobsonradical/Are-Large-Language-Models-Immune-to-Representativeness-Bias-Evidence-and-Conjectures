{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days. Since they survey only one man per day and that man's height only needs to exceed 183 cm, they have a higher chance of recording a taller-than-183-cm man compared to Team 1.

Team 1, on the other hand, surveys three men per day and only counts the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. This means that there are additional conditions that need to be met in order for Team 1 to record a day with a taller-than-183-cm man.

Therefore, it is more probable that Team 2 recorded more such days than Team 1.
