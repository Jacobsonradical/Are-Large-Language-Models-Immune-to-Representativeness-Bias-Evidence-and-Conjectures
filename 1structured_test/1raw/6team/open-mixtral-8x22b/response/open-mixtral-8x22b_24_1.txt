{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. Although both teams are sampling from the same population, Team 2 is specifically looking for men who are taller than average (178 cm) and even more so (183 cm), while Team 1 is looking at the middle height of three randomly selected men. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are below average, Team 1 has a higher probability of selecting men shorter than 183 cm as the middle height. On the other hand, Team 2 has a better chance of identifying men taller than 183 cm since they are focusing on just one man each day.
