{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 surveys more men in total (365 men), compared to Team 1 which only surveys the middle man each day (122 men, since only the middle man is considered). Since each day's selection is independent, Team 2 has a higher probability of finding men taller than 183 cm than Team 1.

However, this is a prediction based on the given information and does not account for any other factors or variability in the data. It is also important to note that the actual numbers may vary depending on the specific distribution of heights in the population.

In general, if the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean, we would expect Team 1 and Team 2 to find similar proportions of men taller than 183 cm, but the larger sample size of Team 2 gives it an advantage in finding more such men.

To determine if they are within 5% of each other, we would need more information about the distribution of heights and the actual counts recorded by each team.
