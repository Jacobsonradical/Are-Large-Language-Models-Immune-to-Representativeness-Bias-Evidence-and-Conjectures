{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days. Since they are surveying one man per day, they have a higher chance of selecting a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1, which surveys three men per day and selects the middle one. The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm in Team 1 is lower because the middle man may not always be taller than 183 cm, while in Team 2, every man surveyed has a chance to be taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is expected to record more such days than Team 1.
