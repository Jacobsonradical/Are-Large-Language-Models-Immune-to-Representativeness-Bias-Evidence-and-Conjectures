{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. This is based on the assumption that the distribution of heights is roughly symmetrical around the mean (178 cm), with an equal number of men taller and shorter than the average. Since 183 cm is above the average, there will be fewer men in the population taller than 183 cm than those who are shorter than 183 cm. In Team 1's case, they are looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, which is less likely than Team 2 finding just one man taller than 183 cm.

However, without knowing the exact distribution of heights in the population, it is impossible to determine the exact difference between the two teams' counts or to guarantee that they are not within 5% of each other. Nonetheless, based on the given information, Team 2 is the more probable choice.
