{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.

Here's the reasoning:

Let's first consider the distribution of heights in the population. Given that the average height is around 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume a somewhat normal distribution of heights.

For Team 1, they survey three men each day and rank them according to their height. Since they are only counting the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm, this means that both the shortest and tallest men surveyed on those days are also taller than 183 cm. This is a more restrictive condition than Team 2's method, which only requires one man to be taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, they survey only one man each day, so as long as the man they survey is taller than 183 cm, they count that day. This means they have a higher probability of counting a day than Team 1, given the same population distribution.

Based on these considerations, I think Team 2 would have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.
