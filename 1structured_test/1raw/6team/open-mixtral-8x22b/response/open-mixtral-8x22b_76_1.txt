{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with men taller than 183 cm than Team 1. Since Team 2 surveys one man per day and does not rank them, they have a higher chance of selecting men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1 which ranks three men per day and only counts the middle man. Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below, the likelihood of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is relatively low. However, since Team 2 has more opportunities (one per day) to select such men, they are likely to have counted a higher number of days with men taller than 183 cm.
