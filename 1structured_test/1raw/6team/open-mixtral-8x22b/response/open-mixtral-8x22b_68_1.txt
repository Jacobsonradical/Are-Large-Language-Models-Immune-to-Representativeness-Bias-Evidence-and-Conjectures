{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. Since they are only surveying one man per day, they have a higher chance of surveying a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1, which is surveying three men per day and only counting the days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm.

Even though the average height is around 178 cm, there is still a chance for men to be taller than 183 cm, and since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, Team 2 has a higher chance of surveying a man taller than 183 cm on any given day compared to Team 1.

Therefore, I predict that Team 2 recorded more such days.
