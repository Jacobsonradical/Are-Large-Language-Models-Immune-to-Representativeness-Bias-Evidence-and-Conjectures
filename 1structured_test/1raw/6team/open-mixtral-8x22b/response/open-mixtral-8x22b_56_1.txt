{team: 2}

Explanation:

Let's denote the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm as P(Taller than 183 cm).

Since Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height, the middle man being taller than 183 cm would mean that at least two men are taller than 183 cm.

Assuming the distribution of men's heights is approximately normal, with a mean of 178 cm and equal numbers of men above and below the average height, it is reasonable to assume that the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm (which is 5 cm above the average) is around 0.5.

However, for Team 1 to count a day as a success, they need at least two men to be taller than 183 cm. The probability of this happening can be calculated as follows:

P(At least 2 men taller than 183 cm) = P(Exactly 2 men taller than 183 cm) + P(All 3 men taller than 183 cm)
= 3 * P(Taller than 183 cm)^2 * (1 - P(Taller than 183 cm)) + P(Taller than 183 cm)^3
= 3 * 0.5^2 * (1 - 0.5) + 0.5^3
≈ 0.375

Now, let's calculate the expected number of days Team 1 counts as a success:

Expected number of days for Team 1 = 365 * P(At least 2 men taller than 183 cm)
≈ 365 * 0.375
≈ 136.875

For Team 2, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm on any given day is simply P(Taller than 183 cm), which we assumed to be around 0.5.

Expected number of days for Team 2 = 365 * P(Taller than 183 cm)
≈ 365 * 0.5
≈ 182.5

Comparing the expected number of days for both teams, Team 2 is expected to count more days with men taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, based on this analysis, I would choose {team: 2} as the answer.
