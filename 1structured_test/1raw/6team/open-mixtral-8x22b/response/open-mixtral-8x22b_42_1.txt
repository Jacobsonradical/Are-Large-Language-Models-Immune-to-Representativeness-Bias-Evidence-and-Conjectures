{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. For the middle man's height to be more than 183 cm, it would mean that at least two out of three men surveyed that day are taller than 183 cm, which is a more stringent condition.

2. Team 2 surveys only one man each day. For Team 2 to record a day with a man taller than 183 cm, just that one man needs to be taller than 183 cm, making it a less stringent condition.

3. Given that the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is probably less than 50%.

4. Therefore, it would be more likely for Team 2 to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm since they only need one man per day to meet the criterion, as opposed to Team 1, which needs at least two out of three men per day to meet the criterion.

5. So, the answer is Team 2 recorded more such days.
