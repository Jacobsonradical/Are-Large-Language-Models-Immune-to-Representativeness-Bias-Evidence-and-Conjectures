To answer this question, we need to compare the probability of each team recording a man taller than 183 cm each day and then multiply it by the number of days.

For Team 1, they are surveying three men each day. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as there are below average, we can assume the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean. However, without a specific distribution (e.g., normal distribution), we can't calculate the exact probability. But we can estimate that the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 1/2, as the middle man's height is not guaranteed to be the tallest among the three.

For Team 2, since they are surveying only one man each day, the probability of that man being taller than 183 cm is also less than 1/2, as the average height is 178 cm.

Without knowing the exact distribution of heights, we can't definitively say which team will record more days with men taller than 183 cm. However, since Team 1 is surveying three men each day and only counting the middle man if he is taller than 183 cm, they might have a slightly higher chance of recording more such days compared to Team 2, who is only surveying one man each day. But this difference might not be significant enough to confidently say Team 1 will record more days.

Given the information, I would guess that they are about the same (within 5% of each other). But this is only a guess based on the given information.
