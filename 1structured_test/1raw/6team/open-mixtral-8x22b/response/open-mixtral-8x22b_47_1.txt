{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more such days. The reasoning behind this is that Team 2 surveys one man each day who is taller than 183 cm with a probability that depends on the distribution of heights in the population. However, Team 1 surveys three men each day and only counts a day as valid if the middle man is taller than 183 cm.

Assuming the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean (178 cm), there is a lower probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm than any man in the sample being taller than 183 cm. This is because for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two men in the sample must be taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 1's method introduces additional constraints that make it less likely to record a valid day compared to Team 2.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Team 2 will record more such days than Team 1. However, the exact probability would depend on the specific distribution of heights in the population.
