{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days where the height of the man was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 is surveying one man per day, and this man can be of any height from the population, including those in the upper range. Team 1, on the other hand, is ranking three men each day and only counting the days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of any one man being taller than 183 cm, as in Team 2's case. Therefore, it is expected that Team 2 would record more such days.
