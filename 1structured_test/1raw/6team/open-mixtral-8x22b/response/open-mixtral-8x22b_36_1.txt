{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.

Here's my reasoning:

1. Both teams are surveying men from the same population with the same average height (178 cm) and height distribution.

2. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. The question asks for the number of days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm. This means that on those days, at least two men must be taller than 183 cm.

3. Team 2 surveys only one man each day and counts the days when the man is taller than 183 cm. This means that on those days, one man is taller than 183 cm.

4. Since the average height is 178 cm, men taller than 183 cm are in the upper tail of the height distribution. There are likely fewer men in this height range compared to the entire population.

5. Given the height distribution, it is more likely for Team 2 to find one man taller than 183 cm each day than it is for Team 1 to find two or more men taller than 183 cm each day.

6. Therefore, I think Team 2 will have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.
