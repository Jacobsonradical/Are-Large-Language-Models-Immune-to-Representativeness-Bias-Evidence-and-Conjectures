{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. The reasoning behind this is that Team 1, which surveys three men per day, will only count a day as positive if the middle man is taller than 183 cm. This means that even if both of the other men are also taller than 183 cm, the day will only be counted once.

On the other hand, Team 2 surveys only one man per day, but every man they survey who is taller than 183 cm will be counted. Since there are as many men whose height is above average (178 cm) as there are below average, it is reasonable to assume that there are enough men taller than 183 cm to make Team 2's count higher than Team 1's.

Additionally, since Team 1 ranks the men and only counts the middle man, there is a chance that they will miss counting men taller than 183 cm if they happen to be the shortest or tallest of the three men surveyed on a given day. Team 2, however, does not have this issue, as they count every man they survey who is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm.
