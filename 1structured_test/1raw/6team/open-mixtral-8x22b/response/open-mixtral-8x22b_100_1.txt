{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. The reason for this is that Team 1's method of ranking three men each day and then only considering the middle man introduces a bias towards the average height. On the other hand, Team 2's method of surveying one man each day will give a more representative sample of the overall population's height distribution. Given that there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, and the average height is 178 cm, Team 2 is more likely to encounter men taller than 183 cm on a regular basis, compared to Team 1's method of only considering the middle-ranked man.
