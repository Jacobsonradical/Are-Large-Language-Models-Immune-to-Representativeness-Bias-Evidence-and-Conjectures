{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more such days.

Here's my reasoning:

For Team 1, each day they survey three men and rank them. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, it's necessary that at least two men are taller than 183 cm. Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as there are below average, it's less likely to find two men taller than 183 cm than finding one man taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, each day they survey only one man. Their count will be higher than Team 1's, since they don't have the additional requirement of needing two men taller than 183 cm to have a "tall" middle man.

So, Team 2 will likely have a higher count of days where the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.
