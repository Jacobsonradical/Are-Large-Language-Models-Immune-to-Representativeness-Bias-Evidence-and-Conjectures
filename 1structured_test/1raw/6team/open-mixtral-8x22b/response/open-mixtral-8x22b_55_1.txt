{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. The reasoning behind this is that Team 2 is surveying one man per day, and the man can be of any height. Since there are as many men taller than the average height as there are men shorter than the average height, the probability of Team 2 finding a man taller than 183 cm is higher than Team 1 finding a man in the middle position taller than 183 cm. Team 1 is only counting days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm, which is a more specific condition than Team 2's condition. Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 will have a higher count.
