{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days. Here's why:

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, the tallest man would also have to be taller than 183 cm. This means that the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of just one man being taller than 183 cm.

Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man each day. The probability of this one man being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of the middle man in Team 1's survey being taller than 183 cm.

So, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days. However, without the exact distribution of heights in the population, it's not possible to definitively say that Team 2 will always count more such days. But based on the given information, Team 2 is the more likely answer.
