{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Both teams are looking for men taller than 183 cm, which is 5 cm taller than the average height of men in the population.
2. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them. They count the number of days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm. However, for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two men must be taller than 183 cm (since the middle man is the second tallest among the three).
3. Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man each day and counts the days where that man is taller than 183 cm. This means they only need to find one man taller than 183 cm each day, which is a lower threshold compared to Team 1.
4. Since the average height is 178 cm, there are fewer men who are 5 cm or more taller than the average. This makes it more likely for Team 2 to find men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1, which requires at least two men to be taller than 183 cm.
5. Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days.
