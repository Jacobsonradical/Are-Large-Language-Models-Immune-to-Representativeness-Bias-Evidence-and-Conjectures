To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions about the distribution of heights in the population. Since we know that the average height is around 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the distribution of heights is roughly symmetric around the mean.

Let's assume that the distribution of heights is normal (Gaussian) with mean 178 cm and standard deviation σ. Without loss of generality, we can assume that σ = 15 cm, which is a reasonable value for the standard deviation of adult male heights.

Now, let's calculate the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm. This can be done using the standard normal distribution table, which gives the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a standard normal distribution (mean 0, standard deviation 1).

Let Z = (X - μ) / σ be the standardized height, where X is the height of a randomly selected man and μ = 178 cm is the mean height. Then, the probability that X > 183 cm is the same as the probability that Z > (183 - 178) / 15 = 0.33. Using the standard normal distribution table, we find that P(Z > 0.33) ≈ 0.37.

Now, let's calculate the expected number of days on which the height of the man surveyed by Team 2 is taller than 183 cm. Since each day is independent, this is simply the product of the probability of the event and the number of days: E(Team 2) = 365 × 0.37 ≈ 135.

Next, let's calculate the expected number of days on which the height of the middle man surveyed by Team 1 is taller than 183 cm. Since Team 1 surveys three men each day, there are six possible rankings of the three men with respect to their height (123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321), each of which is equally likely. The probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm depends on the rankings:

* If the middle man is the tallest (ranking 321), then the probability is 0.37, as we calculated before.
* If the middle man is the second tallest (ranking 231 or 312), then the probability is 0.37 × (2/3) = 0.247, since the tallest man must also be taller than 183 cm.
* If the middle man is the shortest (ranking 132 or 213), then the probability is 0.37 × (1/3) = 0.123, since both the tallest and the second tallest man must be taller than 183 cm.

The expected number of days on which the height of the middle man surveyed by Team 1 is taller than 183 cm is then:
E(Team 1) = 365 × (0.37 × 2/6 + 0.247 × 2/6 + 0.123 × 2/6) ≈ 102.

Therefore, Team 2 is expected to count more such days than Team 1. However, since the actual number of days counted by each team will vary due to sampling variability, it is possible that Team 1 could count more such days than Team 2 in a particular realization of the experiment.

To answer the question, we need to consider the variability in the number of such days counted by each team. Since the number of such days counted by Team 1 is based on six independent events each day (the rankings of the three men), while the number of such days counted by Team 2 is based on a single independent event each day, the variability in the number of such days counted by Team 2 will be larger than that of Team 1.

Therefore, we can expect that the number of such days counted by Team 1 will be within 5% of the number of such days counted by Team 2 with a higher probability than the other way around.

Thus, the answer is:
{team: 3}
