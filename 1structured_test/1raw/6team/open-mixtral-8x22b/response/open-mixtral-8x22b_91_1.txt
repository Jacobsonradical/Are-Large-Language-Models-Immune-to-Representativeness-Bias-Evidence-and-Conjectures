{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days because even though both teams are sampling from the same population, Team 1 is only counting days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. This means that if the tallest man in Team 1's sample is not in the middle, they will not be counted. On the other hand, Team 2 is counting every man they survey who is taller than 183 cm, regardless of their position in the sample. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of counting more men who are taller than 183 cm.
