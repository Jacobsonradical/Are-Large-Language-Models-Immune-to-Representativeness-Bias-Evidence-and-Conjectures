To answer this question, let's consider the distribution of heights in the population. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can infer that the distribution is roughly symmetric around the mean.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two of the three men must be taller than 183 cm. This means that Team 1's count includes days when two or three men are taller than 183 cm.

Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man each day. For Team 2 to record a day, the man surveyed must be taller than 183 cm.

Given the symmetry of the height distribution, it is more likely that on any given day, only one of the three men surveyed by Team 1 will be taller than 183 cm. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Team 2 will record more days when the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

However, it is important to note that this is a probabilistic argument and depends on the exact shape of the height distribution. In practice, the two teams' counts could be closer or farther apart depending on the variability of heights within the population.

Based on the information provided and the above reasoning, my answer is:

{team: 2}

That is, I think Team 2 recorded more such days. However, it is worth noting that without more specific information about the height distribution, it is not possible to definitively determine if the two teams' counts are within 5% of each other.
