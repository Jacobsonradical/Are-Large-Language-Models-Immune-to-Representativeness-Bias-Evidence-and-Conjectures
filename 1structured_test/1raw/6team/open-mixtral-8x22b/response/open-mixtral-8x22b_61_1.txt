{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with a man taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 surveys one man per day, and that man could be any height within the population distribution. Since the average height is 178 cm, there will be a significant number of men taller than 183 cm.

On the other hand, Team 1 surveys three men per day and only considers the middle man's height. Given that heights are normally distributed around the mean, the middle man will have a height closer to the average (178 cm) rather than an outlier. Therefore, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of any one man being taller than 183 cm (as in Team 2's method).

This reasoning assumes that both teams are surveying from the same population with the same distribution of heights. If there are significant differences in the populations being surveyed or in the methods used to select individuals for surveying, the conclusion might be different. However, based on the information given, Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
