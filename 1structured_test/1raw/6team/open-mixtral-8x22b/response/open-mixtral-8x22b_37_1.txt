{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. The reasoning behind this is that Team 1 is always selecting the middle height out of three men, which inherently means that they are not necessarily selecting the tallest men available. Team 2, on the other hand, is selecting just one man each day, but they are not limited to choosing the middle height out of a group of three. Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 will encounter more men taller than 183 cm in their daily surveys.
