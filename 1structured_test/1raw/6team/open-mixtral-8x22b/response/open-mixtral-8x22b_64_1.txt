{team: 2}

I think Team 2 recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm. The reason for this is that Team 2 surveys one man per day, and there is a higher probability of picking a man taller than 183 cm from the population compared to Team 1, who has to pick three men taller than 183 cm (with the middle man being taller than 183 cm) from the population. The constraint on Team 1 makes it less likely for them to record as many days as Team 2.
