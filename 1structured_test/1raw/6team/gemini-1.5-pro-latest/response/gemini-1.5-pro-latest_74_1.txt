Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. This means the middle person needs to be taller than 183cm, and at least one person in the group needs to be shorter.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* randomly selected person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

Team 1 has a lower probability of success each day. Here's why:

* For Team 1 to count a day, they need one person shorter, one person taller, and one person in the middle who is *specifically* taller than 183cm. 
* Team 2 just needs their single selection to be taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height requirement was met.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
