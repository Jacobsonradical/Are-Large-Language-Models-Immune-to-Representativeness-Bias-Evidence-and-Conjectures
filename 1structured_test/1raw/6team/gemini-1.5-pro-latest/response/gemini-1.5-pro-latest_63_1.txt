Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person in a group of three. Their count increases only if the middle person's height is above 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Has a simpler approach, counting days where the single person surveyed is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

The key here is that the average height is 178cm, and the height distribution is symmetrical (equal numbers above and below the average). This means:

* There's a lower probability of finding *one* person significantly taller than average (183cm).
* There's an even lower probability of the *middle person* in a group of three being significantly taller than average. 

**Why Team 2 is More Likely**

Team 2 is more likely to have a higher count because they have more opportunities for their single surveyed individual to be taller than 183cm. Team 1's count is restricted by needing the middle person in a group of three to meet the height requirement.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
