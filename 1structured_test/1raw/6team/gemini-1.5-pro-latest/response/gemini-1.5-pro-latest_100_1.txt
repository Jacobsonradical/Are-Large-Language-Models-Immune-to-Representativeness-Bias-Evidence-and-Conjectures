Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  This means they only count days where the middle person is unusually tall (above 183 cm).
* **Team 2:**  Has a simpler criterion â€“ they only care if the single person they surveyed is above 183 cm.

**Logic**

Since 183 cm is significantly above the average height (178 cm), it's less likely for Team 1 to have a middle person above that height. Team 2, on the other hand, has a higher chance of encountering someone above 183 cm since they are looking at individuals without the constraint of a middle height.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 likely counted more days where the height exceeded 183 cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
