Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. Their count increases only if the middle person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:** Focuses on whether a *single* person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178cm and there's an even distribution above and below, there's a significant portion of the population shorter than 183cm. 

Team 1's count is limited by the middle person. For the middle person to be taller than 183cm, at least two out of the three people surveyed that day need to be taller than 183cm. This is less likely than just one person being taller than 183cm (Team 2's criteria).

**Answer**

Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height is greater than 183cm.

**Format:**

```json
{
"team": 2
}
```
