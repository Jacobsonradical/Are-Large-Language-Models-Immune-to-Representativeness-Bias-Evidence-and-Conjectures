{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

While it might seem like Team 1 would have more days with a middle man over 183cm because they're sampling three men, the probabilities even out. Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  For the middle man to be over 183cm, at least two out of the three men sampled must be taller than 183cm.  
* **Team 2:**  They have a direct 1 in however many chance of finding someone over 183cm each day.

Since the men are chosen randomly, and the population has a relatively even distribution of heights above and below average, the chances of Team 1 finding two men over 183cm on a given day is roughly the same as Team 2 finding one man over 183cm. Over 365 days, the results would be very similar, within 5% of each other.
