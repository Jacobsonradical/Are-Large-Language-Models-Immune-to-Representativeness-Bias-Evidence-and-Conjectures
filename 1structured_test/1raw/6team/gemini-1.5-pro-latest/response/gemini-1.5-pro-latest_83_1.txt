Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They are more likely to find someone taller than 183cm than if they were just picking one person at random (like Team 2). This is because they have a higher chance of having at least one very tall person in their group of three.
* **Team 2:**  Has a straightforward approach: is the single person they pick taller than 183cm?

**Logic**

Since 183cm is above the average height, and the population is evenly distributed above and below the average, it's less likely to find someone taller than 183cm randomly.  Team 1's method increases their chances of having at least one person taller than 183cm in their smaller sample.

**Answer**

{team: 1}
