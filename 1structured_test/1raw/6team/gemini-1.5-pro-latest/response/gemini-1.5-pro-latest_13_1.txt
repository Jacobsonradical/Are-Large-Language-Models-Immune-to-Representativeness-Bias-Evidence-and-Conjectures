Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They record days where the middle person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on individual heights. They record days where the single person surveyed is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

The key is recognizing that Team 1's method biases towards taller individuals.  Here's why:

* **Team 1:** For the middle person to be taller than 183cm, at least two out of the three people surveyed that day need to be taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:** They only need to find one person taller than 183cm.

Since the population has an equal distribution of heights above and below the average, it's less likely to find two people taller than 183cm (Team 1) compared to finding just one (Team 2).

**Answer**

{team: 2} 

**Explanation:** Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height was taller than 183cm because their method doesn't rely on finding multiple tall individuals in a smaller sample.
