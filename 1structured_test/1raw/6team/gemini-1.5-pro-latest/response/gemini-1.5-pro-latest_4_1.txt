Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They count days where the middle person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on a *single* person's height. They count days where that person is taller than 183cm.

**Reasoning**

* Since the average height of men is 178cm, and the distribution is symmetrical around the average, finding someone taller than 183cm is relatively uncommon. 
* Team 1 is looking for the middle person to be taller than 183cm. This means *at least two* out of the three people surveyed that day must be taller than 183cm. This is less likely than finding just one person taller than 183cm (Team 2's approach).

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height exceeded 183cm because they have a higher probability of finding at least one person who meets the criteria in each individual survey.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
