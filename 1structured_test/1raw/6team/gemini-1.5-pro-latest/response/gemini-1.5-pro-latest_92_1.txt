Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They record days where the middle height exceeds 183 cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on *individual* heights. They record days where the single person's height exceeds 183 cm.

**Logic**

The key is recognizing that Team 1's method biases towards taller individuals. For the middle person in a group of three to be taller than 183 cm, it's more likely that at least one of the other two people is also quite tall. 

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is simply looking at the probability of a single person being taller than 183 cm. This probability is likely to be lower than the probability of Team 1's scenario (where the middle person in a group of three is taller).

**Answer**

{team: 2}
