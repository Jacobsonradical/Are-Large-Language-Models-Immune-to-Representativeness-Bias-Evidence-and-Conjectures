Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They record days where this middle person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on the height of a *single* person each day. They record days where this person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

The key here is that the average height is 178cm, and the distribution is symmetrical (equal number of men above and below average). This means:

*  It's relatively likely to find one person taller than 183cm.
* It's less likely that the *middle person* in a group of three will be taller than 183cm. This is because for the middle person to be that tall, you'd need at least two people out of the three to be unusually tall.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height exceeded 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
