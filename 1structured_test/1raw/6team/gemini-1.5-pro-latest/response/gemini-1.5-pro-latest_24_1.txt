Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They have more chances to find someone above 183cm in a single day's sampling, but it's not guaranteed the middle person will always be above that height.
* **Team 2:** Focuses on individual heights. They have a direct measurement of whether someone is above 183cm.

**Reasoning**

Since the average height is 178cm and the distribution is symmetrical, the probability of finding someone taller than 183cm is going to be less than 50%. 

Team 1, by looking at the middle person in a group of three, is essentially trying to shift their odds closer to the average.  While they have more chances to encounter someone above 183cm each day,  the requirement that the *middle* person be above that height makes it less likely.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a person taller than 183cm because they are directly measuring against that threshold.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
