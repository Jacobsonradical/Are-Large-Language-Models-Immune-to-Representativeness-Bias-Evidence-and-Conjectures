Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. For the middle person to be over 183cm, at least two out of the three people surveyed that day must be taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* randomly selected person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

It's less likely to find two people taller than 183cm in a random group of three than it is to find one person taller than 183cm in a random selection of one. 

**Therefore:**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height exceeded 183cm.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
