Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They'll count a day if that middle person is taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* person is taller than 183 cm.

**Reasoning**

* **Distribution of Heights:** The problem states the average height is 178 cm with an even distribution above and below. This means there's a good chance of finding people both taller and shorter than 183 cm in the population.
* **Team 1's Probability:** For Team 1 to count a day, the middle person in their group of three needs to be taller than 183 cm.  This is less likely than simply finding *one* person taller than 183 cm (Team 2's task). 
* **Team 2's Probability:** Team 2 has a higher probability of counting a day because they only need to find one person meeting the height criteria.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 likely counted more days.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
