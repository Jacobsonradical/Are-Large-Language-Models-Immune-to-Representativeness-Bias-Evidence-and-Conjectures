{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams are likely to have counts within 5% of each other:

* **Probability Focus:**  The core of the problem is about the probability of a man in the population being taller than 183cm. Both teams are ultimately gathering data to estimate this probability.
* **Sample Size:** Team 1 surveys more men per day, but Team 2 surveys consistently over the entire year.  In the long run, both teams end up with a large sample size, making their results likely to converge towards the true probability.
* **Randomness:** The random selection of men each day is crucial. This ensures that the height variations in the population are evenly represented in both teams' data over time.

**While Team 1 might have slightly more variation due to the ranking system, over 365 days, the law of large numbers suggests that both teams' results should closely reflect the actual proportion of men taller than 183cm in the population.**
