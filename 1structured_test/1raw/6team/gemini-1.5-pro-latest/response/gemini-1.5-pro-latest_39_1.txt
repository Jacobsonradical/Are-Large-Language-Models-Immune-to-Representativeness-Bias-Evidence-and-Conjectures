{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams are likely to have counts within 5% of each other:

* **Probability Focus:** The problem ultimately revolves around the probability of a man from the population being taller than 183cm. 
* **Team 1's Complexity is Distracting:** While Team 1 introduces the concept of ranking and a "middle man", this complexity doesn't change the fundamental probability. Whether a man is the tallest, shortest, or in-between in a group of three doesn't influence his individual likelihood of being taller than 183cm.
* **Law of Large Numbers:**  Over 365 days, both teams are conducting a large number of trials. The law of large numbers suggests that the more trials you perform, the closer the experimental results will get to the true underlying probability.

**In essence, both teams are effectively sampling the same population with the goal of determining the proportion of men taller than 183cm.  While their methods differ slightly, the large sample size makes it highly likely they'll arrive at very similar results.**
