{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why it's likely that both teams counted a similar number of days:

* **Probability Focus:**  The problem boils down to the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183cm. 
* **Team 1's Scenario:** While Team 1 ranks the men, their focus on the middle person doesn't inherently change the probability of someone being taller than 183cm. They are just looking at a specific individual within their sample of three.
* **Team 2's Scenario:** Team 2 directly measures the probability we're interested in â€“ the chance of a single randomly selected man being taller than 183cm.
* **Law of Large Numbers:** Over 365 days, both teams are conducting a large number of trials.  The law of large numbers suggests that over many trials, the observed frequency of an event (a man being taller than 183cm) will converge towards its actual probability.

**Since both teams are ultimately measuring the same underlying probability (even if through slightly different methods), it's highly probable their results will be very similar over such a long period.**
