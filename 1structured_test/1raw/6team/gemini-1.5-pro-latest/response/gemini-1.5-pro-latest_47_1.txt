Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They count days where the middle person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on a *single* random person's height each day. They count days where that person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

The key here is that the average height is 178cm, and the height distribution is symmetrical (equal numbers above and below the average). This means:

* **Team 1:** For the middle person in a group of three to be taller than 183cm, at least two out of the three people surveyed that day need to be taller than 183cm. 
* **Team 2:** Has a higher chance of picking someone taller than 183cm on any given day because they only need one person to meet the criteria.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height exceeded 183cm.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
