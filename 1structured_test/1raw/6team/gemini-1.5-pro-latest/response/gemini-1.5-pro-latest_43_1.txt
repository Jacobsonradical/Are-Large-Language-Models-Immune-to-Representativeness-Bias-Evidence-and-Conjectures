{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams are likely to have counts within 5% of each other:

* **Team 2's process is straightforward:** They directly sample the population and count how many times a man taller than 183cm appears. This gives a direct estimate of the proportion of men taller than 183cm in the population.

* **Team 1's process, while seemingly more complex, boils down to a similar idea:**  
    * They are essentially looking for days when at least two out of the three men sampled are taller than 183cm (because if two are taller, the middle one must be too).
    * Over a large number of trials (365 days), the probability of getting at least two men taller than 183cm in a group of three will closely reflect the underlying proportion of men taller than 183cm in the population.

**Key Point:** Both methods are ultimately trying to estimate the same underlying proportion. While there will be random variation, over a large sample size like this, the results are likely to be very close.
