{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

While it might seem like Team 1 would have more days with a middle man over 183cm (since they have more chances each day), the probabilities even out over time. Here's why:

* **Team 1 (3 men):**  They need the *middle* man to be taller than 183cm. This means they need one man shorter, one in the middle, and one taller than 183cm. The specific heights of the shortest and tallest men don't matter as much.
* **Team 2 (1 man):** They have a simple condition: the one man needs to be taller than 183cm.

Since the population has an equal distribution of men above and below the average height, the chances of finding one man above 183cm (Team 2) is roughly the same as finding a group of three where the middle one is above 183cm (Team 1). 

Over 365 days, the law of large numbers comes into play. Both teams are conducting a large number of trials, and their results will likely converge to reflect the actual proportion of men taller than 183cm in the population.  A 5% difference is plausible due to random chance, but a significant difference is unlikely.
