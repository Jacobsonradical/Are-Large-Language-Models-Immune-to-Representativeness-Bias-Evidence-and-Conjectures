{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams will likely have counts within 5% of each other:

* **Team 2's approach is more straightforward.** They're directly measuring the percentage of men taller than 183cm.
* **Team 1's approach is indirect but related.**  They are looking at the middle person in a group of three.  Think about it: the middle person will be taller than 183cm only if at least two out of the three men sampled are taller than 183cm. This is still fundamentally tied to the percentage of men in the population taller than 183cm.

**Why not exactly the same?**

While both methods are driven by the underlying proportion of men taller than 183cm, there's a bit of randomness involved in daily sampling. Team 1, especially, might have some days where by chance they pick three men who are all unusually tall or unusually short. However, over 365 days, these random fluctuations should mostly average out.

**In essence:** Both teams are ultimately estimating the same thing (the proportion of men taller than 183cm), just through slightly different methods.  The law of large numbers suggests their results should be very close over a year of sampling.
