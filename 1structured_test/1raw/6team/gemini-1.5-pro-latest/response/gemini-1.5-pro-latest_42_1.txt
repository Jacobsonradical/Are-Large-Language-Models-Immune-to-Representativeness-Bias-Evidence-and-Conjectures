{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams would likely have very similar counts:

* **Team 1 (Middle Man):**  The key here is that Team 1 is focusing on the *middle* person in a group of three.  Since the height distribution is symmetrical around the average (178 cm), and 183 cm is a fair bit above average, it's less likely to find the *middle* person of a random group of three exceeding that height.

* **Team 2 (Single Man):** Team 2 has a simpler approach â€“ they just need one person out of the population to be taller than 183cm.

**Probability:** While we don't have the exact distribution of heights, we know it's symmetrical.  The chances of finding one man taller than 183cm (Team 2) versus finding the *middle* man of a group of three above 183cm (Team 1) are likely quite similar when looking at a large sample size (365 days).

**5% Difference:**  Over 365 days, a 5% difference is roughly 18 days. Given the nature of random sampling and the height distribution, it's entirely plausible the teams could be within that range.
