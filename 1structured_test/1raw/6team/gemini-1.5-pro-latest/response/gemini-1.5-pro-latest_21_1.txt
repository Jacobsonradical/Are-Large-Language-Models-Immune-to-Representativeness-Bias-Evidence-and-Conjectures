Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:** Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They'll record a day if that *middle* person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:** Focuses on whether a *single* person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178cm and heights are symmetrically distributed, there's a higher probability of finding a single person taller than 183cm than finding a group of three where the *middle* person is taller than 183cm. 

**Why?**

Team 1 needs at least two out of the three people to be taller than 183cm for their count to increase. Team 2 only needs their one selection to be taller.

**Answer**

{team: 2} 

Team 2 is highly likely to have counted more days where the surveyed individual was taller than 183cm.
