Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  This means the tallest and shortest are less relevant.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* person is above the height threshold.

**Logic**

* For Team 1 to count a day, the middle person needs to be taller than 183cm. This implies at least two out of the three people surveyed that day need to be taller than 183cm.
* Team 2 has a higher chance of counting a day because they only need one person to be taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days.

**Answer:**

```json
{
"team": 2
}
```
