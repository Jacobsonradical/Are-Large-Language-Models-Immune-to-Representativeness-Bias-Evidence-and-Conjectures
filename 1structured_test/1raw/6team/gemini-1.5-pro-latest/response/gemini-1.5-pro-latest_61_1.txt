{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams would likely have very similar counts:

* **Team 1 (Middle Man):** While Team 1 focuses on the middle person, the probability of the middle person being taller than 183cm is roughly the same as the probability of any single random person being taller than 183cm.  
* **Team 2 (Single Person):** Team 2 directly measures the probability of a random person being taller than 183cm.

Since both teams are essentially measuring the same underlying probability (the chance a random man from the population is taller than 183cm), their results over a large sample size (365 days) should be very close.  The 5% margin accounts for the natural variations expected in random sampling.
