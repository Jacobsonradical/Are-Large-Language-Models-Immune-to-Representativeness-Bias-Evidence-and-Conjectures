Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. This means for the middle person to be over 183cm, at least two out of the three people surveyed that day need to be taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Has a simpler task, just counting the days a *single* surveyed person is over 183cm.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178cm, and heights are symmetrically distributed, the probability of finding someone taller than 183cm is going to be less than 50%. 

Team 1 requires this less likely event (finding someone taller than 183cm) to happen *at least twice* in a group of three. Team 2 only needs it to happen once.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is much more likely to have counted more days where the height requirement was met.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
