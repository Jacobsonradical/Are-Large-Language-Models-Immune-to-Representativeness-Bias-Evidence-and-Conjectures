Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Setup**

* **Team 1:** Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They'll record a day only if the *middle* person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* person is taller than 183cm.

**Reasoning**

The key here is that the average height (178cm) and the height threshold (183cm) are quite far apart.  Since heights are normally distributed, finding someone taller than 183cm isn't very common.

* **Team 1:** For the middle person in a group of three to be taller than 183cm, it's likely that at least two, if not all three, people in the group need to be unusually tall. This is less likely.
* **Team 2:**  They have a higher chance of finding someone taller than 183cm compared to Team 1 because they only need one person to meet the criteria.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
