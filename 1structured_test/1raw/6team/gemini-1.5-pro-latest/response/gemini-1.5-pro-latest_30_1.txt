Here's how to figure out which team likely counted more days:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:** Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They'll count a day if the MIDDLE person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on if a *single* person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178cm and there's an equal distribution above and below, 183cm is significantly above average. 

Team 1, by focusing on the *middle* person, reduces the likelihood of counting a day. For them to count a day, at least two out of the three people surveyed would need to be taller than 183cm.

Team 2 has a higher chance of counting a day because they only need one person to be taller than 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2} 

**Explanation:** Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days because their criteria are easier to meet given the height distribution.
