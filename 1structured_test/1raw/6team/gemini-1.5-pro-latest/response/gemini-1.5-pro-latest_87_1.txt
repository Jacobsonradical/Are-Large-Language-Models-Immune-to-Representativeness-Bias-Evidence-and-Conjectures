{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

While it might seem like Team 1 would have a higher count because they're looking at three men each day, the key lies in the way they're measuring. Team 1 is only interested in the *middle* man's height exceeding 183cm.  

Here's why this matters:

* **Distribution:**  The prompt states the average height of men is 178cm with an even distribution above and below. This means there's a significant portion of men both taller and shorter than 183cm.
* **Middle Man Effect:** For the middle man in Team 1's sample to be taller than 183cm, *all three* men surveyed that day would likely need to be quite tall. 
* **Team 2's Direct Approach:** Team 2, on the other hand, directly measures the chance of *any* man being taller than 183cm.

**In the long run (365 days), both teams are essentially measuring the proportion of men taller than 183cm, just in different ways. The law of large numbers suggests their counts will be very close, likely within 5% of each other.**
