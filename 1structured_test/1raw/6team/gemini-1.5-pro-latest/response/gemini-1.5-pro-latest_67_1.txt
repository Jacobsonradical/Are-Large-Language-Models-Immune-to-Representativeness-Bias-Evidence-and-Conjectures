Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They have more chances to find someone above 183cm, but only if that person is the middle height.
* **Team 2:**  Has a simpler approach, directly checking if a single person is above 183cm.

**Logic**

The key is that the average height is 178cm, and the distribution is symmetrical. This means:

* There's a slightly higher probability of finding someone taller than 183cm than someone shorter than 173cm (since 183cm is further from the average than 173cm).
* Team 1's 'middle person' strategy makes it *less* likely they'll count days where the tallest person is over 183cm, as the other two people would need to be shorter.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 has a higher chance of counting more days. This is because they directly look for anyone above 183cm, while Team 1's method indirectly reduces their chances.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
