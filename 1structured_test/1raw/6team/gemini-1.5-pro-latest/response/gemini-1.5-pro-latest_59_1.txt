Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They are counting days where that middle person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* person is taller than 183cm.

**Reasoning**

Since the average height of men in the population is 178cm, and the distribution is symmetrical around the average, there's a significant chance that in a group of three men:

* At least one man will be taller than 178cm.
* At least one man will be shorter than 178cm. 

This makes it more likely that the middle person in Team 1's group will be close to the average height.  It's less likely that the middle person will consistently be taller than 183cm.

Team 2, on the other hand, has a direct chance of selecting someone taller than 183cm each day.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the surveyed individual is taller than 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
