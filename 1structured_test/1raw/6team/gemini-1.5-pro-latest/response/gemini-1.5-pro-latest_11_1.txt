Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Setup**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. This means the tallest and shortest person in each group are irrelevant.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* person is taller than 183cm. 

**Logic**

The key is recognizing that Team 1's method biases towards taller individuals.  Consider these points:

* For the middle person in Team 1's group to be over 183cm, at least two out of the three people sampled that day need to be taller than 183cm. 
* Team 2 only needs one person to be taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

Since it's more likely to find one person taller than 183cm than it is to find two people taller than 183cm in a random group of three, Team 2 will likely record more such days.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
