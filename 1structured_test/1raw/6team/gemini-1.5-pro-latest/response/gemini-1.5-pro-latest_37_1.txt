Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They'll count a day if the *middle* person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* random person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

The key is that the average height is 178cm, and the height distribution is symmetrical (equal numbers above and below average). This means:

* Finding someone taller than 183cm is relatively uncommon. 
* For Team 1 to count a day, the middle person out of three has to be quite tall. This is less likely than Team 2 simply finding one person out of one who is that tall.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height exceeded 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
