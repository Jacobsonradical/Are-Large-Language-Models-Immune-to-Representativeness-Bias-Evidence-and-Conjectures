{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams are likely to have counts within 5% of each other:

* **Probability Focus:** The problem boils down to the probability of a man being taller than 183cm in this population.  
* **Team 1 (Three Men):** While Team 1 ranks the men, the crucial factor is whether the *middle* man is taller than 183cm. This doesn't directly translate to all three men needing to be taller. 
* **Team 2 (One Man):** Team 2's count is a straightforward representation of the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183cm.

**Since both teams are ultimately influenced by the same underlying probability (chance of a man being taller than 183cm), over a large sample size (365 days), their counts should be very similar, likely within 5% of each other.**
