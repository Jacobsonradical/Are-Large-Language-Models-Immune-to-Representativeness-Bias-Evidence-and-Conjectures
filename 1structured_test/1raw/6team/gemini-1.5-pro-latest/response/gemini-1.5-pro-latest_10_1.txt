Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They'll count a day if that middle person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178cm and there's an equal distribution above and below, there's a significant portion of the male population below 183cm. 

* **Team 1:** For the middle person in a group of three to be taller than 183cm, at least two out of the three men surveyed that day need to be taller than 183cm. This is less likely.
* **Team 2:** They have a higher chance of counting days because they only need one person to be taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height exceeds 183cm.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
