{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the answer is likely 3 (the teams will have roughly the same count):

* **Probability Focus:**  The core of this problem is about the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183cm. It doesn't matter if you select one man (Team 2) or three and then focus on the middle man (Team 1). 
* **Consistent Population:** Both teams are drawing from the same population every day. The height distribution within that population remains constant.
* **Large Sample Size:** Over 365 days, both teams are gathering a large enough sample size that the day-to-day variations in random selection should even out.

**Analogy:**

Imagine flipping a coin. Whether you flip one coin (Team 2) or three coins and focus on the middle coin's result (Team 1), the chances of getting heads are roughly the same over many flips.
