Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  For the middle person to be over 183cm, at least two out of the three people surveyed that day must be taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Has a simpler task â€“ just checking if a single person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178cm and there's an equal distribution above and below the average, the odds of finding someone taller than 183cm are likely less than 50%.  (183cm is significantly taller than the average).

Team 1 requires this less-likely event (finding someone taller than 183cm) to happen *at least twice* in a group of three. Team 2 only needs it to happen once.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height exceeded 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
