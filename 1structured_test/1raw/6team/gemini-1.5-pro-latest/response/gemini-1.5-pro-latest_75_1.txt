Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  This means for the middle person to be over 183cm, at least two out of the three people surveyed that day need to be taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* person's height is over 183cm.

**Logic**

It's more likely that Team 2 will count more days with a person over 183cm. Here's why:

* Team 1 requires a more specific condition to be met (two out of three people being over 183cm).
* Team 2 only needs one person to meet the condition.

**Therefore, the answer is {team: 2}**
