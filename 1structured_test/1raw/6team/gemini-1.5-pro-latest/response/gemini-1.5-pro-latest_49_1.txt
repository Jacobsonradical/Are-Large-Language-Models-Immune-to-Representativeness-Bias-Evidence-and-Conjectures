Let's analyze the situation:

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person in a group of three. For this middle person to be taller than 183cm, you need at least two out of the three people surveyed to be taller than 183cm. 
* **Team 2:**  Has a simpler condition â€“ they just need the single person they pick to be taller than 183cm.

Since being taller than 183cm is likely less common than being shorter (given the average height and symmetrical distribution around the average), Team 2 has a higher chance of success each day.  It's more probable to find one person taller than 183cm than to find at least two out of three.

**Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days.**

{team: 2}
