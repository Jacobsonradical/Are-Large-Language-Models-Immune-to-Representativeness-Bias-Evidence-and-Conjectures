Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:** Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They'll count a day if the middle person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178cm and the distribution is symmetrical, there's an equal chance of someone being taller or shorter than average.  

* **Team 1:**  For the middle person in a group of three to be taller than 183cm, you generally need at least two out of the three people to be taller than 183cm.  
* **Team 2:** Has a simpler condition â€“ just one person needs to be taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to count more days because their requirement is easier to meet. Team 1's count depends on a less probable event (two out of three people being taller than 183cm).

**Answer**

{team: 2}
