Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. For the middle height to be above 183cm, at least two out of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on individual heights, simply counting those above 183cm.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178cm and the distribution is symmetric, finding someone taller than 183cm is less likely than finding someone shorter than 183cm. 

Team 1 requires this less likely scenario (finding someone taller than 183cm) to happen *twice* in a group of three for their count to increase. Team 2 only needs it to happen once.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
