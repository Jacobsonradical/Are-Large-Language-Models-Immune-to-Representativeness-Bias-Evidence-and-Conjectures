Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They'll record a 'success' if that middle person is taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on a *single* person's height. They'll record a 'success' if that person is taller than 183 cm.

**Intuitive Reasoning**

For Team 1 to have a success, they need a more specific scenario: at least two out of the three people surveyed must be taller than 183 cm. Team 2 only needs one person to meet the height requirement. Since finding one person taller than 183 cm is more likely than finding at least two, Team 2 is likely to have more 'successes'.

**Conclusion**

While we don't have the exact probabilities, it's highly probable that Team 2 counted more days.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
