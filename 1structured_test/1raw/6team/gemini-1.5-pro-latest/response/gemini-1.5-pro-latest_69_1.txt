Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They count days where the middle person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on a *single* person's height. They count days where that person is taller than 183cm.

**The Key Insight**

The crucial difference is that Team 1 is looking for the middle height to be above 183cm. For this to happen, *at least two* out of the three men surveyed on that day must be taller than 183cm. 

**Reasoning**

Since the average height is 178cm and the distribution is symmetrical, finding someone taller than 183cm is less likely than finding someone shorter than 183cm.  

Team 1 requires this less likely event (being taller than 183cm) to happen twice in a group of three. This makes it much less likely for Team 1 to record a "successful" day compared to Team 2.

**Answer**

Team 2 is far more likely to have counted more days.

{team: 2}
