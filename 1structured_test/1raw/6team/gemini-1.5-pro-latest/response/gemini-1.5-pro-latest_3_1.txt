{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams are likely to have counts within 5% of each other:

* **Random Sampling:** Both teams are using random sampling from the same population. This means, over a large number of trials (365 days in this case), the distribution of heights they encounter should be similar.
* **Focus on Proportion:**  The crucial factor is the *proportion* of men in the population taller than 183cm.  
    * Team 1's method of ranking within a group of three doesn't inherently mean they'll encounter more men above 183cm.
    * Team 2 is directly measuring the frequency of encountering men above 183cm. 

**Law of Large Numbers:** With a large enough sample size, the law of large numbers suggests that the results of both teams should converge towards the true proportion of men taller than 183cm in the population. 

**5% Difference:** While there might be slight variations, it's unlikely to be a significant difference (more than 5%) due to the random sampling and the large number of trials.
