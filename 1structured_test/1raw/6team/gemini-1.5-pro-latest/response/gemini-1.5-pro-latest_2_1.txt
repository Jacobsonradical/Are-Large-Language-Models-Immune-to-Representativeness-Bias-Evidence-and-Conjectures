Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They'll have days where the middle person is tall, but also days where the middle person is shorter because the other two are very tall or very short.
* **Team 2:**  Has a simpler approach â€“ just looking for anyone taller than 183cm.

**Reasoning**

The key here is that Team 1's data is influenced by the extremes of height.  Let's imagine these scenarios:

* **Scenario 1: Two very tall people.** If Team 1 picks two men who are well over 183cm, the middle person *could* be shorter than 183cm, even though the average height is being skewed upwards.
* **Scenario 2: One very short person.**  If Team 1 picks one person who is very short, the middle person might be just above average (and below 183cm), even though they are being pulled down by the outlier.

Team 2 avoids this problem entirely. They are simply looking for anyone above the threshold.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to count more days with a person taller than 183cm. 

**Answer**

{team: 2}
