{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams are likely to have a similar count (within 5%) of days with a man taller than 183cm:

* **Random Sampling:** Both teams are using random sampling from the same population. This means that over a large number of trials (365 days in this case), the variations in individual daily results should average out.
* **Focus on Proportion:** The core question is about the proportion of men in the population taller than 183cm. Team 1's ranking system doesn't change this underlying proportion.
* **Large Sample Size:** 365 days is a significant sample size. The Law of Large Numbers suggests that as the sample size increases, the results obtained should converge towards the true population proportion. 

**While there might be slight day-to-day variations, over 365 days, both teams are essentially trying to estimate the same thing: the percentage of men in the population taller than 183cm. Therefore, their results are likely to be very close.**
