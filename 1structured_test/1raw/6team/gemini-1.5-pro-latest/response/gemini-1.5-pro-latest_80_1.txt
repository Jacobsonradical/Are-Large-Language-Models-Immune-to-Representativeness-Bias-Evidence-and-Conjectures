Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They only count a day if that *middle* person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* randomly selected person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

The key here is that the average height is 178cm, and the threshold is 183cm. This means we're looking at heights significantly above average.

* **Team 1 (Middle Person):**  For the middle person in a group of three to be taller than 183cm, it's likely that at least two, if not all three, of the men surveyed that day are taller than average. 
* **Team 2 (Single Person):** They have a more straightforward chance of selecting someone taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height exceeds 183cm.  Team 1's requirement that the *middle* person be that tall makes it a less frequent occurrence. 

**Answer**

{team: 2}
