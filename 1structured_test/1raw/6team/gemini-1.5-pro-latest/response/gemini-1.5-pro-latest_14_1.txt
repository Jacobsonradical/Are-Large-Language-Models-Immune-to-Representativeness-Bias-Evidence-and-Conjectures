Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. This means the middle person needs to be taller than 183 cm, and at least one person in the group must be shorter.
* **Team 2:**  Only cares if the *single* person surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

**Logic**

Team 2 has a higher chance of counting more days. Here's why:

* **Team 1's Restriction:**  Team 1's requirement of the middle person being taller than 183cm introduces a constraint. They need a specific height distribution within their group of three.
* **Team 2's Freedom:** Team 2 has no such constraint.  They have a chance to count a day every time they pick someone taller than 183cm, regardless of the overall height distribution in the population.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
