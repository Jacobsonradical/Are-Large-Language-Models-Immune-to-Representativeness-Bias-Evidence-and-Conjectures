Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  Their count increases only if the MIDDLE person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:** Focuses on whether a *single* random person is taller than 183cm.

**Reasoning**

Since the average height is 178cm and there's an equal distribution above and below, there's a significant portion of the male population shorter than 183cm.  

* **Team 1:** For their count to increase, they need:
    * One person taller than 183cm.
    * One person shorter than 183cm.
    * One person in the middle (their height relative to 183cm doesn't matter as much).

* **Team 2:** Their count increases any time they pick someone taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 has a higher probability of counting more days. This is because their criteria are less restrictive than Team 1's.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
