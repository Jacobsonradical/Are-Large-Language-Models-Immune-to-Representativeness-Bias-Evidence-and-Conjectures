Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They record days where that middle height exceeds 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on individual heights, recording days where the single person's height exceeds 183cm.

**Reasoning**

The key here is that Team 1 is more likely to have a middle person taller than 183cm. Here's why:

* **Distribution:** Since heights have a somewhat even distribution around the average, there's a good chance that in a group of three men, at least one will be taller than average and one will be shorter. This makes it more probable that the middle person's height falls in a range above the average.
* **Team 2's Focus:** Team 2 needs their single selection to be above 183cm, which is less likely than Team 1's scenario.

**Conclusion**

Team 1 is more likely to have recorded more days where the height of interest (middle person for Team 1, single person for Team 2) was above 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 1}
