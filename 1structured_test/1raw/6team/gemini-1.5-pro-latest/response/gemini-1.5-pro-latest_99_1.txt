Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. For the middle height to be above 183cm, at least two out of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* randomly selected man is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

The probability of finding one man taller than 183cm is lower than the probability of finding at least two men taller than 183cm within a group of three.  This is because Team 1 has more chances each day to find someone taller than 183cm.

**Answer**

Since Team 1 has a higher probability of recording days with a height above 183cm, they likely counted more such days.

{team: 1}
