Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. Their count increases only if the MIDDLE person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:** Focuses on individual heights. Their count increases every time a person taller than 183cm is surveyed.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178cm, and there's an equal distribution above and below this average, finding someone taller than 183cm is relatively uncommon. 

Team 1 relies on finding one person *above* 183cm, and one person *below* 183cm in the same group of three for their count to increase.  This is less likely than Team 2 simply finding one person taller than 183cm.

**Answer**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days. 

{team: 2}
