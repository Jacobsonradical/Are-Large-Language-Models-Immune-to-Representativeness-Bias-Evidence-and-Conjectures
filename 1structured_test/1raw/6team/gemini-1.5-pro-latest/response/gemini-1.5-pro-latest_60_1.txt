{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams would likely have very similar counts:

* **Team 1 (3 men, looking for the middle):**  The key here is focusing on the *middle* person. For the middle person to be over 183cm, you'd need at least two out of the three men to be taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2 (1 man):** This is a simpler scenario. They are simply recording how many times they find a man taller than 183cm.

**Probability and the Law of Large Numbers**

Both teams are essentially measuring the same underlying probability: the likelihood of a randomly selected man from the population being taller than 183cm.  

Over a large enough sample size (365 days is a large sample), the law of large numbers comes into play. This means that the results of both teams will converge towards the actual percentage of men in the population who are taller than 183cm.

**Minor Differences**

While we expect the results to be very close, there might be tiny variations due to the random nature of the sampling. However, it's highly unlikely that the difference would be more than 5%.
