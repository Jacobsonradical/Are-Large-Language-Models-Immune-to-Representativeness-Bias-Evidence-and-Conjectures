Let's analyze the situation:

* **Team 1** has a higher chance of finding someone taller than 183cm on any given day because they are sampling three people instead of one.  However, their count only increases if the *middle* person is taller than 183cm. This means one or even two people in their sample could be taller than 183cm, but it wouldn't be counted unless the middle person was also.

* **Team 2** directly counts the number of times their single selection is taller than 183cm.

Since 183cm is significantly taller than the average height, finding someone above that mark is relatively less likely.  Team 1's method introduces a significant constraint by requiring the middle person of their three selections to be that tall.

**Therefore, it's more likely Team 2 counted more such days.**
