Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They'll count a day if the MIDDLE person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:** Focuses on if a *single* person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178cm and heights are symmetrically distributed, there's a good chance of finding someone taller than 183cm in any random sample.  

Team 1, however, requires the *middle* person to be taller than 183cm. This means they need at least two out of the three people sampled to be taller than 183cm. This is a less likely event than Team 2's requirement of just one person being taller.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height exceeded 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
