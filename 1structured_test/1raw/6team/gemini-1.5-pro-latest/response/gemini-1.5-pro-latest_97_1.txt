Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. This means the shortest and tallest people in each group are irrelevant.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* person's height is above 183 cm.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178 cm and heights are symmetrically distributed, there's a greater chance that at least one person in a group of three will be taller than 183 cm, compared to just a single person being taller than 183 cm. 

**Why?**  Team 1 has more chances to find someone taller than 183 cm in their daily sample.

**Answer**

{team: 1}
