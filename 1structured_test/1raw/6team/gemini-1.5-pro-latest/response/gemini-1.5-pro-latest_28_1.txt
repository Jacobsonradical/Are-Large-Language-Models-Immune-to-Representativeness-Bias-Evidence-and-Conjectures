Here's how to determine the answer:

* **Understanding the Problem:** The core of the problem lies in understanding the probability of a man being taller than 183cm.  We don't know the exact distribution of heights, but we know 178cm is the average and there's symmetry around the average.
* **Team 2's Approach:**  Team 2 directly measures the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183cm.
* **Team 1's Approach:** Team 1 introduces a condition: the middle height of three men.  For the middle man to be taller than 183cm, at least two out of the three men surveyed on that day must be taller than 183cm.

**Reasoning:**

Since being taller than 183cm is already less likely than being shorter (as 183cm is above the average), requiring *two* men to be taller than 183cm in a group of three makes it even less likely compared to finding a single man taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion:**

Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height is greater than 183cm.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
