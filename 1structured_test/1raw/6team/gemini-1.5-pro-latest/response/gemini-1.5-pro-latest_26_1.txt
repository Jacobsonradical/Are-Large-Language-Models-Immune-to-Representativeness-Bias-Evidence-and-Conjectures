{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams would likely end up with similar counts:

* **Probability Focus:** The core issue is the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183cm.  Both teams are ultimately gathering data to assess this probability.
* **Team 1's Complexity:** While Team 1 introduces the ranking element, it doesn't fundamentally change the underlying probability. The middle man in their sample might be taller some days, shorter on others, but this will average out over a large number of trials.
* **Law of Large Numbers:** With 365 days, both teams have a significant sample size.  The law of large numbers suggests that as the number of trials increases, the observed results will converge towards the true probability.

**In conclusion:** While there might be slight day-to-day variations, over 365 days, both teams are essentially measuring the same underlying probability.  A 5% difference is a reasonable margin of error given the random sampling.
