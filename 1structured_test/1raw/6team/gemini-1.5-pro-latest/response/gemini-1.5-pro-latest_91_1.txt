Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They only count days where the *middle* person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on a *single* random person's height each day. They count days where that individual is taller than 183cm.

**Reasoning**

The key is recognizing that Team 1's method biases towards taller individuals.  Here's why:

* For the middle person in a group of three to be taller than 183cm, you need at least two out of the three people to be taller than 183cm. 
* This means Team 1 is essentially looking for days where the majority of their sample is tall.

Team 2, on the other hand, has a simpler criterion.  They just need one person to be taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height exceeds 183cm. This is because they have a higher probability of finding at least one tall person within their daily sample.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
