{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

While it might seem like Team 1 would have a higher count because they survey three men daily, the crucial factor is the selection criterion. Team 1 is specifically interested in the *middle* man's height.  

* **Distribution of Height:** The average height is 178cm with symmetrical distribution. This means the probability of finding someone taller than 183cm is relatively low, and the probability of the *middle* person in a random group of three being taller than 183cm is even lower. 

* **Law of Large Numbers:** Over 365 days, both teams are essentially drawing from the same population distribution.  Team 2's direct approach of counting men taller than 183cm and Team 1's indirect approach (middle man taller than 183cm) will, with a large sample size, converge to a proportion representative of the actual percentage of men taller than 183cm in the population.

**Therefore, over 365 days, the counts from both teams will likely be within 5% of each other.**
