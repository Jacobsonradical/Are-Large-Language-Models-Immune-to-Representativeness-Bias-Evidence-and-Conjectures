Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:** Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. This means the tallest and shortest person each day are irrelevant.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178cm and the distribution is symmetrical, there's a greater chance that at least *one* person out of three will be taller than 183cm (Team 1) compared to the chance of a *single* person being taller than 183cm (Team 2).

**Conclusion**

Team 1 is more likely to have counted more days where the height exceeded 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 1}
