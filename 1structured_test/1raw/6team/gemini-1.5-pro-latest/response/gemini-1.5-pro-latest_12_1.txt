{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

While it might seem like Team 1 would have more days with a middle man over 183cm because they survey more people daily, the probabilities actually even out. Here's why:

* **Team 1 (3 men):** For the middle man to be over 183cm, they need to find at least two men in the survey who are taller than that. This is dependent on finding multiple individuals from the tail end of the height distribution.
* **Team 2 (1 man):** They simply need that one man to be taller than 183cm. 

Since the men are randomly selected each day, and the average height is 178cm with an even distribution above and below, both teams are essentially looking at the same probability: the chance of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183cm.  

Over a long period like 365 days, the law of large numbers suggests these probabilities will even out.  Both teams' counts should be very close, likely within 5% of each other.
