Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:** Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  Their count increases only if the *middle* person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* person is taller than 183cm.

**Reasoning**

Since the average height is 178cm and the distribution is symmetrical, there's a significant portion of the male population below 183cm. 

* **Team 1:**  For the middle person to be taller than 183cm, at least two out of the three men surveyed on that day need to be taller than 183cm. This is less likely.
* **Team 2:** Has a higher chance of finding someone taller than 183cm on any given day because they only need one person to meet the criteria.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a man taller than 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
