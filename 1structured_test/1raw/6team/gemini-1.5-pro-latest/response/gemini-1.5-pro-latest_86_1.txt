{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams are likely to have counts within 5% of each other:

* **Probability is Key:** Both teams are essentially measuring the probability of a man from the population being taller than 183cm. Team 1 does this in a more roundabout way, but the underlying principle is the same.
* **Large Sample Size:** Over 365 days, both teams have a large enough sample size. Team 1 surveys 1095 men (3 men/day * 365 days) and Team 2 surveys 365 men.  The law of large numbers suggests that with large sample sizes, observed frequencies tend to align with underlying probabilities. 

**While Team 1 might seem like it has a higher chance because they are looking for the middle person to be tall, the selection of *any* three random men each day makes this method just another way of sampling the overall height distribution in the population.**
