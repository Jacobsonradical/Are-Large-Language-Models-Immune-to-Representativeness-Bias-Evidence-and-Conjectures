{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

While it might seem like Team 1 would have more days with a middle man over 183cm (since they have more chances each day), the probabilities even out over time. Here's why:

* **Team 1 (3 men):**  They need the *middle* man to be taller than 183cm. This means they need one man taller, one man shorter, and one in the middle. 
* **Team 2 (1 man):** They simply need that one man to be taller than 183cm.

Since the population has an equal distribution of men above and below the average height, the chances of finding one man above 183cm (Team 2) are roughly the same as the chances of finding a middle man above 183cm within a group of three (Team 1).

**In the long run (365 days), both teams are likely to end up with very similar counts.**  Small variations might occur due to the randomness of the surveys, but the difference wouldn't be significant enough to be outside a 5% margin.
