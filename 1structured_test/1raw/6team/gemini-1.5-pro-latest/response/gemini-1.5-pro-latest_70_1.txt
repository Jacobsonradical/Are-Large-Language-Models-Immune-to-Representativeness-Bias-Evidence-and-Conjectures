Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. This means for the middle height to be above 183cm, at least two out of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Has a simpler task; they only need one man to be taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

Since Team 1 requires a higher minimum number of men (two out of three) to be taller than 183cm, they are less likely to record a day where the condition is met compared to Team 2.

**Answer**

{team: 2} 

**Explanation:** Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the man's height was taller than 183cm because they only require one man to meet the condition.
