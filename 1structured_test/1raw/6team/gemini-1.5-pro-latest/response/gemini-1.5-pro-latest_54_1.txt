Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  Their count increases only if the MIDDLE person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:** Focuses on *individual* heights. Their count increases every time they find a person taller than 183cm.

**Reasoning**

Since the average height is 178cm, and there's an equal distribution above and below, finding someone taller than 183cm is already less likely than finding someone shorter. 

Team 1 adds an extra layer of complexity: for their count to increase, they need:

1.  At least one person taller than 183cm.
2.  One person shorter than 183cm (to be the shortest).
3.  The remaining person to also be taller than 183cm (to be the middle).

This combination is significantly less likely than Team 2 simply finding a single person taller than 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2} 

**Explanation:** Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a person taller than 183cm because they are looking for a single individual meeting the criteria, while Team 1 needs a specific combination within their group of three.
