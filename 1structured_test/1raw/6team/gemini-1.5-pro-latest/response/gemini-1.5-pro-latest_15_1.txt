{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Focus on the Key Variable:** The question centers on the likelihood of a man being taller than 183cm. The ranking done by Team 1 is a distraction. 
* **Equal Probability:**  Both teams are sampling from the same population. On any given day, the chance of Team 1 finding a man taller than 183cm is the *same* as Team 2 finding a man taller than 183cm.
* **Law of Large Numbers:** Over 365 days, the daily fluctuations in height will even out.  Both teams are effectively getting a large sample size of the population.

**Therefore, while there might be slight variations, it's highly probable that the number of days each team records a man taller than 183cm will be very close (within 5%).**
