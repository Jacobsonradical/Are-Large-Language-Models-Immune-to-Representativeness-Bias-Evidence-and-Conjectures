Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1** is looking for the probability that in a group of 3 randomly selected men, the middle person's height is over 183cm.
* **Team 2** is looking for the probability that a single randomly selected man is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

We don't know the exact height distribution, only that it's symmetrical around 178cm.  However:

* For Team 1 to count a day, the middle person needs to be unusually tall (above 183cm).  This means either 2 or all 3 men surveyed that day need to be unusually tall.
* Team 2 counts a day if their single selected man is taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

It's more likely that a single random person is taller than 183cm, than it is to find that in a group of 3, the middle person is taller than 183cm. 

**Answer**

{team: 2}
