Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They record days where the middle person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on individual heights, recording days where the single person surveyed is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

The key here is that the average height is 178cm, and the distribution is symmetrical (equal numbers above and below the average). This means:

* **Finding someone taller than 183cm is less likely than finding someone shorter than 183cm.** 
* **Team 1, by focusing on the middle person, has a higher chance of finding someone closer to the average height.**

**Why Team 2 is More Likely**

Consider these scenarios:

* **Team 1:** If they pick three people, and one is very tall (above 183cm), the other two are more likely to be shorter to balance out the average.  The middle person might not always be the tallest.
* **Team 2:**  They have a direct chance of finding someone taller than 183cm on any given day.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed individual's height was taller than 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
