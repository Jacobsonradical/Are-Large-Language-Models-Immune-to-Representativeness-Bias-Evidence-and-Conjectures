Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. For the middle person to be over 183cm, at least two out of the three people surveyed must be taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* randomly selected person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178cm and heights are symmetrically distributed, the probability of finding one person taller than 183cm is roughly the same as finding one person shorter than 173cm (5cm below average). 

Team 1 requires a more specific condition to be met: finding at least *two* people taller than 183cm in a group of three. This is less likely than finding a single person taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height exceeded 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
