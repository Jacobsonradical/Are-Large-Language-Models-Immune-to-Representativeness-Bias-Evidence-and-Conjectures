Here's how to approach this problem:

* **Understanding the Setup:**  Both teams are looking for men taller than 183cm. Team 1 uses a more complex selection method (middle of three), while Team 2 directly samples for the desired trait.
* **The Key Insight:**  Since the height distribution is symmetrical around the average (178cm), the probability of finding a man taller than 183cm is the same as finding a man shorter than 173cm.  This symmetry is crucial.
* **Team 1's Odds:** For the middle man in Team 1's group to be taller than 183cm, you'd need at least two out of the three men to be taller than 183cm. This is less likely than finding just one man taller than 183cm (Team 2's method).

**Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days.**

**{team: 2}**
