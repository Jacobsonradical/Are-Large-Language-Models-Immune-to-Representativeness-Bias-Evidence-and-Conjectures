{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams would likely count a similar number of days:

* **Team 1 (Three Men):** While they are selecting three men, they are only focusing on the *middle* person's height.  Since the men are chosen randomly from a population where height is distributed evenly above and below the average, the odds of the middle person being taller than 183 cm is roughly the same as the odds of any single person being taller than 183 cm.

* **Team 2 (One Man):**  This team is directly measuring the chance of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm.

**In essence, both teams are looking at the same probability but in slightly different ways.** While there will be daily fluctuations, over a large sample size like 365 days, the results should be very close (within 5% of each other).
