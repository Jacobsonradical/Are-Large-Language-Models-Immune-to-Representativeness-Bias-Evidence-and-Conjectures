{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

While it might seem like Team 1 would have a higher count because they survey three men each day, the key lies in the selection criteria and probability:

* **Team 1:**  They need the *middle* man's height to be above 183cm. This means the tallest person in the group *must* be taller than 183cm, and so must the middle person. This is a more specific condition.
* **Team 2:** They only need their single selected man to be taller than 183cm.

Since the average height is 178cm and the distribution is symmetrical, the probability of finding one man taller than 183cm is roughly the same as finding a group of three where the *middle* person is taller than 183cm. 

**Therefore, both teams would likely end up with counts within 5% of each other over a long period.**
