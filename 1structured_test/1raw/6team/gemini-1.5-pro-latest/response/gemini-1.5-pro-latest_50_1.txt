Here's how to determine the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:** Focuses on the middle person's height in a group of three. Their count is only high if the middle person is unusually tall.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a single person is above a certain height. 

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178cm and there's an even distribution around the average, finding someone taller than 183cm is less likely than finding someone simply taller than the average. 

Team 1's success relies on finding a group of three where the *middle* person is already unusually tall. This is less likely than Team 2 finding just *one* person taller than 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
