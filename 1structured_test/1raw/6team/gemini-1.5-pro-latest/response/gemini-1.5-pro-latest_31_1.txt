Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They only count days where the *middle* person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:** Focuses on whether a *single* random person is taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

Since the average height of men is 178cm and the distribution is symmetrical (equal above and below), finding someone taller than 183cm is less common than finding someone shorter.

Team 1 benefits from this. For their count to increase, they only need *one* person out of the three to be taller than 183cm (because that would make the middle person also taller). Team 2 needs their single person to be taller.

**Conclusion**

Team 1 is more likely to have counted more days. 

**Answer:**

{team: 1}
