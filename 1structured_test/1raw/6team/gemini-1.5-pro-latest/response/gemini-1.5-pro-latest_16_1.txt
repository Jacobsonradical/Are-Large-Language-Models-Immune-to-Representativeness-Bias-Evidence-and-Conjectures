Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They're more likely to find someone above 183cm if the overall group has taller people.
* **Team 2:**  Has a simpler approach, just looking for anyone above 183cm.

**Why Team 2 is Likely to Count More**

Let's consider an extreme case to illustrate the point:

Imagine almost everyone in the population is slightly shorter than 183cm.  

* Team 1 would almost never find a middle person above 183cm because it's rare to have even one person that tall in a group of three.
* Team 2 still has a chance each day to find that single person who is taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

While it's theoretically possible for the teams to get similar results, it's much more likely that Team 2 will count more days with a person taller than 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
