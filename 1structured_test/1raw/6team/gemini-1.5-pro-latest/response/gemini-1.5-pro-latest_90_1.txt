Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They have more chances to find someone taller than 183cm in a day, but only if the middle person meets the criteria.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on *any* person's height. They have a direct chance of finding someone taller than 183cm each day.

**Intuitive Reasoning**

Think about the distribution of height. While there are men taller than 183cm, it's unlikely that in a random group of three, the *middle* person would consistently be taller than that. Team 2, by simply looking for anyone taller, has a higher probability on any given day.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed individual was taller than 183cm.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
