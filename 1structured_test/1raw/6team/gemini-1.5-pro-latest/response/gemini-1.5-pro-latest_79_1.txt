Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They count days where that middle height exceeds 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on individual heights, counting days where the single person's height exceeds 183cm.

**Logic**

The key is recognizing that Team 1's method biases towards taller heights.  For the middle person in a group of three to be taller than 183cm, at least two out of the three people surveyed on that day need to be taller than 183cm. 

Team 2, on the other hand, only needs one person to be taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height exceeds 183cm. This is because they are looking for a single instance of a taller person, while Team 1 needs at least two taller people in each group of three.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
