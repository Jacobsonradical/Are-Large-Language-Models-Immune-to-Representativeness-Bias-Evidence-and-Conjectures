Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They'll record a day if that middle person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:** Focuses on whether a *single* person is taller than 183cm.

**Reasoning**

* Since the average height is 178cm and there's an equal distribution above and below,  a man chosen at random is equally likely to be taller or shorter than 178cm. 
* For Team 1 to have a "successful" day (middle man taller than 183cm), at least two out of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183cm. 
* This is less likely than Team 2 having a "successful" day, as they only need one man to be taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height was above 183cm.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
