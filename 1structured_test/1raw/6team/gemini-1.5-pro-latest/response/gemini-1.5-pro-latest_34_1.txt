Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1** is looking for the probability that in a group of 3 random men, the middle man's height is over 183cm.
* **Team 2** is looking for the probability that a single randomly selected man has a height over 183cm.

**Logic**

The key here is that the average height doesn't actually matter.  What matters is that we're dealing with probabilities within a distribution. 

* **Team 2's** count directly reflects the percentage of men taller than 183cm.
* **Team 1's** count is more complex. For the middle man to be over 183cm, you need at least two out of the three men to be above that height. This is a smaller probability than finding just one man over 183cm (Team 2's task).

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days because their criteria are simpler and have a higher probability of occurring with each selection.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
