Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. This means they only count days where the middle person is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:** Focuses on whether a *single* person is taller than 183cm.

**Reasoning**

Since the average height is 178cm and the distribution is symmetrical (equal above and below), there's a less than 50% chance that a randomly selected man will be taller than 183cm. 

Team 1 requires the *middle* person out of three to be taller than 183cm. This is less likely than any single person being taller than 183cm (as Team 2 is looking for).

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height exceeded 183cm.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
