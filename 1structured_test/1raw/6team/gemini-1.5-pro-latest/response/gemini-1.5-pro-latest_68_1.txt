{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams will likely have counted a similar number of days:

* **Probability Focus:** The core issue is the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183cm.  
* **Team 1's Selection Bias:** While Team 1 ranks the men, this ranking doesn't change the underlying probability of any individual man being taller than 183cm. The middle man in their selection might be taller, shorter, or the same height as the man Team 2 selects on any given day.
* **Large Sample Size:** Over 365 days, both teams have a large enough sample size. Team 1 surveys 1095 men (3 men/day * 365 days), and Team 2 surveys 365 men.  The law of large numbers suggests that with such large samples, their results should converge towards the actual percentage of men in the population taller than 183cm.

**Slight Variation:** While the counts will be very close, they might not be exactly the same. There's always a chance for slight variations in random sampling. However, the difference is unlikely to be more than 5%, especially with such large sample sizes.
