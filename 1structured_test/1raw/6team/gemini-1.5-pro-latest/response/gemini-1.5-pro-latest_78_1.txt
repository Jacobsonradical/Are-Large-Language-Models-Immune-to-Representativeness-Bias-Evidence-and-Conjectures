{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams will likely have counted a similar number of days:

* **Focus on Probability:**  The core issue is the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183cm. Both teams are ultimately measuring this.
* **Team 1's Complexity:** Team 1's ranking system might seem relevant, but it's not. Whether the man taller than 183cm is the tallest, middle, or shortest in the group of three doesn't change the underlying probability of selecting a man taller than 183cm in the first place.
* **Law of Large Numbers:** Over 365 days, both teams are conducting a large number of trials. The law of large numbers suggests that as the number of trials increases, the results will converge towards the true probability.

**While there might be slight variations due to random chance, it's highly likely the two teams will end up with counts within 5% of each other.**
