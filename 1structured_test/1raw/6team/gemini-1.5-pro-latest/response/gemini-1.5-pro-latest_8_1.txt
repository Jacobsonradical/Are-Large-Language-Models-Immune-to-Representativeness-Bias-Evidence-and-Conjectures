Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:** Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three.  They're more likely to record a day if they happen to pick at least two men taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Focuses on whether a *single* person is taller than 183cm.

**Reasoning**

The key is understanding the distribution of heights. Since 178cm is the average and the distribution is symmetrical, there's a less than 50% chance of a randomly selected man being taller than 183cm.

* **Team 1's Approach:** Increases the odds of getting at least one person taller than 183cm in their sample. Having the middle person be taller than 183cm means at least two out of their three selections were taller.
* **Team 2's Approach:** Directly depends on the probability of a single person being taller than 183cm, which is less likely.

**Conclusion**

Team 1 is more likely to have counted more days where the height requirement was met.

**Answer:**

{team: 1}
