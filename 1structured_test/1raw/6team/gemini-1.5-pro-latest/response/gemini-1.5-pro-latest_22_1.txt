Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1** is looking for the middle person in a group of three to be taller than 183cm. 
* **Team 2** is simply looking for one person to be taller than 183cm.

**Logic**

Team 1's criteria are more restrictive. For their count to increase, they need:

1. At least one person taller than 183cm.
2. Either another person taller than 183cm OR one person shorter than 183cm.

Team 2 only needs to find one person taller than 183cm each day.

**Conclusion**

Since it's more likely to find one person taller than 183cm than it is to find a scenario where the middle person in a group of three is taller than 183cm, Team 2 will likely have a higher count.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
