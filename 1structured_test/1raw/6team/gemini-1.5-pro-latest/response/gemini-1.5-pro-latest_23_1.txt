Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They'll have more 'success' days if at least two out of the three men are taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  Has a simpler criterion â€“ they only need the single person they survey to be taller than 183cm.

**Intuitive Reasoning**

Since Team 1 needs at least *two* people taller than 183cm for a 'success', while Team 2 only needs one, it seems likely Team 2 would have more 'success' days. 

**Why not calculate directly?**

We're not given the exact distribution of heights, only that 178cm is the average and the distribution is symmetrical. Without knowing how many men are actually taller than 183cm, we can't calculate the exact probabilities for each team.

**Answer**

{team: 2} 

**Important Note:** While our intuition suggests Team 2 is more likely to have more 'success' days, without more information about the height distribution, we can't be 100% certain.
