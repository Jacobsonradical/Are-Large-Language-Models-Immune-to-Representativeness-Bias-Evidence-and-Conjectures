{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Focus on the core question:**  The problem is about the likelihood of finding someone taller than 183cm in a random sample.
* **Team 1's ranking is a distraction:** Whether Team 1 ranks the men is irrelevant. They are still just taking a sample of three random men each day.
* **Sample size matters, but subtly:** Team 1 has a larger sample size per day (3 men vs. 1 man). This gives them a slightly higher chance of finding someone over 183cm on any given day. 
* **Law of Averages:** Over 365 days, the slight daily advantage for Team 1 will even out. Both teams are sampling from the same population. Team 2's results will directly reflect the percentage of men taller than 183cm, while Team 1's results will fluctuate slightly around that percentage.

**Conclusion:** While it's possible for one team to be slightly higher, it's highly likely the counts will be within 5% of each other due to the law of averages over a large sample size.
