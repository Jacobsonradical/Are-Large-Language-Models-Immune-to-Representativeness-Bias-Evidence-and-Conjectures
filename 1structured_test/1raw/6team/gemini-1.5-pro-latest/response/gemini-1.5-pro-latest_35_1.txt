Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1** is looking for the probability that in a group of three random men, the middle man's height is over 183cm. 
* **Team 2** is looking for the probability that a single randomly selected man has a height over 183cm.

**Reasoning**

Since the average height of men in the population is 178cm, and the distribution of heights is symmetrical (as many above average as below), 183cm represents a point significantly above average.

* **Team 1:** For the middle person in a group of three to be taller than 183cm, at least two out of the three men must be taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:**  They only need a single man to be taller than 183cm.

**Conclusion**

It's much more likely that Team 2 will encounter more days with a man taller than 183cm because they only need one man to meet the criteria, whereas Team 1 needs at least two out of three.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
