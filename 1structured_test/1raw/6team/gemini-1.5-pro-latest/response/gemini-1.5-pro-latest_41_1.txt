{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams will likely have counts within 5% of each other:

* **Team 2's Approach is More Direct:** Team 2 directly measures what we're interested in â€“ the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183cm. 
* **Team 1's Approach is Indirect (but related):** Team 1's approach is more convoluted. They are looking at the middle person in a group of three. However, for the middle person to be taller than 183cm, at least two out of the three men sampled need to be taller than 183cm.  

**Why they'll be similar:**

While not immediately obvious, the probability of Team 1 having a middle man taller than 183cm is closely tied to the baseline probability of any single man being taller than 183cm (Team 2's approach).  

**Analogy:**

Imagine flipping a coin three times. Team 1 counts how often the middle flip is heads. Team 2 counts how often a single flip is heads.  While the counting methods are different, both will end up close to the true probability of getting heads (50%).

**In Conclusion:**

While there might be small daily fluctuations, over 365 days, both teams are essentially measuring the same underlying probability (the chance of a man being taller than 183cm). Therefore, their counts will likely be within 5% of each other.
