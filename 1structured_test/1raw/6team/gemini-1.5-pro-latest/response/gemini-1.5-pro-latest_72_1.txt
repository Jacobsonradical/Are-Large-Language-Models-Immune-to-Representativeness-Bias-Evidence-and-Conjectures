Here's how to determine the answer:

* **Understanding the Problem:**  We need to figure out if selecting three men and checking the middle man's height against 183 cm is more likely, less likely, or about the same as selecting one man and checking his height against 183 cm.

* **Key Insight:** The crucial factor is the height distribution being symmetrical around the average. Since there are equal numbers of men above and below the average height, the odds of a single randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm are the same as the odds of that man being shorter than 173 cm (5 cm below average).

* **Team 1's Probability:** For the middle man in Team 1's group to be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men must be taller than 183 cm. 

* **Comparison:** It's less likely that two out of three random men will be taller than 183 cm compared to one out of one random man being taller than 183 cm.

* **Conclusion:** Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed individual was taller than 183 cm.

**Answer:** {team: 2}
