{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

While it might seem like Team 1 would have a higher count because they're looking at three men each day, the crucial factor is the height comparison.  

* **Team 1:** They only count the days when the **middle** person's height is above 183cm. This means the tallest person in the group must also be taller than 183cm, making it a more selective condition.

* **Team 2:** They count all instances where the single person they surveyed is taller than 183cm.

Since both teams are drawing from the same population with an even distribution above and below the average height, the probability of finding someone taller than 183cm should be relatively consistent.  Team 1's requirement that the *middle* person be above 183cm makes their count less frequent.

Therefore, the two teams are likely to have counts within 5% of each other over such a long period.
