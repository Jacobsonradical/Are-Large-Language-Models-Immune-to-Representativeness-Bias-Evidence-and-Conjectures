{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the two teams would likely have very similar counts:

* **Team 1 (Middle Man):**  The key here is that Team 1 is focusing on the *middle* person in terms of height. Since the population's height is normally distributed around 178cm, there's an equal chance of the middle person being taller or shorter than average. The fact that they're looking for the middle person to be above 183cm doesn't significantly change the probability compared to...

* **Team 2 (Single Person):** Team 2 is simply looking for *any* person taller than 183cm. 

**In a large enough sample size (365 days is a decent sample), the chances of finding someone taller than 183cm in a random sample of three (and them being in the middle) is going to be very close to the chances of finding one person taller than 183cm in a single random sample.** 

While there might be slight variations, it's highly unlikely that the difference would be more than 5%, especially considering the large sample size.
