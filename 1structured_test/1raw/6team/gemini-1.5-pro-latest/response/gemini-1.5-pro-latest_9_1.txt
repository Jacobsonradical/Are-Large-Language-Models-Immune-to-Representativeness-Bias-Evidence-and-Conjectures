{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

While it might seem like Team 1 would have a higher count because they're sampling three men each day, the key lies in understanding the average and the selection of the *middle* person.

* **Average Height:** The average height of men in the population is 178cm, with an equal distribution above and below this average.
* **Team 1's Selection:** Team 1 focuses on the man with the *middle* height in their daily group of three. This means they are more likely to select men closer to the average height.  
* **Team 2's Selection:** Team 2 has an equal chance of selecting any man, regardless of height.

Since both teams are drawing from the same population, and the height distribution is balanced around the average, the chances of any individual man being taller than 183cm are independent of the sampling method.  Team 1's focus on the middle person doesn't change the overall probability of a man being taller than 183cm within the population.

Therefore, both teams are likely to count a similar number of days where the height requirement is met (within a reasonable margin of error like 5%).
