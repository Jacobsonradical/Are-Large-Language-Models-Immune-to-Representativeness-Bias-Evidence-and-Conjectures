{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1 (Three Men):**  While Team 1 surveys three men, their focus is on the *middle* person's height.  The middle person in a group of three is not necessarily representative of the overall population average. They could pick two tall people and one short person, or vice-versa.

* **Team 2 (One Man):** Team 2 directly measures the factor we're interested in â€“ whether a randomly selected man is taller than 183cm.

* **Probability:**  Both teams are randomly sampling from the same population. Over a long period (365 days), the randomness should even out. Team 1's method of picking three and focusing on the middle doesn't change the underlying probability of a single man being taller than 183cm.

Since both teams are ultimately influenced by the same probability of a man being taller than 183cm, their results are likely to be very similar over such a long period. A 5% difference is a reasonable margin of error considering potential variations in daily sampling.
