Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They are more likely to pick a man of near-average height since the middle person's height is less extreme than the tallest or shortest.
* **Team 2:**  Has a higher chance of picking men who are very tall or very short since they only select one person at random.

**Logic**

Since the average height is 178 cm and the cutoff is 183 cm, we're looking for men who are significantly taller than average. Team 2's method, with its focus on individual selection, is more likely to find these outliers.

**Answer**

{team: 2} 

**Explanation**

While it's not impossible for Team 1 to find middle men taller than 183 cm, Team 2 has a higher probability because they are not limited by the averaging effect of selecting three men and focusing on the middle height.
