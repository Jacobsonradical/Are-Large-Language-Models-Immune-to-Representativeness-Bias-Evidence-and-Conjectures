Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the *middle* person's height in a group of three. They are more likely to pick someone closer to the average height on many days.
* **Team 2:**  Has a chance of picking anyone from the entire height spectrum each day.

**Reasoning**

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there's an equal distribution above and below, a person taller than 183 cm is significantly above average.  Team 1, focusing on the middle person, is less likely to find someone this tall consistently. Team 2, on the other hand, has a higher chance of encountering someone taller than 183 cm on any given day.

**Answer**

{team: 2}
