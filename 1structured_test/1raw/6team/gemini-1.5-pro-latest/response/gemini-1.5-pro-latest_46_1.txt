{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

While it might seem like Team 1 would have more days with the middle person exceeding 183cm (since they have more chances each day), the probabilities even out over time. 

* **Team 1:**  For Team 1 to have a successful count, the middle person needs to be taller than 183cm. This doesn't mean *all* three men need to be taller, just that the middle one is.
* **Team 2:** Team 2 has a direct 1/3 chance each day of picking someone taller than 183cm (assuming a normal distribution of heights around the average).

Over 365 days, both teams are essentially sampling the same population with the same probability of finding someone taller than 183cm.  Minor fluctuations might occur, but it's highly likely the results will be within 5% of each other.
