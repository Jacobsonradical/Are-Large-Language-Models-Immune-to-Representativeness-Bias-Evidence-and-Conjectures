{team: 3} 

**Explanation:**

Here's why the answer is likely 3 (the teams counted about the same number of days):

* **Probability Focus:**  Both teams are ultimately focused on the probability that a randomly selected man from the population is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 1's Complexity is Distracting:** Team 1's ranking system introduces unnecessary complexity. Whether the man taller than 183cm is the tallest, middle, or shortest in their daily sample doesn't change the underlying probability that *a* man is taller than 183cm.
* **Law of Large Numbers:** Over 365 days, both teams have a large enough sample size. Team 1 surveys 1095 men (365 days * 3 men/day), while Team 2 surveys 365. The law of large numbers suggests that with these sample sizes, the variations in daily results should even out, and both teams should arrive at a number close to the true population proportion of men taller than 183cm. 

**In essence, both teams are estimating the same probability through different sampling methods. While there might be slight variations, it's unlikely to be a significant difference (more than 5%).**
