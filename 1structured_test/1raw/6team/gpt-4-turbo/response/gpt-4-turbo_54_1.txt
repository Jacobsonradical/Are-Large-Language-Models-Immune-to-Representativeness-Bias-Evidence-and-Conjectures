To address this question, we first need to consider how the sampling method might influence the results recorded by each team.

1. **Understanding the distribution**: The problem states that the average male height in the population is 178 cm and is symmetric about this mean (as many above as below average). We take this to imply a normal distribution of male heights in the population. To decide the likelihood of encountering men taller than 183 cm (5 cm above the average), an understanding of normal distribution properties is relevant. Generally, a height of 183 cm would be somewhat in the upper tail of the distribution.

2. **Considering Team 1's methodology**: Each day, Team 1 surveys three men and ranks them according to height. The middle man's height would necessarily be the second tallest if ordered in increasing magnitude (or the second shortest if ordered oppositely). This would mean the middle man's height will often be closer to the population mean (178 cm) than the maximum height surveyed on that day. 

3. **Considering Team 2's methodology**: Team 2 samples only one man each day, which means their sampled height each day could vary more widely across the entire range of heights in the population compared to the relatively centered measurement of the middle man's height by Team 1.

Given that 183 cm is above the average height:
- **Team 1**, by focusing on the middle height of three, will more frequently find this figure below 183 cm due to height clustering around the average of 178 cm.
- **Team 2** has a greater variance in daily height observations due to the nature of sampling a different individual height each day, allowing a higher likelihood of occasionally hitting heights significantly greater than the average, such as 183 cm and above.

**Answer**: The outcome should skew to Team 2 observing more days with heights over 183 cm compared to Team 1.
