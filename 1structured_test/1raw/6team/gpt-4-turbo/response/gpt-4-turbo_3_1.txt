{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed individual's height was taller than 183 cm because they sample from the entire population randomly each day without restricting the choice based on relative heights (unlike Team 1, where being the tallest in a sample can affect the outcome). This makes it more statistically probable for Team 2 to encounter men above 183 cm more frequently in their daily random picks.
