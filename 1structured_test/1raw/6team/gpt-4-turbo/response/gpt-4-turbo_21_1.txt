{team: 2}

Explanation: Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with individuals above 183 cm because each day, they survey a man and note if his height exceeds 183 cm. They collect data from one random man without comparing him to others, so their result is strictly about whether the individual is taller than 183 cm or not, directly sampling from the entire distribution of menâ€™s heights.

On the other hand, Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. The middle man's height being above 183 cm would imply that two out of three men surveyed that day are above 183 cm (the middle and the tallest). This scenario is statistically less likely than simply finding one man above 183 cm as in Team 2's sampling method. 

Therefore, Team 2 statistically faces less stringent conditions for counting a day with a man above 183 cm, hence likely ending up with more such counts.
