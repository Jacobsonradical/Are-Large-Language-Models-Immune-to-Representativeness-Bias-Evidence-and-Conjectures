Here's the rationale: If heights are normally distributed (as we might infer from the initial data about heights being above and below average), the probability of randomly selecting a man taller than 183 cm is determined by the distribution of heights above this threshold. 

Team 1 surveys three men daily and picks the middle height. If the distribution were exactly linear or normal around the mean (178 cm), half of the people surveyed would be below 178 cm and half above 178 cm. For the middle height to be greater than 183 cm, at least two of the three surveyed men must be taller than 183 cm. This might seem less likely than just needing one man above 183 cm (as in Team 2â€™s case), however, this method ensures that on the days when two or three surveyed men surpass this height, the middle value is most certainly greater than 183 cm. It strains away lower close values that might just miss the 183 cm mark which could be included more directly in Team 2's single draw result.

Team 2, surveying only one man, has a more straightforward task where exceeding 183 cm is reliant on the single draw. If nearly half the sample population is taller than 178 cm, and a smaller percentage than this surpasses 183 cm, the likelihood per draw aligns with this smaller percentage. 

Considering this information, Team 1's methodology likely captures days where height trends higher among sampled men more efficiently by focusing on median instances where the trend leans significantly over 183 cm. This suggests, perhaps counterintuitively, that Team 1 might have more days where the recorded height hits above 183 cm due to the nature of median selecting in a set of three as compared to random individual picks.
