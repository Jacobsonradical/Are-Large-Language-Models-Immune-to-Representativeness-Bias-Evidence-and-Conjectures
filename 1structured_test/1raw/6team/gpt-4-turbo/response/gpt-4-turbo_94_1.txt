To analyze this problem, we should consider the distribution of the men's heights and the probability of selecting men with heights greater than 183 cm for each team.

1. **Distribution Assumption**: Given that the average male height is 178 cm with an equal number of men taller and shorter than this figure, it suggests a symmetric distribution about the mean (such as a normal distribution).

2. **Height Threshold**: The height of interest, 183 cm, is above the average. We can infer from a symmetric distribution that there is a smaller proportion of men taller than 183 cm compared to those shorter.

3. **Team 1's Approach**: Each day, they sample 3 men and consider the middle-ranked man's height. The middle height is the second tallest if the men are ordered from shortest to tallest. 
   - **Probability of Middle Man Being > 183 cm**: For the middle man to be above 183 cm, at least two of the three sampled men must be taller than 183 cm. This is a more restrictive condition than having at least one man above this height.

4. **Team 2's Approach**: They sample one man each day and check if his height is greater than 183 cm. 
   - **Probability of Sampled Man Being > 183 cm**: This probability is simply the proportion of the population above 183 cm, which is less restrictive than needing at least two out of three men to exceed this height.

5. **Comparative Probability**: From a probabilistic viewpoint, Team 2 is more likely to encounter men above 183 cm more frequently than Team 1, where the condition is stricter (requiring at least two out of three men to exceed this height).

Given these considerations, it is more probable that:
