{team: 2}

Explanation:
Team 1 requires the middle man (out of three surveyed) to be over 183 cm. This condition introduces a statistical constraint that reduces the likelihood that any randomly selected single person (like the middle-ranked man in height in a group of three) will exceed 183 cm. Each day, they effectively filter out the individuals who aren't the tallest or shortest among a set, focusing on the intermediate in height, which statistically is less likely to exceed a taller benchmark like 183 cm.

Team 2, on the other hand, surveys one man at random each day without any comparative ranking involved. The probability that this randomly surveyed man's height exceeds 183 cm depends purely on the proportion of the population taller than this height.

Given the description of the distribution (as many above as below the average height of 178 cm and considering normal height distributions where fewer people tend to be at the extremes), individuals taller than 183 cm make up a smaller segment of the population. However, Team 2 surveys this segment directly each day, without the additional filtering criterion that lowers probability in Team 1's case.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have a larger count of days finding an individual taller than 183 cm than Team 1, as Team 1's sampling strategy introduces a constraint that skews against selecting the tallest individuals.
