{team: 2} 

Team 2 likely recorded more such days where the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm than Team 1. This is because Team 1 selects three men each day and only counts days when the man of middle height exceeds 183 cm, which statistically would happen less frequently. They need to select at least two men over 183 cm to have the middle man's height exceed 183 cm. Conversely, Team 2 surveys just one man each day and counts any instance where the man's height is above 183 cm.
