Given the heights are symmetrically distributed about the mean of 178 cm, half the population will have a height below this average and the other half will be above it.

The key here is comparing how often a man over 183 cm in height would occur in the middle position with Team 1 (which samples randomly three men each day) versus simply being the sampled man with Team 2 (which samples one man each day).

For Team 2, the probability \( P(T_2 > 183) \) corresponds directly to the proportion of men taller than 183 cm in the population.

For Team 1, the process is more involved. When three samples are taken:
1. The lowest of the three is below 183 cm if at least one of the three men is below 183 cm.
2. The highest of the three is above 183 cm if at least one of the three men is above 183 cm.
3. The middle of the three, therefore, being above 183 cm requires specific configurations of the three height outcomes, generally implying at least two men must be above 183 cm.

Given that men over 183 cm are less frequent than those under it, the configuration for Team 1 to have the middle man above 183 cm becomes less likely overall compared to simply finding a man over 183 cm directly as in Team 2's approach. 

While exact calculations could depend on the actual distribution of heights above 183 cm, a general statistical estimate would suggest it's more likely for Team 2 to have more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm because sampling three men and finding at least two of them, or specifically the middle one, over 183 cm generally reduces the probability compared to just finding one man over 183 cm.

Therefore, my reasoned estimation would indicate:

{team: 2}
