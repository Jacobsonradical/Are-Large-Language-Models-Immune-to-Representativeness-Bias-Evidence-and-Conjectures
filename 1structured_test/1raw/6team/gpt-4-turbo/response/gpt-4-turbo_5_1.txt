To answer this query effectively, let's analyze how the heights are distributed and the probability that surveyed men have a height above 183 cm.

First consider Team 2:
- They survey one man each day. We need the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm. This probability will directly translate to how often they encounter someone taller than 183 cm.

Now consider Team 1:
- They randomly select three men each day and rank them by height. The count of interest is how often the man ranked second (middle in height) is taller than 183 cm.
- As we have an average (median) height of 178 cm and equal numbers of men taller and shorter than this, the distribution is fairly symmetrical around 178 cm. The person in the middle (second highest in a sample of three) is likely to be around the average, especially given that the height distribution typically follows a bell curve (normal distribution).

Given that 183 cm is above this average, the likelihood that a randomly selected man (Team 2's scenario) is taller than 183 cm would be the same as the likelihood that the second tallest man in a group of three (Team 1's scenario) is taller than 183 cm. However, since Team 1 is selecting three men, there is a narrower range of heights more consistently centered around the average due to the "average of a sample" effect which pushes the distribution of the middle sample's height closer to the population mean (central limit theorem). Therefore, it's less likely for the middle height to exceed 183 cm compared to any single random draw which could more easily land in the higher tail of the distribution.

Thus:
- Team 2, which samples directly based on the entire distribution, would more often encounter men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1, whose middle-height man must outsize both the population mean and the other two men sampled typically closer to the median.
