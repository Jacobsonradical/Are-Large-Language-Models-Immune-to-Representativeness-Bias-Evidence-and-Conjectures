To address this query, we first consider the assumption mentioned: the average height is 178 cm with an equal distribution on both sides of the average. The specific cutoff for the count is set at a height greater than 183 cm. We infer that the number of men taller than 183 cm in the population is less than half since 183 cm is above the average of 178 cm.

**Team 1** surveys three men each day and looks for the middle height in rank for each of these three. This middle height would only be greater than 183 cm if at least two out of the three surveyed men are taller than 183 cm, making this situation less probable.

**Team 2** surveys one man each day and directly measures if this individual's height is greater than 183 cm. There's a direct chance every day based solely on the proportion of the population taller than 183 cm.

From the setup, it's evident that:
- Each of Team 2’s observations is independent, and directly proportional to the portion of the population above 183 cm in height. 
- For Team 1, obtaining a middle man taller than 183 cm implies at least 2 out of 3 individuals must be above 183 cm, which statistically is a less probable event than just finding 1 out of 1 individuals above 183 cm as in the case for Team 2.

Given that it is more probable for a single random selection to exceed 183 cm than for the middle of three random selections to do so (because of the need for at least two to be above the threshold), **Team 2** statistically should have more days where the surveyed man’s height is above 183 cm compared to Team 1 having the middle man’s height above 183 cm.

Thus, based on this analysis:

{team: 2}
