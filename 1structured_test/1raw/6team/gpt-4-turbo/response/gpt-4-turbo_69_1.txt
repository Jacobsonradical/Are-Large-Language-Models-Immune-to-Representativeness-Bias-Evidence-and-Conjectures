To answer this question, we need to consider the probability distribution of heights and the manner in which the teams are surveying.

1. **Assumption of Normal Distribution and Symmetry**: Since the average height is given as 178 cm with an equal number of men above and below this height, we can reasonably assume that the heights follow a roughly normal distribution centered at 178 cm. 

2. **Key Threshold - Above 183 cm**: Both teams are concerned with counting the number of men taller than 183 cm.

3. **Team 1's Process**:
   - Selects three men at random daily.
   - Ranks them by height.
   - Counts days when the height of the middle man (second tallest) is more than 183 cm.

   Given the symmetric distribution around the mean (178 cm), most of the sampled men's heights will cluster around 178 cm, with fewer men surpassing 183 cm. The chance that the middle-ranked (second tallest) man exceeds 183 cm is relatively lower because it requires at least two of the three men to be taller than 183 cm.

4. **Team 2's Process**:
   - Selects one man at random daily.
   - Directly checks if this man is taller than 183 cm.

   Team 2's task directly measures the proportion of men in the population over 183 cm. There is no requirement of relative ranking that might reduce the chances compared to Team 1's method where the middle rank decreases the likelihood.

5. **Comparison**:
   - **Team 1**: Less likely to count a man over 183 cm on a given day since it relies on choosing at least two men over 183 cm, which statistically reduces the probability of the middle man meeting the criteria.
   - **Team 2**: Each pick has an independent probability equal to the proportion of men above 183 cm. This method should statistically yield a count closer to the true proportion of men above 183 cm in the population.

Given these considerations, **Team 2** is more likely to have counted more days where the man's height was taller than 183 cm. This is primarily because their measurement is not confined by the need of choosing multiple men above a certain height threshold for their count.

**Answer:**
{team: 2}
