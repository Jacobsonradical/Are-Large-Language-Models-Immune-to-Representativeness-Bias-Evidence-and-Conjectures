To approach this scenario, we need to consider the distribution of heights and compare the probability of encountering a man taller than 183 cm in both teams' survey methods.

1. **Distribution Understanding**: Given the symmetry of the height distribution around the mean of 178 cm (as many men are below as are above this average), we can model this as a normal distribution. A key aspect to note is that the mean (average) is not necessarily the only factor in determining how many are above 183 cm; the standard deviation would also influence this, but we don't have those details. We assume for simplicity's sake that the distribution is such that 183 cm is significantly above the average.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For **Team 2**, which samples one man per day, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm directly equates to the proportion of the population above 183 cm.
   - For **Team 1**, which samples three men and then looks at the height of the middle one (second tallest), there is a slightly different dynamic. Even if one of the men is taller than 183 cm, he has to be the second tallest to count for the team's resultsâ€”neither the shortest nor the tallest.

3. **Analyzing Probabilities**:
   - **Team 2** is purely looking for any individual above 183 cm each day, straightforwardly aligning with the fraction of men above this height.
   - **Team 1**, however, is seeking a specific rank (second tallest, or the middle in height), and this can be slightly complicated. If we treat the heights as randomly drawn from a continuous distribution, the individual who is the middle-ranked on any particular day will be more likely from a slightly less extreme part of the distribution than either the maximum or minimum. Thus, the second highest (middle-ranked) being above 183 cm is less probable than just finding one man above 183 cm out of one drawn, as in Team 2's strategy. 

Given that the tallest of three randomly sampled individuals is more likely to be above a specific high threshold than the second tallest, Team 1 is statistically disadvantaged in this task relative to Team 2. Team 2, surveying individuals without the condition of ranking, will generally face lower constraints to meet the >183 cm criterion.

**Conclusion**:
Since Team 2's approach doesn't limit the choice to the middle height of a subset but accepts any height over 183 cm from each individual surveyed, it more straightforwardly fits the condition and should logically count more such days than Team 1.
