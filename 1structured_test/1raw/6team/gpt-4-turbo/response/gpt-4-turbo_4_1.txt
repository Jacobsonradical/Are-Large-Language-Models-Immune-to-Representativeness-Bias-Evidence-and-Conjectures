To analyze which team would have counted more days where the surveyed individuals were taller than 183 cm, we consider the statistical distribution of heights in the population and the methodology used by each team. Given the data:

1. The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
2. The population height distribution is assumed to be symmetric around the mean (median = 178 cm), suggesting it likely follows a normal distribution.
3. The middle height in a random sample of three from a normal distribution is statistically more central in the distribution than a single random draw.

In a normal distribution scenario:
- Heights across men are symmetrically distributed about their mean (178 cm).
- Thus, the proportion of men taller than 183 cm depends on how many standard deviations above the mean this value is.

When Team 2 surveys only one man per day:
- Each daily survey has an equal probability of selecting any man from the population. There's a specific probability \( p \) that this man is taller than 183 cm. This probability is based on the right tail of the distribution beyond 183 cm.

When Team 1 surveys three men per day and assesses the second tallest (middle-ranked) height:
- The middle height is the median of three sampled values from a symmetric distribution.
  - Due to the properties of order statistics, in a normal distribution, the median of three samples is more central than any single random sample from the same distribution. Therefore, the probability that the second tallest (middle-ranked) height exceeds 183 cm is *lower* than the probability of a single randomly picked individual exceeding 183 cm. It essentially pushes the required height into a smaller portion of the tail of the distribution.

Considering these points, the probability each day for Team 1's middle person to exceed 183 cm is less than that of the randomly chosen individual by Team 2. Therefore, over the same number of surveyed days, Team 2 is statistically more likely to count *more* such days than Team 1.

So, using this analytical approach:
