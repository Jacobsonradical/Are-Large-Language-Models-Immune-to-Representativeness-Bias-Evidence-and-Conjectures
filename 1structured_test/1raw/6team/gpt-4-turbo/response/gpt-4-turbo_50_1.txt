To solve this problem, let's consider the statistical distribution and probabilities of sampling.

Given:
1. The average height of men is 178 cm.
2. An equal number of men are taller and shorter than the average.
3. Team 1 samples 3 men each day, ranks them by height, and looks at the middle height to determine if it exceeds 183 cm.
4. Team 2 samples 1 man each day and determines if his height exceeds 183 cm.

It is implied that 183 cm is above the average of 178 cm, thus fewer men will be taller than this mark. We do need to estimate how the distribution of heights might work around that average, but a common assumption in population studies is a normal distribution of a trait like height. 

### Calculating Probabilities:

If in Team 1's samples, the middle height (which effectively is the median height among the three sampled) exceeds 183 cm, it suggests that at least two of the three sampled men on that day are taller than 183 cm. We need to evaluate the likelihood of drawing at least two men taller than 183 cm out of three randomly sampled men.

#### Probability for Team 2:
Let \( P(T > 183) \) be the probability of a randomly picked man being taller than 183 cm. Since more than 50% of the population is below the average of 178 cm and 183 cm is further above this average, \( P(T > 183) \) is perhaps the smaller fraction of the population. If we assume for simplicity a normal distribution and that the heights are effectively symmetric around 178, the percentage exceeding 183 might be significantly smaller, but let's consider it to be `\(\epsilon\)`.

#### Probability for Team 1:
The probability that the median of three randomly selected men is greater than 183 cm relates to at least two of these three being greater than 183 cm. Thus:
- The probability of drawing two men taller than 183 cm is \( \epsilon^2 \).
- The probability of drawing exactly two men taller is \( 3 \times \epsilon^2 \times (1 - \epsilon) \) (since any one of the three can be the one who isn't taller than 183 cm and the other two are).
- The probability of drawing all three men taller than 183 cm is \( \epsilon^3 \).
- Summing these probabilities gives the total chance that the median height exceeds 183 cm.

### Comparing Probabilities:
- Team 2’s count will approximately behave like \( 365 \times \epsilon \), as each draw is independent.
- Team 1’s count embraces the combined probabilities of two or three men above 183 cm which is usually smaller than just one man exceeding that height on any draw. 

### Conclusion:
Given the probabilities and scenario outlined, Team 2 is likely to have more days where the height of the surveyed man is above 183 cm than Team 1, because the single draw situation doesn't need the higher threshold of at least two men exceeding this height.

Thus, the answer is:
{team: 2}
