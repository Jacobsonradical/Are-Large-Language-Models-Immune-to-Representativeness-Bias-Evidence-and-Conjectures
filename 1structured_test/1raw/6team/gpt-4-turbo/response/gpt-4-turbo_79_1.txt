{team: 2}

To reason this:
1. For Team 1, the likelihood that the middle man of the three surveyed men is taller than 183 cm depends profoundly on the probability distribution of the men's heights beyond the defined average (178 cm). Given that the heights would be expected to follow a roughly symmetrical distribution such as a normal distribution around the average (with half above and half below), most heights would cluster around the average.

2. Since each of the three men's heights surveyed by Team 1 are ranked, for any man's height to be the middle value and exceed 183 cm, at least two of the three surveyed heights must exceed 183 cm. This constraint makes it statistically less probable for the middle height to satisfy this condition versus just any random single survey exceeding 183 cm, as is the case for Team 2.

3. For Team 2, each surveyed man is counted independently, so the team simply looks for whether this height surpasses 183 cm without comparison to others. Since it's a single condition not dependent on other sampled individuals, the probability of encountering an individual taller than 183 cm on any given day remains constant and is not influenced by the heights of others. 

4. Statistically, given the information and considering the constraints put by ranking on Team 1's survey method, Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the surveyed man's height surpasses 183 cm.
