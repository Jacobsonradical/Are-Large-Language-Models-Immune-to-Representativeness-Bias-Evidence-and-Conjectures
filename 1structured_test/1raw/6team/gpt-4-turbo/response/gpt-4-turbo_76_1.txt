To analyze this problem, we need a good understanding of how ranking heights in a group of three could affect the results, compared to when only one individual is sampled.

1. **Team 1's Approach:** Every day Team 1 surveys three random men and ranks them by height. For the middle-ranked man to be taller than 183 cm, he essentially needs to be in the top portion of the height distribution. Notice that for the middle-ranked man (out of three) to have a height above a certain value (say x), at least two out of the three sampled men need to have heights exceeding x. This condition reduces the probabilities compared to just a single man exceeding height x.

2. **Team 2's Approach:** Every day Team 2 randomly surveys one man, and checks if his height exceeds 183 cm. Here, the result each day is independent of other results and is simply based on whether the individual man's height is greater than 183 cm or not.

Given the average height is 178 cm and equal numbers of men are above and below this average, it's reasonable to infer a normal distribution around this mean. A height threshold of 183 cm would likely fall into the higher percentiles of this distribution.

**Crucial Insight:**
- In the case of Team 1, for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, it’s more stringent than just one man being taller than 183 cm as in Team 2’s case. This is because two men out of three need to exceed this height for the middle-ranked man to do so.

Based on this reasoning, **Team 1 would generally count fewer days where the middle-height man is above 183 cm because they require at least two men out of three to be taller than 183 cm, which statistically is less probable than the simpler, single individual case of Team 2**.

Thus, I would say:
{team: 2}
