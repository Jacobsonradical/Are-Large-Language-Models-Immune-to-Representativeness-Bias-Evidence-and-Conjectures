To solve this question, let's consider the distribution of heights in the population and how it affects the counting by each team.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There is an equal number of men above and below this average, suggesting a symmetric distribution centered at 178 cm. 

The data-collection task differs between the two teams:
- **Team 1** selects three men randomly each day and ranks them by height. They count how many times the middle-ranked man is taller than 183 cm.
- **Team 2** selects one man randomly each day and checks if his height is greater than 183 cm.

Considering the nature of ranking in statistics:
- When selecting three men and arranging them by height, the middle height tends to be closer to the median of the distribution.
- Since the average (and presumably the median, due to the symmetric distribution) is 178 cm, the middle-ranked man's height in a 3-man sample would generally be close to this value.

However, for a height to be in the middle position and exceed 183 cm in Team 1's sampling:
1. It is likely either the tallest or the second tallest in the distribution comprising values higher than the median/mean.
2. This scenario (where at least 2/3 men are greater than 183 cm in height randomly picked) is less probable than the straightforward task of Team 2, which involves finding any man above 183 cm without the need for comparing with others.

Considering the task setup:
- It is statistically more straightforward for one randomly chosen man to be greater than 183 cm than it is to find at least two out of three randomly chosen men having heights greater than 183 cm to ensure the middle man exceeds 183 cm. 

Thus, **Team 2** is likely to record more days where the height of the surveyed man is greater than 183 cm compared to the number of days Team 1 records the middle man surpassing 183 cm.

Answer:
{team: 2}
