{team: 2}

Explanation:
Team 2 is surveying only one man each day and counting when his height exceeds 183 cm. This approach directly identifies each man over this height threshold without any influence from sampling variability within a small group.

Team 1, on the other hand, ranks three men by height each day and then evaluates the height of the middle-ranked man. Even if one or two of these men are taller than 183 cm, the middle man's height could be less than 183 cm unless all three men surpassed this threshold. This ranking mechanism makes it statistically less likely for the middle man's height to consistently exceed 183 cm as compared to the simple random survey of a single man by Team 2 when considering mean and variance in height distribution. Given the direct measure of Team 2 versus the conditional measure affected by group sampling dynamics in Team 1, Team 2 is likely to have more days counting heights over 183 cm. 

Hence, Team 2 likely counted more such days, focusing merely on how often they encountered men above 183 cm without the added complexity of group dynamics influencing the results.
