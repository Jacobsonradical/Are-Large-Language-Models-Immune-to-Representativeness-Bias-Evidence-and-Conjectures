{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning:
- Team 1 surveys three men per day and ranks them. Only on days when the height of the middle-ranked man is greater than 183 cm does it count towards their total. It's more comparatively uncommon for the middle height in a sample of three taken from a normal distribution to exceed a specific higher threshold since one man would need to be taller, and another could be of any height.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the day if the manâ€™s height exceeds 183 cm. Therefore, they directly sample from the height distribution without the condition of ordering as in Team 1's approach.

Since there's no conditional filtering like in Team 1, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the surveyed man exceeded 183 cm. Team 1's methodology, which depends on the rank, naturally filters out many potential countable days compared to Team 2's straightforward method.
