To determine whether Team 1 or Team 2 likely counted more days where the surveyed individual(s) were taller than 183 cm, let's analyze the scenario based on the information provided and statistical reasoning.

1. **Team 1's Survey Method (Three Men Surveyed Daily)**:
   - Every day, three men are sampled randomly, which means that over a decent sample size (365 days), the heights of these men should reflect the overall distribution of heights in the population.
   - The middle-ranked man in terms of height can be seen as the median height from the three sampled individuals per day.
   - Due to random sampling, each of the three men has an equal chance of being the tallest, shortest, or in between, regardless of their actual height. It depends on the relative comparison among the three sampled each day.

2. **Team 2's Survey Method (One Man Surveyed Daily)**:
   - Each day, only one manâ€™s height is sampled and recorded. This implies that the probability that this man exceeds 183 cm would mirror the probability in the overall man population that height exceeds 183 cm.

3. **Understanding Heights in Relation to 183 cm**:
   - Since the average height is 178 cm, and we assume a normal distribution of heights, individuals taller than 183 cm would lie in one tail of the normal distribution curve, specifically, above one standard deviation if we assume that such measurements typically spread in human height.

4. **Probability Considerations**:
   - In Team 1, the middle man's height being more than 183 cm implies that at least two of the men sampled that day need to be taller than 183 cm (alternative scenarios are complex but generally lower in probability). The probability of picking two men over 183 cm out of three attempts, considering the whole population, is lower than just selecting one man from the population and being over 183 cm as in Team 2's case.

5. **Assessment**:
   - It seems likelier that Team 2 observed more men above 183 cm than Team 1. Team 2's survey procedure directly measures the proportion of the whole population over 183 cm daily without the comparative factor of three sampled heights, which would statistically reduce the chance of consistently getting a middle man over 183 cm due to needed duplication of a higher height.

Thus, the conclusion would be:
{team: 2}
