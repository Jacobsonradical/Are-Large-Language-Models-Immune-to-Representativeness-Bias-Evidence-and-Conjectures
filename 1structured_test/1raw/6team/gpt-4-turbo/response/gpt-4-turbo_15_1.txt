To determine which team might have counted more such days, consider the statistical probability of picking a man taller than 183 cm from the population.

Let's denote the height 183 cm as a threshold above which only a certain percentage of men are taller. Since we are given that the average height is 178 cm and assuming a normal distribution of height, most men will be clustered around 178 cm, and the number of men taller than 183 cm will be fewer.

For Team 1, which surveys three men each day and takes the middle height, the middle height is more likely to be near the average, given the normal distribution. The probability that the middle-ranked man's height exceeds 183 cm will thus depend significantly on the skewness of the distribution in the range above 178 cm, but it can be considered generally lower since two men each day have heights that overlap strongly around the median and mean.

For Team 2, which surveys only one man each day, the probability that this one person exceeds 183 cm is less constrained. They simply check if this randomly selected individual is taller than 183 cm or not. Each selection is independent and identically distributed according to the population distribution, so the likelihood that this one person is taller than 183 cm directly corresponds to the fraction of the population taller than 183 cm.

Given that Team 2 directly samples from the entire distribution each day without a middle-man filtering effect, it's likely that Team 2 would count a number of men above 183 cm closer to the actual proportion of such men in the overall population.

Therefore, without knowing the exact distributionâ€™s characteristics beyond the mean but considering the mechanics of selection and ranking:
{team: 2} is the more likely answer, as Team 2 probably recorded more days where the height of the man surveyed was over 183 cm compared to the selected middle man of three in Team 1.
