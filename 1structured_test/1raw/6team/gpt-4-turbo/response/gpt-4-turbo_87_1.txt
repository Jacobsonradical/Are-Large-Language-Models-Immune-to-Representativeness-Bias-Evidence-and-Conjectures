{team: 2}

Explanation:
Given the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and it's symmetrically distributed around this mean (as many below as above the average), we can infer that the distribution might resemble a normal distribution centered at 178 cm. The critical height of interest, 183 cm, is above this median so fewer men are likely to exceed this height.

Team 1 surveys three men daily and counts days when the middle-ranking man in height terms exceeds 183 cm. This scenario implies that for the middle man to be above 183 cm, at least two of the three surveyed men must be taller than 183 cm, which is statistically less likely considering 183 cm is above the average height.

Team 2 surveys one man each day and simply counts if this person is taller than 183 cm. This method requires only one person to be above 183 cm, which statistically has a higher probability than requiring at least two people to be above 183 cm as in Team 1's strategy.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with surveyed height above 183 cm than Team 1.
