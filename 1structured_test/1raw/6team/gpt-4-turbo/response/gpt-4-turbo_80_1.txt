To solve this query, we need to analyze and compare the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm.

**Team 1's Probability:**
Team 1 samples three men daily and ranks them by height. We need to calculate the probability that the middle-ranked man (the second tallest) is taller than 183 cm. For this man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two of the three sampled men must be taller than 183 cm.

If we let \( p \) be the probability that a single man randomly chosen is taller than 183 cm, then the probability that exactly two men out of the three sampled are taller than 183 cm is given by the binomial formula:
\[ \binom{3}{2} p^2 (1-p) = 3p^2(1-p) \]
and the probability that all three men are taller than 183 cm is:
\[ p^3 \]
So, the total probability that the middle man in Team 1's survey is taller than 183 cm is:
\[ 3p^2(1-p) + p^3 \]

**Team 2's Probability:**
Team 2 surveys only one man each day, and thus the probability that this man is taller than 183 cm is simply \( p \).

**Comparing Probabilities:**
To determine if \( p^3 + 3p^2(1-p) \) is greater than, less than, or approximately equal to \( p \), notice:
1. As \( p^3 + 3p^2(1-p) \) effectively is \( 3p^2 - 2p^3 \) when expanded and simplified, \( p \) must be less than 0.5 since heights are generally normally distributed and 183 cm is likely above the mean (given the information that 178 cm is the mean and assuming a symmetric distribution around this mean).
2. This expanded formula \( 3p^2 - 2p^3 \) (or initial \( p^3 + 3p^2(1-p) \)) will typically be less than \( p \) for typical values (i.e., \( p \) sufficiently small).

Thus, **Team 2** likely counts more days where the man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1, since Team 2 needs only one man to exceed this height rather than a combination of heights among three men.

Therefore, my answer is:
{team: 2}
