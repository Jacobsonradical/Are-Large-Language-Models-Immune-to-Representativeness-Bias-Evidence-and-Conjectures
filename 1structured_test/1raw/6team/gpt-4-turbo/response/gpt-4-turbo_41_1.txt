To address this question, let's analyze the nature of the survey conducted by each team and the statistical probabilities involved.

**Team 1:**
Each day, this team surveys 3 men and ranks them by height. We need to find the probability that the middle ranking (second tallest) man is over 183 cm. The middle man being taller than 183 cm implies that at least 2 out of the 3 surveyed men are taller than 183 cm. 

To determine the probability of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm, additional information about the distribution of heights in the population relative to 183 cm would be necessary (e.g., standard deviation, skewness). However, with the information given and assuming a normal distribution centered at 178 cm with a symmetric distribution of heights:

- There is a 50% chance for a man to be shorter than 178 cm and a 50% chance for a man to be taller. 
- The chance that a man is taller than 183 cm can be assumed to be less than 50% given that 183 cm is significantly above 178 cm.

**Team 2:**
Each day, this team surveys 1 man, and they count the number of days he is taller than 183 cm. The probability of this man being taller than 183 cm is the same probability we sought above for a single man in Team 1's survey.

**Analysis:**
- Team 1 needs at least 2 men taller than 183 cm each day, which implies combinations where 2 or 3 men surveyed are above 183 cm. 
- Team 2 counts any day where the single surveyed man is above 183 cm.

Given the reduced probability of having two men (out of three) above 183 cm each day compared to simply one man exceeding that height, it should statistically be rarer for the middle-ranked man in Team 1's sampling to exceed 183 cm than for the single individual sampled by Team 2 to exceed this height. Thus, the total count of such instances over 365 days is likely to be higher for Team 2 than for Team 1.

Therefore, the answer would be:
{team: 2}
