{team: 2}

Explanation:
Team 1 surveyed three men each day and counted the days when the middle man (ranked 2nd out of 3 in height) had a height greater than 183 cm. Owing to the sorting by height, for the middle-ranked man to be greater than 183 cm, at least two men out of the three surveyed each day must be greater than 183 cm. Given that most height distributions (such as assumed to be nearly Gaussian around 178 cm as per the problem's setup) will have fewer men above a certain point much higher than the average, this situation will be relatively rare.

On the other hand, Team 2 surveyed one man each day with no additional conditions and counted each day the height was above 183 cm. Thus, the probability each day simply depends on the fraction of the population above 183 cm.

Given that the requirement for Team 1 inherently filters for a rarer scenario (requiring at least two out of three surveyed men to be above 183 cm), it is statistically probable that Team 2, facing a simpler criterion of finding any single man above 183 cm, would have counted more such days.
