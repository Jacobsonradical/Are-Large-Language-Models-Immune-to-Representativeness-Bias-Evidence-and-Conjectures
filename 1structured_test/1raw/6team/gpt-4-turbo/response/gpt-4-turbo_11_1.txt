{team: 2}

To determine which team counted more days where the surveyed men were taller than 183 cm, consider the following:

1. Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts days when the middle-ranked man in height is over 183 cm. Given that half of the population is above and half is below the average height of 178 cm, fewer men would likely be above 183 cm. The middle-ranked man from each set of three would typically be closer to the average; hence it's less probable for the median (middle) man to be above 183 cm.

2. Team 2 surveys just one man each day and counts the days when that man is taller than 183 cm. Each man has an independent and equal chance of being taller than 183 cm, irrespective of the daily variations and selections.

Since Team 2 is evaluating the height without the mediation of being the middle value in a set of three (where ordering can push the middle value closer to the average), their probability of encountering men above 183 cm is likely consistent per surveyed individual, and potentially higher than the specific scenario of Team 1, where the second tallest man must be over 183 cm.

Hence, it is more likely that Team 2 recorded more such days.
