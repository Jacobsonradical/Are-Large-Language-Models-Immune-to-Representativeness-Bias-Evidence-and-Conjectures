To determine which team counted more days where the men's height exceeded 183 cm, we need to consider the sampling and ranking process each team follows.

1. Team 1 surveys three men daily and ranks them by height. The count focuses on the middle-ranked man's height for each day.
2. Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days this man's height exceeds 183 cm.

Given that men's height is normally distributed around the average of 178 cm, it's reasonable to assume that heights much greater than the mean (like 183 cm and beyond) represent a smaller proportion of the population.

**Key Insight**:
For Team 1, each day the height of three sampled men are ranked, and due to the symmetry of the normal distribution around the average, the probability of the highest and lowest values being either much below or much above the average is relatively lower compared to the middle value, which is more likely to hover around the median.

Since we are looking at heights beyond 183 cm (well above the average), and the middle value of a normally distributed trait over a small sample (like 3 men) has a higher probability of being close to the mean rather than being at the tail end of the distribution, the results of Team 1 will likely see fewer "above 183 cm" counts compared to Team 2, where each measurement stands alone and has a direct chance.

Given the normal distribution or slight positive skew of men's heights, and considering the method of ranking (which would somewhat more frequently position extremely tall or short individuals as the max or min, leaving average near values in the middle), the single random sample by Team 2 has a comparatively higher chance of hitting above 183 cm more regularly than the middle-ranked individual of three in Team 1.

**Conclusion**:
It is more likely that Team 2 would have counted more such days where the man's height was above 183 cm as compared to Team 1 where the middle height might less frequently exceed 183 cm due to the distribution and ranking methodology.
