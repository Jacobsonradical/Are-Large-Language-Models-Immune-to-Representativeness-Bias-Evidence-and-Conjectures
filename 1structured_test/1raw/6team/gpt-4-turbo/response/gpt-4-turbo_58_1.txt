{team: 2}

Reasoning: Given that the average height in the population is 178 cm and that the number of men above and below this height is equal, it suggests a symmetric distribution around this mean. Although we don't have the exact distribution shape or the standard deviation, we can infer that a height of 183 cm is notably above the mean in this context.

Team 1 samples three men each day and selects the middle height, which might occasionally exceed 183 cm, but the median of a three-sample set from a symmetric distribution centered at 178 cm is more likely to cluster around the mean, particularly because larger heights (like those above 183 cm) will be rarer and typically will not be the median unless all three sampled heights are relatively high.

Team 2, however, samples one man each day without this middle-ranking constraint. Thus, there is a direct, unabated possibility of encountering a man taller than 183 cm on each given day, based solely on the proportion of the population that is taller than 183 cm.

Given this, it's more likely that Team 2, which measures each individual height without needing to be the middle value of a sampled set, would encounter more men over 183 cm across the 365 days compared to Team 1, who selects the median of three daily samples.
