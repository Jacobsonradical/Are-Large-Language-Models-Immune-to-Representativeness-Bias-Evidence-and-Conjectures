{team: 2}

Here is the reasoning:
- Team 1 measures three men each day and counts the days where the height of the middle-ranked man is above 183 cm. Given the statistical distribution of heights (assuming a normal distribution around the mean height of 178 cm), it is less likely that the median of a sample of three will exceed 183 cm, as it requires at least two of the three sampled heights to be above 183 cm for the median to be above this threshold.

- Team 2, on the other hand, measures just one man each day, and the height only needs to exceed 183 cm for it to count. This sampling directly assesses the percentage of the population above 183 cm and does not depend on the relationship between multiple samples.

- Since measuring larger groups (three men by team 1) tends to average out extremes, individual measurements (one man by team 2) are more responsive to variations, making it more likely that Team 2 will count more days where the height exceeds 183 cm compared to Team 1, whose count is moderated by the requirement to have at least two out of three daily measurements exceed 183 cm.
