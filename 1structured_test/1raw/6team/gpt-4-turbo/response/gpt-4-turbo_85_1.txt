To determine which team likely counted more days on which the height of the man (or the middle man in the case of Team 1) was more than 183 cm, we can consider the following analysis:

1. **Distribution of Heights:** Assuming heights are normally distributed around the average, which is 178 cm, fewer people would be taller than 183 cm as it is significantly above the mean.

2. **Team 1's Survey Method:** Every day, Team 1 surveys three men and ranks them by height, selecting the middle height. For the middle height to be greater than 183 cm, at least two of the three men surveyed would need to be above 183 cm. The probability that any randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is less than 50% (as 183 cm is above average) and likely even lower depending on the standard deviation of heights. Consequently, the probability that two out of three randomly selected men are taller than 183 cm is quite low.

3. **Team 2's Survey Method:** Team 2 surveys one man each day, and counts the day if his height is more than 183 cm. The probability here merely depends on the percentage of the total population taller than 183 cm.

**Probability Analysis:**
- Since Team 2 needs only one man above 183 cm to count the day, they have a straightforward condition influenced by how many in the population are taller than 183 cm.
- Team 1, on the other hand, requires that at least two out of three men are taller than 183 cm for the middle height to exceed 183 cm, which statistically is a rarer occurrence considering the unlikelihood of even one man being that tall each draw.

Given that Team 2 only needs one individual to meet the condition versus Team 1 needing at least two, Team 2 would be observing more days where their surveyed height is more than 183 cm.

Thus, the probability of Team 2 recording more days with surveyed heights over 183 cm is higher compared to Team 1, where the criteria depend on the relative height of three individuals.
