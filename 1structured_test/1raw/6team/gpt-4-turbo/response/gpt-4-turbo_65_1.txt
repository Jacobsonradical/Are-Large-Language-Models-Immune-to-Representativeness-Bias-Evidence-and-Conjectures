To answer this question, we need to consider the distribution of male heights in the population and the likelihood of encountering a height above 183 cm given the average height is 178 cm and assuming a roughly symmetric distribution (e.g., normal distribution).

Let's analyze:

1. **Distribution of Heights**: If the distribution is normal, with average (mean) 178 cm, a value of 183 cm is significantly more than the average (by 5 cm). If we consider a typical normal distribution, a distance of 5 cm from the mean (in a normal height distribution) might be around or beyond the third quartile (75th percentile), at least. Thus, there's a significant proportion of the population (potentially around or less than 25%) who are taller than 183 cm.

2. **Team 1's Sampling**: Each day, Team 1 surveys three men and records the height of the middle man by height. The middle value (median) of a sample of three is essentially the second highest value when ordered. The likelihood of this second tallest man being over 183 cm initially seems low unless all three sampled men are from the subset above 183 cm or include outliers from the taller distribution segment.

3. **Team 2's Sampling**: Each day, Team 2 surveys one man. Statistically, they directly sample from the entire population each day, which includes approximately 25% or less who are taller than 183 cm.

Considering this:

- **Team 1** needs a somewhat 'lucky' sample every day where the second tallest out of three randomly selected men exceeds 183 cm. Given the higher cutoff for the middle position surpassing 183 cm, the chances per day diminish compared to sampling individually from the entire population.

- **Team 2** has a consistent proportionate chance based solely on the general population distribution (~25% or slightly less), making it statistically more likely to encounter men above 183 cm more often as they directly mirror the population's characteristic proportion who are taller than 183 cm.

**Conclusion**: Based on the distribution discussed and nature of sampling, Team 2 likely counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm since their sample every day directly reflects the taller part of the population distribution.
