To answer the question, we need to consider the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm and then compare the expected numbers of days with heights greater than 183 cm recorded by Team 1 and Team 2.

Since men's heights are typically assumed to be normally distributed, and it's given that the median (and mean, by symmetry of normal distribution) height is 178 cm, the probability distribution can be assumed to be centered around 178 cm. We can then look at how heights above 183 cm fit into this distribution. Without specific details about the standard deviation and the exact distribution of the heights, we can infer based on typical body height distribution that a height of 183 cm or more would likely be somewhat above the mean. Let's assume it is around the top 20% or so.

For Team 1, which surveyed three men every day and recorded the middle (second tallest) man, we need the middle man's height to be over 183 cm. The scenario occurs if at least two men out of three are taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, the probability that the single man surveyed per day is taller than 183 cm is simpler, as it only depends on one selection rather than the specific rank of height within a group of three.

Considering the additional layer of selection needed for Team 1 (two out of three men must be above 183 cm for the second tallest, the middle man, to be above 183 cm), this makes it statistically less likely for the middle man's height to regularly exceed 183 cm compared to just any single man's height measured by Team 2.

Given this understanding:
- Team 1 encounters the scenario for counting days with middle man's height over 183 cm if and only if at least two men out of the three surveyed are taller than 183 cm, a less frequent event.
- Team 2 encounters the scenario for each man measured over 183 cm, without additional conditions.

It is thus more likely that Team 2 counted more such days when compared to Team 1, as their count relies directly on the higher percentage of just needing one man above that height versus needing at least two of three for a middle value to qualify in Team 1.
