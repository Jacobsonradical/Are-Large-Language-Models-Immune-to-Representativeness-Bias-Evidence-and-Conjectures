To solve this question, we need to consider the implications of the survey techniques and the statistical distribution of heights in this population.

Here's the key point: The middle height recorded by Team 1 on each day is essentially the median of a sample of three randomly selected heights from the population. Since the overall population median (and thus average as stated in the question) is 178 cm, and given that larger samples typically approximate the overall population distribution better, the daily median height in the smaller sample size may sometimes be substantially higher or lower than the population median. However, in general, the median of three will not be as high as average values found by sampling single individuals repeatedly due to the squashing effect of median in smaller samples.

Given that Team 2 is measuring individual heights without taking a median, the height recorded each day varies more freely across the entire range of the population's height distribution.

The key difference is in the distribution's tail behavior â€“ where the heights are greater than 183 cm. Team 2 each day has a direct chance drawn from the full population distribution, so if 10% of the population is above 183 cm, each sample by Team 2 has a 10% chance of being above 183 cm. 

Team 1, sampling three individuals, will only record a day where the median height (the middle of three values) exceeds 183 cm under rarer conditions: this happens only if at least two of the three sampled heights are above 183 cm, which statistically is a lower probability event compared to just needing one height above 183 cm.

Therefore, in all likelihood, Team 2 will count more days where the height is above 183 cm than Team 1, because for Team 1's median to exceed 183 cm, there needs to be a greater concentration of sampled heights above this threshold.

In conclusion:

{team: 2}
