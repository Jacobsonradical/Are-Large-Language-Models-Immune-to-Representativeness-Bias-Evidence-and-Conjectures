To solve this, we need to consider the probability that a man's height is above 183 cm, and how the distribution of height affects each team's chances of encountering such men.

1. **Distribution of Heights**: The given average height is 178 cm, and we know that this distribution is symmetric around the mean (since counts above and below this average are equal). However, we don't know the exact shape of the distribution or the dispersion (like standard deviation) of the heights. To analyze further, we'll assume a normal distribution for simplicity, though this might not be explicitly stated.

2. **Understanding Team 1's Sampling**: Each day, Team 1 samples and ranks three men. The height of the middle-ranked (second tallest) man being above 183 cm is the event of interest. This is a stricter condition because for the middle man to be above 183 cm, at least two of the three sampled men must be above 183 cm.

3. **Understanding Team 2's Sampling**: Team 2 each day just counts if the one man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm. This is a direct sampling from the population, looking just at whether one individual surpasses the 183 cm threshold.

4. **Probability Considerations**: Assuming normal distribution allows us to infer certain probabilities:

   - For Team 1, to find the middle man taller than 183 cm, the probability calculation gets complex as it depends on finding at least two men out of three sampled to be above this height. This involves combination calculations and integrating the tail probabilities beyond 183 cm of the normal distribution.
   
   - For Team 2, the probability is more straightforward and is the probability that a randomly selected man from the population is taller than 183 cm.

Given the setup, **Team 2 has a higher probability of counting more men above 183 cm each day.** This owes to their task only needing one man above 183 cm, regardless of however many might be below this threshold. In contrast, Team 1 needs at least two men to be substantially tall for the middle one to qualify, making it a rarer event relative to Team 2's scenario.

Therefore, the answer can be:
{team: 2}
