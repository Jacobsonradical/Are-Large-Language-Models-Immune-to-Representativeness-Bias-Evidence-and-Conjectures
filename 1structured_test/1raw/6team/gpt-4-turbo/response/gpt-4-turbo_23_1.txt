To analyze the problem, we start by understanding the distribution of heights among the men in the population. Given the average (mean) height is 178 cm and there's an equal number of men taller and shorter than this average, the distribution can be assumed to be symmetric around 178 cm, approximating a normal distribution. 

1. For Team 1, which surveys three men daily and ranks them by height, the middle height is the median of three sampled heights each day. To determine how often this median height exceeds 183 cm, consider that for the median (second tallest in a sample of three) to be over 183 cm, at least two of the three men surveyed per day must be taller than 183 cm. We don't know the exact distribution, but knowing that 183 cm is well above the mean (178 cm) suggests that significantly fewer than half of the population exceeds this height. 

   Probability distributions and order statistics suggest that the probability of the median of three sample heights exceeding 183 cm would occur less frequently because having at least two out of three sampled individuals above a certain higher threshold (here 183 cm) is relatively low given our understanding of the normal distribution around 178 cm.

2. For Team 2, which surveys one man each day, the probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm is directly the proportion of the population taller than 183 cm. Since 183 cm is notably higher than the average, this proportion would be straightforward, but less likely as it requires that the single individual surveyed each day be above this threshold.

Based on this analysis:
- Team 1â€™s probability depends on a combined outcome favorable for two out of three people in a single sampling event, which statistically is a less likely scenario compared to just needing one person (sampled by Team 2) being taller than 183 cm.
- Team 2, sampling individuals independently each day, has a direct relationship with the actual proportion of the population over 183 cm. Thus, they have a greater or equal likelihood of finding a person over 183 cm on any day compared to the complex condition needed by Team 1.

Therefore, Team 2 has a higher or at least the same probability of counting more days with individuals over 183 cm compared to Team 1. If the deviations due to sampling variation are minor, the count might be close but still favors Team 2 or is about the same given the high threshold set at 183 cm.

Given this understanding and the options provided, the answer would be:

{team: 2}
