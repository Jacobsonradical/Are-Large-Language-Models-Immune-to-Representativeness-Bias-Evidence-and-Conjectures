To solve this question, we need to consider how the selection process in each team affects the probability of selecting men with a height greater than 183 cm.

1. **Probability of an Individual Man's Height Exceeding 183 cm:** This is needed for Team 2's analysis. Given that the average height is 178 cm, and assuming a normal distribution, the heights symmetrically distributed about this average. Let's estimate, without additional specific information on standard deviation or the precise distribution shape, that the height 183 cm is significantly above average (perhaps in the upper 5-10% of the distribution).

2. **Team 1's Probability Evaluation:** Each day, Team 1 surveys *three* men, ranks them, and notes if the middle (second tallest) man is taller than 183 cm. For the middle man to exceed 183 cm, generally either all three men must be tall, or at least two of them. The likelihood of picking three men, all of whom are taller than the average and near or above 183 cm, is less than picking one man above 183 cm, because the more individuals you select, the more likely it is to include a variety among them.

3. **Team 2's Probability Evaluation:** Each day, Team 2 selects one man and checks if his height exceeds 183 cm. Since it is a single random draw, the chance of drawing a man taller than 183 cm is more likely than the more specific scenario required by Team 1 (the middle rank man from a group of three needing to exceed 183 cm).

**Conclusion:**
Given Team 2 is only looking for one man above 183 cm, whereas Team 1 needs a specific order-related outcome among three men surveyed each day, Team 2 has a statistically higher chance of recording more days with men above 183 cm. 

The counting under Team 1â€™s condition seems more restrictive compared to Team 2's condition, making it less likely to occur as frequently.

Therefore, the response is:
{team: 2}
