To answer the question, let's first examine the distribution of the heights and then consider the survey strategies of Team 1 and Team 2.

1. **Distribution Assumption**: Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and there are as many men above this height as there are below, it's reasonable to assume the height distribution is roughly symmetric around this mean. 

2. **Height Benchmark**: The key height benchmark to consider is 183 cm, as this is the threshold both teams are assessing against.

3. **Survey Details**:
    - **Team 1**: Every day they sample 3 men and then look at the middle-ranked man by height. Since the middle man's height on each day will depend on the specific sample of 3, this introduces sampling variability. However, given the nature of the median and a symmetric distribution assumption (normal distribution can be a rough guideline here), the middle man's height should be close to the population median, which is 178 cm. Because 183 cm is likely above the median (and hence in the upper segment of the distribution), only a smaller proportion of sampled middle-men will exceed 183 cm.
  
    - **Team 2**: Each day they sample just 1 man. This man's height has an equal probability of being anywhere in the distribution (above or below 178 cm). The probability of surveying a man above 183 cm depends directly on the proportion of the population taller than 183 cm.

4. **Probability Estimates**: If we assume normality from the symmetry hint (not specified, but let's go with this for approximation):
    - *Mean* = 178 cm
    - Letâ€™s roughly estimate that 183 cm is right around or slightly above 1 standard deviation above the mean (since population heights are often normally distributed). In a standard normal distribution, about 16% of values lie above one standard deviation from the mean.

5. **Comparative Analysis**:
    - **Team 1** surveys effectively reduce actionable results on heights specifically for the middle man, whose height is typically close to the median. Thus, the likelihood of the middle man exceeding 183 cm should theoretically be less than the probability of a random man from Team 2 exceeding 183 cm, given that the latter does not depend on the restricted position within a sample.
  
    - **Team 2** sees each individual's height as fully independent of others hence more likely on average to get heights over 183 cm, based accurately on the proportion of such men in the whole population.

**Conclusion**:
Given the design of these surveys and the notion of average and variability as discussed, Team 2, over the long term and many samples, would normally expect to find more instances of men over 183 cm than Team 1, who is relying on the middle value from a small and potentially variably skewed sample each day.
