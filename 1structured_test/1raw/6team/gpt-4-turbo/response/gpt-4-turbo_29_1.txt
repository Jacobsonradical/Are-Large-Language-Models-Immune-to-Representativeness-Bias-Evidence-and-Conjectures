To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of randomly selected men having heights greater than 183 cm. Since the probability distributions or specifics regarding heights aren't explicitly provided apart from the average height being 178 cm, we'll reason based on what typical distribution might look like - often, human heights follow a normal distribution around the mean.

We'll need to evaluate the difference between the scenarios faced by Team 1 and Team 2. 

Team 1 surveys three men every day and evaluates the middle man in terms of height. For the middle height to be greater than 183 cm, at least two of the three surveyed men must be taller than 183 cm (if all three were shorter, or only one was taller, the middle value would inevitably be less than 183 cm). The key here is that having two out of three randomly selected individuals exceed a specific height imposes a more restrictive condition than just one person exceeding that height, as in Team 2â€™s case. Given this, it becomes less likely that the middle height frequently exceeds 183 cm compared to any randomly chosen individual's height exceeding 183 cm.

On the other hand, Team 2's task each day involves surveying a single man and noting whether his height exceeds 183 cm. This scenario is straightforward and solely depends on the distribution's probability for an individual being taller than 183 cm, which is comparatively higher in occurrence than finding at least two out of three men exceeding this height.

Based on this simplified analysis, it appears more likely that Team 2 would count more days with men taller than 183 cm than Team 1. Hence, we can presume:

{team: 2}
