To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of selecting men whose height is taller than 183 cm and the methodology used by each team.

1. **Team 1:**
   Each day, this team selects three men at random and ranks them by height. They then count the days when the middle-ranked man (the second tallest) has a height greater than 183 cm. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men must have heights greater than 183 cm. 

2. **Team 2:**
   Each day, this team selects only one man at random. They count the days when this man's height is taller than 183 cm.

Since half of the population is above the average height (178 cm), the next thing to determine is the distribution of the heights and specifically the proportion with heights above 183 cm. However, without explicit data on the distribution of heights above the average, we must rely on reasonable assumptions or simplifications.

Assume the heights are normally distributed (a common assumption in population studies for characteristics like height). Given the average height is 178 cm and there are equally many people shorter and taller than this mean, and knowing that usually only about one standard deviation from the mean covers 68% of data in a normal distribution around the mean, we can roughly speculate that 183 cm might be somewhat significantly above the average, e.g., above the 75th percentile.

This would mean:
- For **Team 1**, there is a significantly lower chance that at least two men out of three randomly sampled men will both be taller than 183 cm in comparison to just finding one man above 183 cm. Each individual higher height reduces the probability for the group requirement.
- For **Team 2**, each day's test is independent, and they simply measure whether this single randomly-selected individual is taller than 183 cm, which should have a straightforward probability, let's roughly estimate it close to 25% (assuming 183 cm is notably taller than 178 cm).

Thus, **Team 2** likely counted more days with heights over 183 cm than **Team 1** because Team 1 needed at least two out of three men above 183 cm to count the day, which is statistically less likely.

Based on this analysis, the answer is:
{team: 2}
