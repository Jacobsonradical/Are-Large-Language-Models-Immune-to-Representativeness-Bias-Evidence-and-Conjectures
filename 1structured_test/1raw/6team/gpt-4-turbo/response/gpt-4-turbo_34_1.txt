{team: 2}

Explanation:
Considering that the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric around this average (as many men taller as shorter), let's assume a normal distribution of heights. Men who are taller than 183 cm represent a tail of this distribution.

- Team 1 surveys three men daily and ranks them by height. For the middle-ranked man (rank 2 in sampled height) to have a height greater than 183 cm, all three surveyed men must be at or higher than taller height ranges, which has a lower probability due to the fewer number of men above 183 cm.

- Team 2, surveying one man daily, their observed height data isn't conditioned on the heights of other surveyed men. Their data is more straightforward - a direct observation if the single surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.

Given the nature of distribution and surveying method, Team 2 would have more days where their one surveyed man's height was above 183 cm because each day's result is independent and directly related to the higher tail of the height distribution.

In contrast, for Team 1, the height of the second man in a ordered group of 3 being above 183 cm is less probable, given that many combinations of the three men will result in the second tallest being under 183 cm even if one or two might be over. Thus, Team 2 will likely record more days counting men above 183 cm.
