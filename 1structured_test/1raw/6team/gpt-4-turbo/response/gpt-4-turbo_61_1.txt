To analyze this question, we need to consider a few key statistical points.

1. **Distribution Characteristics**: The height of men is given as normally distributed with an average (mean) of 178 cm. The statement that "there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average" confirms a symmetric distribution about the mean. However, to move forward, we also should know or assume where 183 cm stands in this distribution.

2. **183 cm height relevance**: Since 183 cm is not stated explicitly in reference to any percentile, we typically assume it to be somewhat above the mean given that the mean is 178 cm.

3. **Sampling and Ranking by Team 1**: Each day, Team 1 samples three men and then ranks them. The middle man's height is critical for their count. The middle height (second tallest) in a sample of three randomly chosen men would be generally closer to the mean population height compared to either the maximum or minimum of the sample due to its position in the order statistics.

4. **Team 2's Single Sample**: Team 2 samples one man each day which statistically reflects the entire population's characteristics. The question then is what portion of the population exceeds 183 cm. 

Given our assumptions on the height distribution:
- If 183 cm is assumed to be above average but not extremely far from the mean, a considerably smaller portion of the population would exceed this value.

Statistical Insight into Sampling:
- **For Team 1**: The odds that the second tallest out of three randomly chosen individuals exceeds 183 cm would generally be less than the single sampled individual exceeding 183 cm because the second tallest is less likely to be far above the average than a single random sample from a large population where outliers (both low and high) are more prevalent.
- **For Team 2**: Direct probabilistic reflection of how many in the population exceed 183 cm.

Given these considerations:
- It is more likely that each day, the single randomly sampled man from Team 2 has slightly higher probability of exceeding 183 cm than the middle-ranked man of three from Team 1, as the former captures more extreme cases from the population tail.

Hence, under the assumption of a relatively standard distribution where 183 cm is above average but does not extremely deviate from the mean:
- Team 2 would more likely count more days with height taller than 183 cm than Team 1.

Therefore, the answer would be:
{team: 2}
