To answer this question, we need to consider how the distribution of heights influences the number of days each team counts a man taller than 183 cm.

1. **Distribution of Heights**: Given that the average height of men is 178 cm and the number of men above and below this average is equal, we can assume a symmetric distribution around the mean. Heights exactly at 178 cm serve as the median.

2. **Height Threshold of 183 cm**: The threshold of 183 cm is clearly above the average (and presumably the median), meaning that a smaller proportion of the population exceeds this height.

3. **Team Data Collection**:
   - **Team 1** surveys three men every day, ranks them, and checks if the height of the middle man (second tallest) is more than 183 cm. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two of the three surveyed men must be taller than 183 cm. The probability that any random man is taller than 183 cm is less than 50% (since 183 cm is above the mean and median).
   - **Team 2** surveys one man each day and counts if that man is taller than 183 cm. The spread might be simpler here; they donâ€™t need multiple instances to influence their data; one man taller than 183 cm per day is directly noted.

4. **Statistical Probabilities**:
   - The probability that a single surveyed man (team 2's daily survey) is taller than 183 cm is simpler and more straightforward compared to needing at least two men out of three (team 1) being taller than 183 cm.

Given this examination, **Team 2** is more likely to have counted more days where a man is taller than 183 cm simply due to direct daily measurement without a need for multiple instances to exceed the threshold each day.

Hence, the final response is:

{team: 2}
