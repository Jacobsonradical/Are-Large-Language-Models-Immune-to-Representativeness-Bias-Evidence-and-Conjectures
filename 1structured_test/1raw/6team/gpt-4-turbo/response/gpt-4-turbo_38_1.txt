{team: 2}

Hereâ€™s the reasoning: If we consider the distribution of male heights in the population to be symmetric around the mean (178 cm), then people with heights greater than 183 cm would be in one tail of the distribution. Given the symmetry, those less than 173 cm would occupy the other tail. Since the height of 183 cm is quite above the mean, the proportion of men above this height in the population is likely less than 50%. 

When Team 1 surveys three men daily and ranks them, it's looking specifically for the middle ranked man. For this middle man to have a height over 183 cm, at least two of the three men surveyed need to have heights over 183 cm. This is less probable than just finding one man over 183 cm, as Team 2 is looking for.

Thus, it is more likely that Team 2, which needs only one man out of one each day to exceed 183 cm in height, counted more such days than Team 1, who requires at least two out of three men to exceed that height daily for it to count. Hence, Team 2 likely has a higher count of days with men taller than 183 cm.
