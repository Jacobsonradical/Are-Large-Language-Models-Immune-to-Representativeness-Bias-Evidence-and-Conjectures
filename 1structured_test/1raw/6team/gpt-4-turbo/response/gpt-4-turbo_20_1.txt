To determine which team counted more days when someone's height was over 183 cm, we need to analyze the probability scenarios of both teams and then compare these.

### Team 1:
Team 1 samples three men daily and counts how many days the man ranked second in height among the three surveyed exceeds 183 cm. The probability that an individualâ€™s height exceeds 183 cm depends on the distribution of height in the population. Let's say the percentage of men in the population whose height is over 183 cm is \( p \). 

In order for the middle height (ranked second among three) to exceed 183 cm, at least two of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm. The scenarios in which this occurs are: 
- Two men are taller than 183 cm and one is not, or
- All three men are taller than 183 cm.

Using the binomial probability formula, this can be computed as:
\[ P(\text{2 or 3 men > 183 cm}) = \binom{3}{2} p^2 (1-p) + \binom{3}{3} p^3 = 3p^2 - 2p^3 \]

### Team 2:
Team 2 samples one man each day and counts how many days this man is taller than 183 cm. The probability that the sampled man is taller than 183 cm is simply \( p \).

### Comparison:
We compare \( 3p^2 - 2p^3 \) against \( p \). Without specific values for \( p \), we can reason about the magnitudes:
For reasonable values of \( p \) (where \( p \) denotes men taller than 183 cm and is likely a small probability since 183 cm is considerably above the mean of 178 cm, and given a roughly normal distribution, \( p \) might be expected to be in the tail):

1. \( 3p^2 \) increases the impact of a smaller \( p \) by squaring it but multiplying by a small whole number.
2. \( -2p^3 \) is very small since it is the cube of already small \( p \).
3. \( p \) alone is straightforward and unaffected by the square or cube scalings seen in \( 3p^2 - 2p^3 \).

Given the above, \( p \) (Team 2's probability) is likely to be higher than \( 3p^2 - 2p^3 \) (Team 1's probability) unless \( p \) approaches a value close enough to make \( 3p^2 \) and \( -2p^3 \) more significant and closer to \( p \), yet still likely smaller due to the negative cubic term.

### Conclusion:
It is more likely that Team 2 counted more such days than Team 1. Hence, the response will be:
{team: 2}
