To approach this question, consider the distribution of heights within the population. The average height is 178 cm, and it is given that there are as many men above this average as there are below it. Thus, we can assume a fairly symmetric distribution of heights around this average. 

The crucial element in assessing which team might count more men taller than 183 cm comes from understanding the selection process and typical results for ranking.

For Team 1, who surveys three men each day and ranks them, the height of the middle-ranked man to be above 183 cm suggests that at least two men surveyed that day are above 183 cm. Given a normal distribution of heights, the probability of randomly picking men taller than 183 cm (which is markedly higher than the average of 178 cm) is lower than picking any below that height. So, it is statistically less likely for two out of three randomly surveyed men to be above 183 cm frequently enough for the middle man to often exceed 183 cm.

Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man each day and counts any day where this man's height exceeds 183 cm. The probability of picking a man taller than 183 cm is not dependent on his rank among others—as is the case with Team 1—but purely on the distribution of heights in the population.

Given these situations, the probability of encountering a man above 183 cm is theoretically the same for each individual man surveyed by both teams. However, since Team 1 needs at least two men to be above 183 cm to ensure the middle man exceeds this height, this scenario will likely occur less often compared to the Team 2 scenario, where only one man's height needs to exceed 183 cm.

Now we interpret the results:
1. Team 1 requires at least two men (out of three) taller than 183 cm for the middle man to exceed 183 cm, a less likely scenario.
2. Team 2 only requires that the single man they survey per day is taller than 183 cm.

Considering these probabilities, Team 2 is more likely to have more days where the surveyed individual is taller than 183 cm as there is no additional constraint like that in Team 1. 

Therefore, {team: 2}
