To analyze this problem, we need to consider how often a man taller than 183 cm would emerge in each team's daily survey, under the assumption that height is normally distributed around the mean (178 cm) with an equal number above and below this mean.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. The probability that the middle man (ranked second in height) is taller than 183 cm depends on the overall proportion of the population taller than 183 cm. For him to be the middle height, at least one of the men must be shorter than him. Given the mean height is 178 cm, fewer people are expected to be above 183 cm. Hence, those taller than 183 cm would less frequently be in the middle position due to the natural skew towards shorter heights from the mean.

Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man each day, and the measurement simply needs to exceed 183 cm. The probability of randomly picking a man taller than 183 cm is equivalent to the proportion of such individuals in the overall population.

Given that heights are symmetrically distributed around the mean of 178 cm, fewer men will be above 183 cm. Therefore, for Team 1, the middle man of three being taller than 183 cm is less likely than just picking one man who exceeds that height, since it requires not only one man being above 183 cm but also having another one of lesser or equal height below him to still be the middle.

The complexity of Team 1's survey method, demanding a specific rank order for over-183 cm tall men within a group of three, mathematically decreases the frequency of such observations compared to Team 2's straightforward method of selecting any individual who meets the >183 cm criterion.

Thus, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the manâ€™s height was taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
