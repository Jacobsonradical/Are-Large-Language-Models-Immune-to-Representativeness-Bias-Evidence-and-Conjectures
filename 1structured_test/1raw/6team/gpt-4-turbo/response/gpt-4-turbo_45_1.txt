{team: 2} 

Analysis:
- Men sampled by each team are done so randomly from the same population.
- The median height for this population is 178 cm. Therefore, about half the men are taller than this height, and half shorter.
- The question then concerns the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm.
- Let's assume the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is p (where p is likely less than 0.5 since 183 cm is substantially above the median height of 178 cm).

For Team 1:
- Every day, they survey three men and rank them by height. They count the number of days the middle height (second tallest) is above 183 cm.
- The chance that the middle height man is over 183 cm significantly on a specific day depends on the chances of picking at most one man below 183 cm out of the three. This is probabilistically less frequent given the overall proportion of men over 183 cm (p) is likely small.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they survey one man and check if he's taller than 183 cm.
- The chance that this man is taller than 183 cm is simply p.

Since Team 2's measurement relies directly on the proportion p without the further filtering effect in the sorting process that Team 1 must do, Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height of the surveyed man is over 183 cm.
