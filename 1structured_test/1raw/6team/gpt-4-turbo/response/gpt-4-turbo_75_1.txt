To solve this query, we need to understand the probability distribution of heights and how the setup of each team affects their counts.

1. **Height Distribution Assumption**: Because the average height of men is 178 cm and this average equally splits the population into taller and shorter halves, we can infer a symmetric distribution about the mean. The simplest symmetric distribution to consider here is a normal distribution, though the actual shape or variance isn't strictly known. 

2. **Probabilities**:
    - Since half the population is above 178 cm, the proportion of people above any height (X) above 178 cm is 0.5 or less. To determine the proportion of men above 183 cm in such a symmetric distribution, we speculate that it's considerably less than 0.5 given 183 cm is significantly higher than 178 cm. However, without knowing the exact standard deviation or variance, this exact probability is unknown but assumed relatively low (for example, if we approximate with a rough guess or use normal distribution parameters from wider population statistics).

3. **Team 1's Survey Setup**:
    - Each day, Team 1 surveys three different men and ranks these men by their heights. The crucial factor is the height of the middle-ranked man. The probability that the middle man's height exceeds 183 cm is less than the probability that at least one of the three chosen men is above 183 cm. Additionally, for the middle manâ€™s height to exceed 183 cm, at least two men must be above 183 cm, which is considerably rarer than just one man being above this height.

4. **Team 2's Survey Setup**:
    - Each day, Team 2 surveys only one man, and they count if this man's height is over 183 cm. Their calculation per day directly relates to the population fraction of men above 183 cm.

5. **Comparative Probability**:
    - The probability of finding at least one man above 183 cm (the case for Team 2) is consistently higher than finding that precisely the second-out-of-three men surveyed ranks over 183 cm daily (the scenario for Team 1). This alone suggests that Team 2 will likely have a higher count than Team 1 over the same period, dealing with fewer statistical layers affecting the result.

From this analysis:
