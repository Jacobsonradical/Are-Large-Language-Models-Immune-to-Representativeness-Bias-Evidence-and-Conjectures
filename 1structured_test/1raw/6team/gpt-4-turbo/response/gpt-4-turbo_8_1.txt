To determine which team counted more days where the height was over 183 cm, we consider the sampling methods and statistical distributions involved.

**Understanding Team 1's method:**
Team 1 selects three random men each day and ranks their heights. For the height of the middle-ranking man to be more than 183 cm, at least two of the three men must have a height greater than 183 cm on any given day. 

**Understanding Team 2's method:**
Team 2 selects one man each day and records if his height is more than 183 cm.

**Statistical Consideration:**
We are given that the average height is 178 cm and that the distribution of heights is symmetrical around this average (as many above as below). However, the exact height distribution and the proportion of the population above 183 cm are initially unknown. If we assume a normal distribution around the mean (which is not explicitly given but can be inferred from the type of data distribution information provided), then we need to calculate or estimate the proportion of the population taller than 183 cm. Let's assume heights are normally distributed. 

Given the symmetry and the existence of a mean at 178 cm, heights distributed further from the mean, such as 183 cm, will comprise a smaller section of the population. In a normal distribution, the further a value is from the mean, the lower its frequency (proportion of the population).

**Team 1**: The event where the middle man is taller than 183 cm implies a higher threshold because two men need to be taller than 183 cm.
**Team 2**: Simply records if one man (randomly selected) surpasses this threshold.

**Probability Calculation Simplification:**
- For Team 1, finding two out of three men above 183 cm is statistically less likely than finding just one man (as surveyed by Team 2) above 183 cm on average. Mathematically, the probability of the middle man being over 183 cm (two or three men being taller than 183 cm among three sampled) is significantly lower than the probability of one randomly picked man being over 183 cm.

Based on this reasoning:
- **Team 2** will generally count more days with a height greater than 183 cm since their criterion involves only a single measurement rather than the compounded condition of having at least two out of three measurements exceed 183 cm.

So, the final answer would be:
{team: 2}
