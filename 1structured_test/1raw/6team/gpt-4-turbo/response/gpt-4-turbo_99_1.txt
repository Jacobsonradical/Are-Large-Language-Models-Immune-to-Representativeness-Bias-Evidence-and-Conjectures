To solve this problem, let's consider a few key points about the distribution of heights and probabilities:

1. The average height of men in the population is 178 cm. We are also told that the population has as many men above as below this average, suggesting a symmetric distribution of heights around the mean 178 cm.

2. Both teams are counting the number of days where they encounter men taller than 183 cm.

3. Team 1 samples three men randomly each day and looks for days when the height of the middle-ranked man (second tallest) exceeds 183 cm.
4. Team 2 samples one man each day and directly checks if his height exceeds 183 cm.

We need to assess the different probabilities:

- For Team 2, the probability of picking a man taller than 183 cm is the proportion of the population above this height. Given the symmetry and the average well below 183 cm, this is likely a small proportion though we don't know exact figures.

- For Team 1, the situation is more complex because they survey three men, and the second tallest must be taller than 183 cm. For this to occur:
  - At least two of the three chosen men need to be over 183 cm.
  - The exact distribution behavior beyond 178 cm is necessary but unspecified; however, if we assume normality or a similar symmetry around the mean, heights of 183 cm or more might represent the taller tail.

To compare the probabilities:
- The probability of one man exceeding 183 cm picked by Team 2 is \( p \) (where \( p \) is the proportion of population over 183 cm).

- For Team 1, the probability that at least two men out of three exceed 183 cm involves combinations of probabilities for choosing two or three tall men, and can be calculated (in a rough, conceptual way without exact numbers) using combinations and the probability \( p \). This would be given by: 
\[ P(\text{at least 2 out of 3 exceed 183}) = \binom{3}{2}p^2(1-p) + \binom{3}{3}p^3 \]
This effectively means:
\[ = 3p^2 - 2p^3 \]
Since \( p \) (tall men above 183 cm) is likely a small number given the mean, \( p^2 \) and especially \( p^3 \) are smaller (thus making \( 3p^2 - 2p^3 \) smaller compared to \( p \) itself).

Hence, it is more probable for Team 2 to encounter men taller than 183 cm more often than Team 1 will find the second tallest man above 183 cm in a group of three. This is due to reducing probability effects as more men are sampled simultaneously with the condition that more than one must exceed the height threshold.
