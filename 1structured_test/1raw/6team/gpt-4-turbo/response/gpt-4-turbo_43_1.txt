To solve this question, we need to consider the probability distribution of men's heights and understand how the selection and ranking process affects the counts for each team.

1. **Height Distribution**: 
   The average height of the men is 178 cm, with equal numbers above and below this average, suggesting a symmetric distribution around this mean (e.g., normal distribution might be a reasonable assumption).

2. **Height Greater Than 183 cm**:
   The proportion of men above 183 cm isn't directly provided, but since 178 cm is the mean and given the entire population's height is symmetric about this mean, those significantly above the mean (like 183 cm) will represent a smaller section of the distribution tail. Let's denote the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm as `P(H > 183)`.

3. **Team 1's Process**:
   Each day, Team 1 picks 3 men at random and ranks them by height. The middle man (second tallest) being more than 183 cm implies at least two out of three randomly selected men must be taller than 183 cm.
   - For two specific men to be taller than 183 cm and one not, the probability is `P(H > 183)^2 * (1 - P(H > 183))`.
   - Since the men are picked randomly, there are 3 choose 2 (or 3) ways this can happen, so the required probability becomes `3 * P(H > 183)^2 * (1 - P(H > 183))`.
   - Additionally, the scenario where all three men are taller than 183 cm also qualifies, which is `P(H > 183)^3`.
   - Therefore, the probability Team 1 finds the middle man taller than 183 cm is `3 * P(H > 183)^2 * (1 - P(H > 183)) + P(H > 183)^3`.

4. **Team 2's Process**:
   Team 2 samples one man each day, so their count is simply `P(H > 183)` per day.

5. **Comparing Probabilities**:
   - `P(H > 183)` for Team 2 is the basic probability that a single random man exceeds 183 cm.
   - The probability for Team 1 involves higher powers and multiplications of `P(H > 183)`, meaning its value will generally be less than `P(H > 183)`. Hence, Team 2's daily probability is higher than Team 1's adjusted probability considering the conditions stated.

Conclusively, **Team 2** likely counted more days where the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm simply because each investigation had an independent and undiluted chance of encountering a man taller than 183 cm, compared to the conditional probability computation required by Team 1.

Hence, the answer is:
{team: 2}
