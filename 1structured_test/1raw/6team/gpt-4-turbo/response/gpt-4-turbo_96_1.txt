To determine which team counted more days where a man's height exceeded 183 cm, we need to consider the probability distribution of heights in the population and how each team's sampling method affects their counts.

Given that the average height is 178 cm and there's an equal number of men taller and shorter than this average, this suggests a symmetric distribution around 178 cm, such as a normal distribution. We will make assumptions about how the height distribution might look above 183 cm.

For Team 1, each day they survey three men and then count days when the middle-ranked man in terms of height is over 183 cm. This means the second tallest needs to be above 183 cm. Thus, on any given day for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men surveyed need to exceed this height. 

For Team 2, they survey one man each day, and they simply count how many individuals exceed 183 cm. This is a more straightforward scenario where each selection goes directly towards the count without depending on the heights of other surveyed individuals.

We can estimate probabilities:
Assuming a normal distribution and average height of 178 cm, let's (arbitrarily, for example purposes) assume a standard deviation around 10 cm. The height of 183 cm would correspond approximately to a z-score of \(\frac{183-178}{10} = 0.5\). The probability of a man being taller than this in a normal distribution is roughly \(1 - \Phi(0.5)\), where \(\Phi\) is the cumulative distribution function for a normal distribution. This probability is approximately \(30%\).

For Team 1, the probability that two or three men out of three are taller than 183 cm involves some combinatorics and binomial probability calculations. The chance that at least two men exceed this height can be calculated based on the sum of the probabilities of exactly two and exactly three being taller:
- Probability exactly two men are taller: \({3 \choose 2}(0.3)^2(0.7) ≈ 0.189\),
- Probability exactly three men are taller: \((0.3)^3 ≈ 0.027\).
Together: \(0.189 + 0.027 = 0.216\).

For Team 2, the count would simply follow the individual man probability of 0.3 or 30%, which is higher than 21.6% for the middle man of Team 1's survey.

Consequently, it appears more likely for Team 2 to count a higher number of days with men taller than 183 cm, because each sampled individual directly impacts the count, unlike Team 1, which requires a higher condition that at least two of three men meet the criterion.
