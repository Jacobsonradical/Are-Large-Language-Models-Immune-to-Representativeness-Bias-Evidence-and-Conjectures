{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning for this choice:

- Since the average height is 178 cm, and heights are symmetrically distributed around this average, those taller than 183 cm represent a segment beyond one standard deviation above the mean, assuming a normal distribution.

- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man and counts the days where the height was over 183 cm. This directly measures the proportion of the population taller than 183 cm every day.

- Team 1, however, surveys three men each day and only counts the middle value. This means the middle height falls above 183 cm only if at least two out of the three surveyed men are taller than 183 cm. The probability of this (considering symmetry and distribution) is lower compared to just finding one man above 183 cm from a daily random sample.

- Therefore, Team 2's method of sampling directly tracks with the underlying proportion of men taller than 183 cm in the population, while Team 1â€™s method filters through an additional conditional layer (needing at least two men out of three surveyed to be above 183 cm), effectively lowering the frequency of counts above this height threshold.

Thus, it's more likely that Team 2 would have observed a larger number of days where the surveyed man's height exceeded 183 cm compared to Team 1.
