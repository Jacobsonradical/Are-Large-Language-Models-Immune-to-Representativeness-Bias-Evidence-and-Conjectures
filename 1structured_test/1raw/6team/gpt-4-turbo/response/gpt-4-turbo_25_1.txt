To answer this question, we must consider how the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm affects the results from each team's survey method.

1. **Team 1's Approach**: They survey three men and count the number of days the middle-ranked man is over 183 cm. The middle height is above 183 cm only if at least two out of three surveyed men are taller than 183 cm.

2. **Team 2's Approach**: They survey one man each day and count the number of days this single man is taller than 183 cm.

From the scenario described:
- We know that the average height is 178 cm, and by implication of the symmetric distribution around the mean, the number of men taller than 178 cm equals the number of men shorter than this height. 
- However, the distribution between 178 cm and 183+ cm wasn't explicitly specified. Given the average height is 178 cm and assuming a normal height distribution, it's likely a minority of the population is over 183 cm.

This brings us to the core consideration:
- The probability of any single man being over 183 cm is less than 50%, but specific value depends largely on the actual height distribution.
- For Team 1, the middle height being over 183 cm requires at least two sampled heights to be over 183 cm, a less likely event compared to just one man (as in Team 2's survey) being over this height.

Based on this reasoning, it's more probable for Team 2 to have counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm because each day the event of finding a man taller than 183 cm is independently and singularly evaluated, rather than being dependent on the ranks of three different heights.

Therefore, the answer would be:

{team: 2}
