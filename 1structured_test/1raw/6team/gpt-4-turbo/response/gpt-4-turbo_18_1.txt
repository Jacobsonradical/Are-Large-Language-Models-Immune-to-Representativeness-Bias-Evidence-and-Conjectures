To solve this query, we need to consider the likelihood of observing men taller than 183 cm in each team's survey.

**Understanding the Teams' Survey Methods:**
- **Team 1:** Surveys 3 men each day and ranks them by height. We are interested in the days when the middle-ranked man is taller than 183 cm.
- **Team 2:** Surveys 1 man each day and notes if he is taller than 183 cm.

**Key Consideration - Distribution and Probability:**
- Since we know the average height of men is 178 cm, and the population height distribution around this average is presumably normal (given there's an equal number of men below and above this height), let's assume 183 cm is relatively high in this distribution (though exactly how high isn't specified).
- Since Team 2 is sampling just one person each day without any ranking, their results depend entirely on the proportion of the population taller than 183 cm.
- Conversely, for Team 1 to count a day, not only does there need to be at least one man above 183 cm among the three sampled, but this man must also be the middle-ranked of the three in height. This requires both the presence of relatively taller individuals and specific order conditions being met among the three.

**Estimating the Probability:**
- Probability \( P \) that a single randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm might be relatively low (this depends on the distribution's standard deviation, which is not given, but we know 183 cm is above average).
- For Team 2, each day's survey probability matches \( P \).
- For Team 1, we are looking at the probability that the middle height of three sampled falls above 183 cm. The only way this occurs is if at least two out of three sampled men are taller than 183 cm, or the tallest two are above 183, and the shortest is below but not the lowest below 183 cm.

Given the extra condition needed for Team 1's count (at least two men must be taller than 183 cm instead of just one, or the middle order must be met), it's less likely for their counts to be as high as for Team 2 where only one tall man is needed per sample. Therefore, in expectation, you'd anticipate Team 2 to have a higher count of survey days showing men taller than 183 cm because their requirement is simpler and statistically more probable on any given day.

**Conclusion:**
In probability terms, Team 2 should statistically encounter more men taller than 183 cm simply because they need only one such occurrence per sampling day, as opposed to specific ranking conditions.

**Hence, the answer is:**

{team: 2}
