To answer this question, we first need to conceptualize the probability that a man chosen at random from the population is taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and the height distribution is assumed to be symmetric around 178 cm (an equal number of men taller and shorter than the average), a height of 183 cm is above average. 

Let's consider the distribution of heights as normalized, and without specific data about standard deviation or further distribution details, we can conservatively estimate that those whose height exceeds 183 cm represent a smaller portion of the population since 183 cm is significantly above the mean (5 cm above 178 cm average).

**Team 1:** Each day, this team samples three men at random and ranks them by height. They count a day if the middle-ranked (second tallest) man is taller than 183 cm. Due to the setup, there are fewer likely scenarios where the second tallest man exceeds 183 cm unless all three sampled men are from the "taller half" of the height distribution. Even so, it is less likely that the second man (middle in ranking order) exceeds 183 cm because he could easily be shorter than the tallest man, who could potentially be the only one above 183 cm.

**Team 2:** This team counts days based only on whether the single man they randomly sample each day is taller than 183 cm. Given the assumption that fewer than half of the men are above 183 cm, their count directly ties to this probability.

While both probabilities are inevitably influenced by the estimated percentage of the population above 183 cm, Team 2 likely will have recorded more such days. Team 1 needs at least two of the three sampled men to fall into the relatively smaller segment of the population above 183 cm for their criteria (middle man taller than 183 cm) to be met, which statistically should occur less often than the simpler single sampling carried out by Team 2.

Thus, in terms of the likelihood of recording more days where the man(s) is/are taller than 183 cm:
- **Team 1:** Less likely due to needing two out of three men to likely be amongst the tallest.
- **Team 2:** More likely due to the greater simplicity and higher probability in their sampling method.

Based on this analysis:
