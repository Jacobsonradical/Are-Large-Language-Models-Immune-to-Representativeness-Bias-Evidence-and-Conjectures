{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the height of any other man. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will survey a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams, since the same percentage of men in the population are taller than 183 cm.

Specifically, since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and there are as many men with height above average as below average, we can calculate the proportion of men taller than 183 cm as follows:

* 50% of men have height above the average of 178 cm
* To have a height of more than 183 cm, a man would need to be more than 5 cm above the average
* Since height is a continuous variable, we can assume that 50% of the "above average" men (i.e. 25% of all men) have a height of more than 183 cm

Therefore, we would expect both teams to record a man taller than 183 cm on approximately 25% of the days they survey men. Any difference in the number of days recorded by the two teams is unlikely to be significant, since the surveys are being conducted randomly and independently. Specifically, the difference in the number of days recorded by the two teams is unlikely to exceed 5% of the total number of days surveyed.
