{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

We know that the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, this means that the median height of men in the population is also around 178 cm.

To find the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm, we can use the empirical rule, which states that in a normal distribution, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% falls within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.

Since the median height of 178 cm is two standard deviations below the height of 183 cm, we can estimate that about 13.5% of men in the population are taller than 183 cm (since 100% - 95% - 2.5% = 4.5%, and 4.5% / 2 = 2.25%, and 2.25% \* 2 = 4.5%, and 100% - 95% - 4.5% - 4.5% = 13.5%).

Therefore, we would expect both teams to record a similar number of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm. Specifically, we would expect Team 1 to record about 13.5% \* 365 = 48.43 days, and we would expect Team 2 to record about 13.5% \* 365 = 48.43 days.

Since these numbers are within 5% of each other, we can conclude that both teams are likely to record a similar number of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm.
