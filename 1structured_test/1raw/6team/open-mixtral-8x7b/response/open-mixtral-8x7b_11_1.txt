{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to significantly impact the overall count of days where the surveyed men's height is over 183 cm. Furthermore, the selection of men is random, so the distribution of heights should be similar for both teams. Therefore, we would expect the number of days where the surveyed men's height is over 183 cm to be similar for both teams, within 5% of each other.
