{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of a year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to significantly affect the overall count of days where the surveyed men's height is over 183 cm. While Team 1 is surveying more men per day, Team 2 is surveying men independently on each day, which also reduces the impact of any individual man's height on the overall count.

Given the large sample sizes and the randomness of the surveys, it's reasonable to assume that the counts from both teams will be close to each other, within 5% of each other. Therefore, I would answer "3" for team 3, indicating that I think they are about the same within 5% of each other.
