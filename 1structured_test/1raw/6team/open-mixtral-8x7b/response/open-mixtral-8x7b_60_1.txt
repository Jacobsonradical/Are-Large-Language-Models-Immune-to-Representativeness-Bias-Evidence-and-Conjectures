{team: 3}

Here's my reasoning:

First, let's consider Team 1, which surveys three men each day. For the height of the middle man to be more than 183 cm, at least two of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183 cm. The probability of this happening is relatively low, considering that only about 34.7% of men are taller than 183 cm (183 cm is the 63rd percentile for male height).

Now, let's consider Team 2, which surveys only one man each day. The probability of a single randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is 0.347, which is significantly higher than the probability of having two or more men taller than 183 cm in Team 1's sample.

While Team 1 may have more days where the middle man's height is over 183 cm than Team 2 has days where the selected man's height is over 183 cm, the difference is unlikely to be significant. This is because the probability of having two or more men taller than 183 cm in Team 1's sample is much lower than the probability of having at least one man taller than 183 cm in Team 2's sample.

Therefore, I believe that the number of days on which Team 1 and Team 2 record heights over 183 cm will be approximately the same, within a 5% margin of error.
