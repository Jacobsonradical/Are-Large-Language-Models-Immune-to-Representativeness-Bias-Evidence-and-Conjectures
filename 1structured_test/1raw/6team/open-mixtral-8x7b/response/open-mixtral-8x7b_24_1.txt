{team: 3}

Here's my reasoning:

First, let's consider Team 1, which surveys three men each day. The probability that the middle man in a group of three has a height greater than 183 cm can be calculated as follows:

1. We first find the probability that the first man is less than or equal to 183 cm and the second and third men are both greater than 183 cm. We can do this by calculating the probabilities for each man separately and then multiplying them together.

   P(1st man <= 183 cm, 2nd man > 183 cm, 3rd man > 183 cm)

   P(1st man <= 183 cm) * P(2nd man > 183 cm) * P(3rd man > 183 cm)

   Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men with height above average as below average, the probability of a man having a height less than or equal to 183 cm is the same as a man having a height greater than 183 cm, which is 0.5.

   So, P(1st man <= 183 cm) = 0.5, P(2nd man > 183 cm) = 0.5, and P(3rd man > 183 cm) = 0.5.

   Multiplying these probabilities together:

   P(1st man <= 183 cm, 2nd man > 183 cm, 3rd man > 183 cm) = 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.125.

2. Now, we need to account for all the other possible orders in which the middle man can have a height greater than 183 cm:

   - 1st man > 183 cm, 2nd man <= 183 cm, 3rd man > 183 cm
   - 1st man > 183 cm, 2nd man > 183 cm, 3rd man <= 183 cm
   - 1st man <= 183 cm, 2nd man > 183 cm, 3rd man > 183 cm (the original scenario we calculated)

   Each of these scenarios will have a probability of 0.125.

3. Summing up the probabilities of all these scenarios:

   P(middle man > 183 cm) = 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 = 0.5.

Now let's consider Team 2, which surveys only one man each day. The probability that the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm is simply the probability that a randomly chosen man from the population is taller than 183 cm, which is 0.5 (as calculated earlier).

Since both teams have the same probability of counting a day where the selected man (or middle man) is taller than 183 cm (0.5), we can expect them to have similar counts (within 5% of each other). Therefore, I believe {team: 3} is the most appropriate answer.
