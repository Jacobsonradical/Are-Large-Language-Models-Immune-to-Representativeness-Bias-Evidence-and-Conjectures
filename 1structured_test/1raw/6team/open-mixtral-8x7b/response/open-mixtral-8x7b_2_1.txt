{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of a year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall count of days where the surveyed men's height is above 183 cm.

While Team 1 is surveying more men per day, the fact that they are ranking the men by height and only counting the middle man's height on each day should balance out any potential advantage they might have from surveying more men.

On the other hand, Team 2 is surveying fewer men per day, but they are still getting a representative sample of the population over the course of a year.

Given the large sample size and the randomness of the survey selection, we would expect the number of days where the surveyed men's height is above 183 cm to be about the same for both teams, within a 5% margin of error.
