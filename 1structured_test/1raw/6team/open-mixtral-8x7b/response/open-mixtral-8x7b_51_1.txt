{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be similar for both teams. Specifically, since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men with height above average as below, we can estimate that about 50% of the male population is taller than 183 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height, so the probability that the middle man has a height greater than 183 cm is slightly less than 50% (specifically, it's the probability that two randomly chosen men have a height less than or equal to 183 cm, which is approximately 0.4219). Therefore, we would expect Team 1 to record slightly fewer than 183 days (50% of 365) with a middle man taller than 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys one man each day and records the number of days on which that man is taller than 183 cm. Therefore, we would expect Team 2 to record approximately 183 days (50% of 365) with a man taller than 183 cm.

While there is a slight difference in the expected number of days that each team records, this difference is quite small (less than 5%) and is likely due to random chance. Therefore, I believe that the two teams are about the same in terms of the number of days they record a man taller than 183 cm.
