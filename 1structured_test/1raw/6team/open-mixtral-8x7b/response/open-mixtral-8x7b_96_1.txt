{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm will be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

We know that the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and that there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average. This means that the distribution of heights is roughly symmetric around the mean. Therefore, we would expect that about half of the men in the population are taller than 178 cm, and about half are shorter.

Since the mean height is 178 cm, and the standard deviation of human height is around 7-8 cm, we can estimate that the height of 183 cm is about 1.5 standard deviations above the mean. According to the empirical rule, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, and about 95% falls within two standard deviations. Therefore, we would expect that about 16% of the population has a height greater than 183 cm (100% - 68% - (2 * 15.9%) = 15.7%).

Since both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm should be close to the true proportion of men in the population with a height greater than 183 cm. Therefore, we would expect both teams to record a similar number of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm.

To be more precise, we can calculate the expected number of days on which each team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm. For Team 1, they survey three men each day, so the expected number of days on which the middle man is taller than 183 cm is given by:

expected value = (number of days) x (probability of event on any given day)

In this case, the number of days is 365, and the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is approximately 16%/2 = 8%, since there is a 16% chance that any particular man is taller than 183 cm, and the middle man has a 50% chance of being above the median height. Therefore, the expected number of days on which Team 1 records the middle man being taller than 183 cm is:

expected value = 365 x 0.5 x 0.16 = 29.2

For Team 2, they survey one man each day, so the expected number of days on which the man they survey is taller than 183 cm is given by:

expected value = (number of days) x (probability of event on any given day)

In this case, the number of days is 365, and the probability of the man they survey being taller than 183 cm is approximately 16%, since there is a 16% chance that any particular man is taller than 183 cm. Therefore, the expected number of days on which Team 2 records the man they survey being taller than 183 cm is:

expected value = 365 x 0.16 = 58.4

Therefore, we would expect Team 2 to record about twice as many days on which the man they survey is taller than 183 cm, compared to Team 1. However, this difference is relatively small (less than 50%) and may be explained by random chance or measurement error. Therefore, I believe that the number of days on which each team records a man taller than 183 cm will be about the same (within 5% of each other).
