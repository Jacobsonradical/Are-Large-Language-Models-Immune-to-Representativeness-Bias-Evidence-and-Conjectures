{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of a year, and the height of any given individual will be equally likely to be above or below 183 cm. While Team 1 is looking at a larger sample each day (3 men instead of 1), the key factor here is the number of days that each team is surveying. Over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is surveying many more men than Team 1 (365 men vs. 1,095 men). 

Due to the large number of surveys conducted by both teams and the random nature of selecting individuals, we would expect both teams to be close in their counts of days where the surveyed men have a height greater than 183 cm. The difference in counts should be relatively small and within 5% of each other, especially considering the central tendency of the male height distribution and the fact that the number of men above and below the average is roughly equal.
