{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of a year, so the Law of Large Numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is greater than 183 cm should be approximately the same for both teams. This proportion can be estimated as the number of men whose height is greater than 183 cm divided by the total number of men in the population.

Let's assume that the total number of men in the population is N, and that half of them have a height greater than 178 cm (and hence less than 183 cm). Then the number of men with a height greater than 183 cm is also N/2. Therefore, the proportion of men whose height is greater than 183 cm is N/2 divided by N, which simplifies to 1/2.

Now, let's consider the number of surveys conducted by each team. Team 1 conducts 365 * 3 = 1095 surveys, while Team 2 conducts 365 surveys. The expected number of surveys in which the height of the man (or men) surveyed is greater than 183 cm is therefore 1095 * 1/2 = 547.5 for Team 1 and 365 * 1/2 = 182.5 for Team 2.

The difference between the expected number of surveys for Teams 1 and 2 is therefore 547.5 - 182.5 = 365, which is a substantial difference. However, the question asks whether the number of surveys in which the height of the man (or men) surveyed is greater than 183 cm is within 5% of each other.

The difference between the expected number of surveys for Teams 1 and 2 is 365, which is approximately 21.5% of the expected number of surveys for Team 2 (365 / 182.5 = 2.00). Therefore, the difference between the expected number of surveys for Teams 1 and 2 is not within 5% of each other, and we cannot say with certainty which team recorded more such days.

However, we can say that the difference between the expected number of surveys for Teams 1 and 2 is not very large, and that the Law of Large Numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is greater than 183 cm should be approximately the same for both teams. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the number of surveys in which the height of the man (or men) surveyed is greater than 183 cm is within 5% of each other, and we can answer "3" to the question.
