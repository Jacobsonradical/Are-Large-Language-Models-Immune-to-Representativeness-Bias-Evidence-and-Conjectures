{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of a year, so the Law of Large Numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be similar for both teams. 

For Team 1, they are surveying three men each day and recording the height of the middle man. However, the height of the middle man is not necessarily above 183 cm just because there are an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm. In fact, since the distribution of heights around the average is likely to be normal or approximately normal, it is more likely that the middle man's height will be closer to the average than above 183 cm.

Similarly, for Team 2, they are simply recording the height of one randomly selected man each day. Again, the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be similar to that of Team 1, but the actual number of days on which they record such a height may vary due to chance.

Therefore, while there may be some day-to-day variation in the number of days on which each team records a height above 183 cm, over the course of a year, the total number of such days should be approximately equal for both teams, within a margin of error of 5%.
