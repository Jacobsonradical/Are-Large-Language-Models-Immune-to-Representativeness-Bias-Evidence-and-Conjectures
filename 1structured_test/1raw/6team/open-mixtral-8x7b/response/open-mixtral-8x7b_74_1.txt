{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will record a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams, since the probability of any individual man being taller than 183 cm is relatively low (given that the average height is only 178 cm).

Specifically, if we assume that the heights of men in the population are normally distributed with a mean of 178 cm and a standard deviation of, say, 8 cm (this is a rough estimate based on the information provided), then the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.10 (i.e., 10%).

Over the course of a year, we would therefore expect both teams to record roughly the same number of days on which they survey a man taller than 183 cm. More precisely, the expected number of such days for Team 1 is (365 \* 0.10)^3 \approx 42.87, while the expected number of such days for Team 2 is 365 \* 0.10 \approx 36.50. The difference between these two numbers is only about 16%, which is well within the 5% threshold specified in the question.

Therefore, we can conclude that both teams are likely to have recorded roughly the same number of days on which they surveyed a man taller than 183 cm.
