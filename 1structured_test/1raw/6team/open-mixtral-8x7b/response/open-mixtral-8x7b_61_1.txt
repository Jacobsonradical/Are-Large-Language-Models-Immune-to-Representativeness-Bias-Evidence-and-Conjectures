{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will record a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average. This means that the median height of men in the population is also around 178 cm (since the average and median are close when the distribution is symmetric).

Therefore, the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm is roughly equal to the proportion of men whose height is more than 5 cm above the median. Since height is a continuous variable, we can assume that this proportion is roughly normally distributed.

Using the empirical rule, we can estimate that about 16% of the population has a height more than one standard deviation above the mean. Since the standard deviation of height in this population is likely to be around 8 cm (based on the average height of 178 cm and a normal distribution), this means that about 16% of the population has a height greater than 184 cm.

Therefore, the proportion of days on which either team will record a man taller than 183 cm is around 16%. Since both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, the law of large numbers suggests that the number of days on which either team records a man taller than 183 cm will be approximately equal to 16% of the total number of days.

Therefore, we can expect both teams to record roughly the same number of days on which they survey a man taller than 183 cm, and the difference between the two teams' counts is unlikely to be more than 5%.
