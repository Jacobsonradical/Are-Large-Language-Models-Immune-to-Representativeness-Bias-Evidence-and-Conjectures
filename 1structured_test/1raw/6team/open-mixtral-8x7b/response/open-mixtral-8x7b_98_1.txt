{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the height of any other man. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team records a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams.

To be more precise, we can calculate the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm. Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability that he is shorter than 173 cm (i.e., 183 cm minus the mean height of 178 cm).

Using the empirical rule, we know that about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, and about 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean. Since the standard deviation of a normal distribution is approximately 8 cm, we can assume that the probability of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm is less than 2.5% (i.e., 5% divided by 2, since the tails of the distribution are symmetric).

Therefore, we would expect both teams to record a man taller than 183 cm on only a small fraction of the days they survey men. Moreover, since the number of surveys is large for both teams, the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of days on which they record a man taller than 183 cm should converge to the true probability of such an event.

Specifically, for Team 1, we would expect them to survey 365 x 3 = 1095 men over the course of the year. Since the probability of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm is less than 2.5%, we would expect Team 1 to record a man taller than 183 cm on fewer than 1095 x 0.025 = 27.375 days.

Similarly, for Team 2, we would expect them to survey 365 x 1 = 365 men over the course of the year. Therefore, we would expect them to record a man taller than 183 cm on fewer than 365 x 0.025 = 9.125 days.

Therefore, both teams are expected to record a man taller than 183 cm on relatively few days, and the difference between the two teams is not likely to be large. Specifically, the difference between the number of days on which Team 1 records a man taller than 183 cm and the number of days on which Team 2 records a man taller than 183 cm is expected to be less than 27.375 - 9.125 = 18.25 days. This represents a difference of less than 17%, which is well within the 5% threshold specified in the question.

Therefore, we can conclude that both teams are likely to record a similar number of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm. Specifically, our answer is:
