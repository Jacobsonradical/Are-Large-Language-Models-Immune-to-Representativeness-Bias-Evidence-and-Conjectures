{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying men randomly, so the heights of the men they survey should be representative of the overall population of men. The average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average. Therefore, about half of the men in the population are taller than 178 cm, and about half are shorter than 178 cm.

In order to be taller than 183 cm, a man must be above the 97th percentile in height. This means that only about 3% of the population is taller than 183 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day, so the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm on any given day is quite low. In fact, the probability that all three men are shorter than 183 cm is:

(0.97)^3 = 0.912

This means that the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm on any given day is:

1 - 0.912 = 0.088

Over the course of 365 days, we would expect Team 1 to have about 32 days (0.088 \* 365) where the middle man is taller than 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys only one man each day, so the probability that the man they survey is taller than 183 cm on any given day is also 0.03. Over the course of 365 days, we would expect Team 2 to have about 11 days (0.03 \* 365) where the man they survey is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, we would expect Team 1 to have about 32 days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm, and Team 2 to have about 11 days where the man they survey is taller than 183 cm. This means that Team 1 is expected to have about 21 more days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm than Team 2. However, this difference is only about 6% of the total number of days (365), which is within the 5% margin of error that you specified. Therefore, I believe that the two teams are about the same in terms of the number of days where they survey a man taller than 183 cm.
