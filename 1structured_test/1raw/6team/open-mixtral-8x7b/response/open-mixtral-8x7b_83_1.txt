{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is not dependent on the heights of the men surveyed on other days. Therefore, the number of days on which the surveyed men's heights exceed 183 cm should be roughly similar for both teams, within a small margin of error.

To be more precise, let's calculate the expected number of days for each team where the surveyed men's heights exceed 183 cm.

First, let's consider Team 1. Since they survey three men each day and there are as many men above the average height as below it, we can expect the middle man's height to be above the average height (178 cm) on about 50% of the days. However, since we're interested in heights above 183 cm, we need to calculate the probability of a man's height being in this range. Assuming a normal distribution for heights, we can estimate that about 2.5% of the population has a height above 183 cm. So, the probability of the middle man's height being above 183 cm is (0.5)*(0.025) = 0.0125 or 1.25%.

Therefore, we can expect Team 1 to have about 365 \* 1.25% = 4.575 ≈ 5 days with a middle man's height above 183 cm.

Next, let's consider Team 2. Since they survey only one man each day, the probability of the surveyed man's height being above 183 cm is the same as before: 2.5%. Therefore, we can expect Team 2 to have about 365 \* 2.5% = 9.125 ≈ 9 days with a surveyed man's height above 183 cm.

The difference between the expected number of days for Teams 1 and 2 is about 4 days. Given that both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, the differences in the number of days with a surveyed man's height above 183 cm should be small, and well within the 5% margin of error. Therefore, we can expect the number of such days to be about the same for both teams.
