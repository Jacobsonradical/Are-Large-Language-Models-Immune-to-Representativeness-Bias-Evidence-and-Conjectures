{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be similar for both teams. Specifically, since the average height is 178 cm and the heights are symmetrically distributed around the mean, we would expect about 2.5% of men to be taller than 183 cm (since 183 cm is about 2.5 standard deviations above the mean).

Now, let's compare the survey methods of the two teams. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height, while Team 2 surveys only one man each day. It seems intuitive that Team 1's method of surveying three men and ranking them by height might introduce some variability in the number of days they record a man taller than 183 cm, since they are more likely to have a "tall" man in their sample on some days and not on others. However, this variability should be relatively small, especially when averaged over a large number of days.

To quantify this intuition, we can calculate the expected number of days that each team will record a man taller than 183 cm. For Team 1, we can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of observing at least one man taller than 183 cm in a sample of three men. Specifically, the probability of observing at least one man taller than 183 cm is:

P(at least one man taller than 183 cm) = 1 - P(none of the men are taller than 183 cm)

Using the binomial distribution, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(none of the men are taller than 183 cm) = (1 - 0.025)^3 ≈ 0.9506

Therefore, the probability of observing at least one man taller than 183 cm is:

P(at least one man taller than 183 cm) = 1 - 0.9506 ≈ 0.0494

This means that on any given day, Team 1 has about a 4.94% chance of observing at least one man taller than 183 cm. Over the course of a year, this means that Team 1 would expect to observe a man taller than 183 cm on:

365 days/year × 0.0494 ≈ 18 days/year

For Team 2, the calculation is much simpler. Since they are surveying only one man each day, the probability of observing a man taller than 183 cm is simply the same as the overall proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 would expect to observe a man taller than 183 cm on:

365 days/year × 0.025 ≈ 9.125 days/year

Comparing these two numbers, we see that Team 1 is expected to observe a man taller than 183 cm on approximately twice as many days as Team 2. However, this difference is relatively small in absolute terms (about 9 days per year) and represents only about 4.8% of the total number of days in the year. Therefore, I believe that the two teams are likely to be about the same in terms of the number of days they observe a man taller than 183 cm, within a margin of error of about 5%.

Therefore, my answer is:
