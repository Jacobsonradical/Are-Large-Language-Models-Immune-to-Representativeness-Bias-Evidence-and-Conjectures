{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will survey a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm (which is less than the average height of 178 cm, but we don't know the exact proportion).

Team 1 surveys three men per day, and on average, we would expect that the middle man's height will be greater than 183 cm on a proportion of days equal to the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm. Team 2 surveys one man per day, so the proportion of days on which the man they survey is taller than 183 cm will also be equal to the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm.

Since both teams are looking for the same proportion of men, and they are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, we would expect the number of days on which they record a man taller than 183 cm to be about the same (within 5% of each other).
