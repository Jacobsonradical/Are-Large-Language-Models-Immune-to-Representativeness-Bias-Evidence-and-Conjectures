{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team records a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average. This means that about half of the men in the population are taller than 178 cm and about half are shorter. Since 183 cm is 5 cm above the average, we would expect that somewhat less than half of the men are taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, both teams are likely to record a man taller than 183 cm on somewhat less than half of the days, and the number of such days recorded by each team should be approximately equal, within a few percentage points.
