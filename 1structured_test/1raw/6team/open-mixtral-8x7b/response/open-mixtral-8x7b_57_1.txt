{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the final count. While Team 1 is surveying more men each day, this difference is unlikely to result in a significant difference in the final count, especially when considering the large number of days in the survey period. Therefore, we can expect the number of days on which the surveyed men have a height greater than 183 cm to be similar for both teams, within 5% of each other.
