{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will survey a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams.

Let's calculate the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm for each team. We'll assume that the heights of men in the population are normally distributed with a mean of 178 cm and a standard deviation of, say, 8 cm (the exact value is not important as long as it's reasonable).

For Team 1, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm on any given day is the probability that a randomly selected man from the population is taller than 183 cm. Using the normal distribution function, we can calculate this probability to be approximately 0.067, or 6.7%.

For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm on any given day is also the probability that a randomly selected man from the population is taller than 183 cm, which is the same as for Team 1 (approximately 6.7%).

Now, let's compare the number of surveys each team conducts in a year. Team 1 surveys three men per day for 365 days, for a total of 3 x 365 = 1095 surveys. Team 2 surveys one man per day for 365 days, for a total of 1 x 365 = 365 surveys.

Since the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams, we would expect the number of such surveys to be proportional to the total number of surveys each team conducts. Specifically, we would expect Team 1 to survey approximately 1095 x 6.7% = 73 such men, and Team 2 to survey approximately 365 x 6.7% = 24 such men.

Therefore, we would expect the number of days on which each team surveys a man taller than 183 cm to be approximately the same, with Team 1 counting about 73 such days and Team 2 counting about 24 such days. This represents a difference of approximately 50 days, or about 13%, which is within the 5% margin of error requested in the question.

Therefore, we can conclude that both teams are likely to have counted about the same number of days on which they surveyed a man taller than 183 cm, within a margin of error of 5%. Our answer is thus:
