{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the sample averages should be close to the population average. The population average height is 178 cm, and only a small fraction of men are likely to be much taller than this.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height, so the middle man's height is likely to be very close to the average height of the three men. Since the average height is close to 178 cm, it is unlikely that the middle man's height will exceed 183 cm on many days.

Team 2 surveys only one man each day, so the height of the man they survey is more likely to deviate from the population average. However, since only a small fraction of men are much taller than 178 cm, it is still unlikely that Team 2 will record many more days where the man's height exceeds 183 cm than Team 1.

Therefore, I believe that the number of days where the middle man's height exceeds 183 cm for Team 1 and the number of days where the man's height exceeds 183 cm for Team 2 will be approximately equal, and certainly within 5% of each other.
