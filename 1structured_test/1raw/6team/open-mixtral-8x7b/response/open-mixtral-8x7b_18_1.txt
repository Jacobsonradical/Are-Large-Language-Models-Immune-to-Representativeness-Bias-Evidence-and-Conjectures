{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be similar for both teams. 

For Team 1, they are surveying three men each day and ranking them by height. In order for the middle man's height to be above 183 cm, at least two of the three men surveyed must have a height above 183 cm. The probability of this occurring is relatively low, as it requires surveying a disproportionately large number of men who are taller than average.

For Team 2, they are only surveying one man each day, so the probability of surveying a man who is taller than 183 cm is much higher. However, they are also surveying a smaller number of men overall, which could potentially lead to a lower total count of days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.

Given these considerations, it is likely that the total number of days where the surveyed men's height is above 183 cm is roughly similar for both teams, and should be within 5% of each other.
