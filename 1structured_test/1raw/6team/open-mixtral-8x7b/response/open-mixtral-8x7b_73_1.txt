{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any given man is unlikely to significantly affect the overall results. While Team 1 is surveying more men each day and may therefore have a slightly larger sample size, this difference is unlikely to result in a significant difference in the number of days where the surveyed men's heights exceed 183 cm. Additionally, because the number of men whose height is above and below the average is equal, it is unlikely that Team 1's practice of ranking the men by height would have a significant impact on the results. Therefore, I would expect the number of days where the surveyed men's heights exceed 183 cm to be similar for both teams, within 5% of each other.
