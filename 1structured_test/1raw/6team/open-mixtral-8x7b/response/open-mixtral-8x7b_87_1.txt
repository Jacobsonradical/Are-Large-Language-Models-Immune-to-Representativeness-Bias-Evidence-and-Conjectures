Here's my reasoning:

Let's assume there are 2N men in the population. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, this means that around N men have a height of more than 178 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm in one try: since there are N men with a height of more than 183 cm and a total of 2N men, the probability is N/(2N) = 0.5.

Team 1 surveys 3 men every day:

- The probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of selecting just one man taller than 183 cm. This is because when selecting 3 men, there is a higher chance of having at least one tall man among them.

- To estimate the difference, let's calculate the exact probability for Team 1. Using the binomial distribution, the probability of having exactly one man taller than 183 cm is C(3, 1) \* (0.5)^1 \* (0.5)^2 = 0.75, where C(3, 1) is the binomial coefficient for choosing 1 success out of 3 trials.

- Since Team 1 counts days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm, they will count days with exactly one man taller than 183 cm, and sometimes two or three men taller than 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys one man every day:

- The probability of selecting one man taller than 183 cm is 0.5.

Since the probability for Team 1 of counting a day with a man taller than 183 cm is 0.75, and for Team 2 it's 0.5, Team 1 is more likely to count more days with men taller than 183 cm. However, the difference is not very large, and it should be within 5% of each other.

Therefore, I would answer:
