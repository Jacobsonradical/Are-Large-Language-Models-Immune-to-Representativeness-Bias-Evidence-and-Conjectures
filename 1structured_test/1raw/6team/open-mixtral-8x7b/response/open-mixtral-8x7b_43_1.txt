{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the Law of Large Numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is over 183 cm should be about the same for both teams. 

For Team 1, they are surveying 3 men per day, and so the probability that the middle height is over 183 cm is higher than the probability that a single randomly chosen man is over 183 cm. However, this difference is unlikely to be large enough to offset the fact that Team 1 is only counting the days where the middle height is over 183 cm, while Team 2 is counting all days where any height is over 183 cm.

Therefore, we would expect both teams to count roughly the same number of days where the height is over 183 cm, within a margin of error of 5%.
