{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team records a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

To calculate this proportion, we can use the fact that the average height in the population is 178 cm. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, this means that the median height in the population is also 178 cm. Therefore, about half of the men in the population are taller than 178 cm, and about half are shorter.

To be taller than 183 cm, a man would need to be above the 90th percentile of heights in this population. Since the distribution of heights is likely to be roughly normal (or at least symmetric around the mean), we can estimate that about 10% of men in the population are taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, we would expect both teams to record a man taller than 183 cm on about 10% of the days they survey men. Specifically, we would expect Team 1 to record such a man on 0.10 * 365 = 36.5 days, and we would expect Team 2 to record such a man on 0.10 * 365 = 36.5 days as well.

Since these numbers are so close, we can conclude that the two teams are likely to have recorded roughly the same number of days on which they surveyed a man taller than 183 cm. Specifically, the difference between the two teams' counts is expected to be less than 5%, so the answer is:
