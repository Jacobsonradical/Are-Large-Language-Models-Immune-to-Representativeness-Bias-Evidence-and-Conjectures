{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to significantly affect the overall count of days where the surveyed men's height is over 183 cm. This is especially true since the height of the "middle man" in Team 1's surveys is not guaranteed to be above 183 cm, even if both other men are taller than him.

Additionally, the fact that there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average suggests that the distribution of heights around the average of 178 cm is relatively symmetrical. This further reduces the likelihood of a significant difference in the counts recorded by the two teams.

Therefore, we can expect the number of days on which the surveyed men's height is over 183 cm to be about the same for both teams, within a 5% margin of error.
