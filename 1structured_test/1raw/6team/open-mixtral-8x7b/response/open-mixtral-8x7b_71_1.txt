{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is likely to be independent of the height of any other man. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team observes a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly similar for both teams.

To be more precise, let's assume that the heights of men in the population are normally distributed with a mean of 178 cm and a standard deviation of, say, 10 cm (this is just an assumption, but it's reasonable given the information provided). Then, the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm is:

P(height > 183 cm) = 1 - P(height <= 183 cm) = 1 - P(Z <= (183 - 178)/10) = 1 - P(Z <= 0.5)

where Z is a standard normal random variable. According to a standard normal table, P(Z <= 0.5) is approximately 0.6915, so P(height > 183 cm) is approximately 1 - 0.6915 = 0.3085, or about 30.85%.

Therefore, we would expect both teams to observe a man taller than 183 cm on approximately 30.85% of the days they survey men. The difference between the number of such days observed by the two teams is likely to be small, and within 5% of each other.
