{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to significantly impact the overall count of days where the surveyed man's height is over 183 cm. While Team 1 surveys more men each day, they also have more variance in their daily counts due to the ranking of the three men's heights. However, this increased variance should balance out over the long run of 365 days, and both teams should record similar counts of days where the surveyed men's heights exceed 183 cm (within 5% of each other).
