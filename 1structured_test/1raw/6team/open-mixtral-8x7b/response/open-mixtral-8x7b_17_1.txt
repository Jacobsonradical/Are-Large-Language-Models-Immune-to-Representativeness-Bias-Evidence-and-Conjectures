{team: 3}

Here's my explanation:

First, let's consider the height distribution of men in the population. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the distribution of heights on either side of the average (178 cm) should be roughly symmetrical.

Now, let's analyze the data collection process for both teams:

1. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. The probability of the middle man having a height greater than 183 cm can be calculated as follows:
   a. The tallest man has a height greater than 183 cm with a probability of (183 - 178)/(total height range), which is a relatively small probability.
   b. Even if the tallest man has a height less than 183 cm, the middle man can still have a height greater than 183 cm, but this probability is also small.
   c. Due to the roughly symmetrical distribution of heights around the average, the overall probability of the middle man having a height greater than 183 cm is low.

2. Team 2 surveys only one man each day, and the probability of that man having a height greater than 183 cm is simply (183 - 178)/(total height range). This probability is relatively low and constant for each day.

Given the low probability of either team recording a man taller than 183 cm, and the fact that Team 1 surveys three men each day with a lower overall probability of observing a man taller than 183 cm, both teams should be counting roughly the same number of days with a man taller than 183 cm. The difference is expected to be within 5% of each other, as the number of observations for Team 1 is three times that of Team 2.
