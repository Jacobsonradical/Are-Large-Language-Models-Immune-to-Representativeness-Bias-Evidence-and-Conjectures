{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams, assuming that the teams are surveying men uniformly at random from the population.

Team 1 surveys three men each day, so the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability that a single randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm. However, this difference is likely to be small and may be offset by the fact that Team 1 is surveying more men overall.

Specifically, let p be the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm. Then the probability that the middle man in a group of three is taller than 183 cm is:

P(middle man > 183 cm) = 3p(1-p)^2 + p^3

Expanding this expression and simplifying, we get:

P(middle man > 183 cm) = 3p - 5p^2 + 2p^3

Assuming that p is around 0.5 (i.e., that the probability of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm is roughly the same as the probability of him being shorter than 183 cm), we can estimate this probability as:

P(middle man > 183 cm) ≈ 3(0.5) - 5(0.5)^2 + 2(0.5)^3 ≈ 0.4375

This is slightly higher than the probability of a single randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm, but not by much. Moreover, Team 1 is surveying a much larger number of men overall, which should help to balance out this difference.

Specifically, over the course of the year, Team 1 will survey:

365 × 3 = 1095

men, while Team 2 will survey:

365 × 1 = 365

men. Therefore, even if the probability of Team 1 encountering a man taller than 183 cm is slightly higher on any given day, the fact that they are surveying more men overall means that the total number of days on which they encounter such men is likely to be very close to the total number of days on which Team 2 encounters such men.

Therefore, I would expect the two teams to have recorded very similar numbers of days on which they encountered men taller than 183 cm, and certainly within 5% of each other.
