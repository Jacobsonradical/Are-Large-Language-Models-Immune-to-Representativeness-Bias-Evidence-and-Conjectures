{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the sample averages should be close to the population average. The average height in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men above that as below, so about half the men are taller than 178 cm and half are shorter. 

For Team 1, they are surveying 3 men each day and ranking them by height. On any given day, there is a small chance that the middle man is taller than 183 cm (since only about 1/4 of the population is taller than this). However, since Team 1 is surveying 3 men each day for 365 days, the total number of days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm will be relatively large, but still less than 1/2 of the total number of days (since only about 1/4 of the men are taller than 183 cm).

For Team 2, they are surveying 1 man each day and simply counting the number of days where the man is taller than 183 cm. Again, since only about 1/4 of the population is taller than this, we would expect Team 2 to count about 1/4 of the total number of days (i.e., 91.25 days) where the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, both teams are likely to count a significant number of days where the men they survey are taller than 183 cm, but Team 1 is likely to count more such days than Team 2 (although not by a huge margin). Specifically, I would expect Team 1 to count around 130-135 days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm, while Team 2 would count around 91-92 days where the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm. This is a difference of around 40-45 days, or about 11-12%, which is slightly more than the 5% threshold given in the question. However, given the inherent variability in random sampling, it is possible that the two teams could count roughly the same number of days where the men they survey are taller than 183 cm (i.e., within 5% of each other). Therefore, I would answer "3" to indicate that the two teams are about the same (within 5% of each other).
