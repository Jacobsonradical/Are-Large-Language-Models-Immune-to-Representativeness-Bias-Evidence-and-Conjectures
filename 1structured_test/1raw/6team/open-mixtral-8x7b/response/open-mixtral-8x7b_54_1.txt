{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the height of any other man. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team records a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average. This means that about half of the men in the population are taller than 178 cm and about half are shorter. Since 183 cm is 5 cm above the average, it is likely that only a small fraction of men in the population are taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, both teams are likely to record a man taller than 183 cm on only a small fraction of the days they survey men. Furthermore, because the number of surveys each team conducts is large (Team 1 surveys 3 men per day for 365 days, and Team 2 surveys 1 man per day for 365 days), the Law of Large Numbers suggests that the proportion of days on which each team records a man taller than 183 cm should be close to the true population proportion, even if there is some variability from day to day.

Therefore, we would expect both teams to record a man taller than 183 cm on a similar proportion of days, and the difference between the two teams should be small (within 5% of each other).
