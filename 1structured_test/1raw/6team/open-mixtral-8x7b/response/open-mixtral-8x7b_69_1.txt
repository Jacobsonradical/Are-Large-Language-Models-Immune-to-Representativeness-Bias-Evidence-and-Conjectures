{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall count. While Team 1 is surveying more men each day, the fact that they are ranking them by height and only counting the middle man who is taller than 183 cm may balance out the larger sample size. Team 2 is surveying fewer men each day, but they are counting any man who is taller than 183 cm, which may also balance out the smaller sample size.

Therefore, it is likely that the number of days on which either team counts a man taller than 183 cm is about the same (within 5% of each other).
