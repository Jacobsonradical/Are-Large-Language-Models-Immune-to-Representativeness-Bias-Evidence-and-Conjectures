{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall count of days where the surveyed men's height is above 183 cm. Therefore, we can treat the number of surveys conducted by each team as a sampling process and compare the two processes to see which one is more likely to result in a similar number of days where the surveyed men's height is above 183 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. The probability that the middle man's height is above 183 cm is the probability that two randomly chosen men have heights below 183 cm and one man has a height above 183 cm. This probability can be calculated as follows:

P(middle man's height > 183 cm) = P(1st man's height < 183 cm) \* P(2nd man's height < 183 cm) \* P(3rd man's height > 183 cm) + P(1st man's height < 183 cm) \* P(2nd man's height > 183 cm) \* P(3rd man's height < 183 cm) + P(1st man's height > 183 cm) \* P(2nd man's height < 183 cm) \* P(3rd man's height < 183 cm)

Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, we can assume that the probability of a randomly chosen man having a height below 183 cm is higher than the probability of having a height above 183 cm. Let's assume that P(height < 183 cm) = 0.7 and P(height > 183 cm) = 0.3.

Then, the probability that the middle man's height is above 183 cm is:

P(middle man's height > 183 cm) = 0.7 \* 0.7 \* 0.3 + 0.7 \* 0.3 \* 0.7 + 0.3 \* 0.7 \* 0.7 = 0.3087

Therefore, on average, we would expect Team 1 to count about 30.87 days where the middle man's height is above 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys only one man each day, and the probability that his height is above 183 cm is the same as the probability that a randomly chosen man's height is above 183 cm, which we assumed to be 0.3. Therefore, on average, we would expect Team 2 to count about 30.42 days where the surveyed man's height is above 183 cm (since there are 365 days in a year).

The difference between the expected number of days counted by each team is only about 0.45 days, which is less than 5%. Therefore, we can expect the two teams to count a similar number of days where the surveyed men's height is above 183 cm, and answer 3 to the question.
