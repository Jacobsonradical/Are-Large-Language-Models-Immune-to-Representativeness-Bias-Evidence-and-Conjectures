{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall count of days where the surveyed man's height is over 183 cm. Furthermore, the fact that the population is split evenly between men who are taller and shorter than the average height of 178 cm suggests that the probability of selecting a man who is taller than 183 cm is relatively low.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the counts of such days recorded by both teams will be similar, and likely to be within 5% of each other.
