{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the Law of Large Numbers suggests that the sample surveys should be representative of the population. The population average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above this average as below it. 

For Team 1, they are surveying 3 men every day. The probability that the height of the middle man is above 183 cm can be calculated as follows:
1. The probability that the first man's height is less than or equal to 183 cm and the second man's height is greater than 183 cm is (178/183)^2 \* (5/183) ≈ 0.012
2. The probability that the first man's height is greater than 183 cm and the second man's height is less than or equal to 183 cm is (5/178)^2 \* (178/183) ≈ 0.012
3. The probability that the second man's height is greater than 183 cm and the third man's height is less than or equal to 183 cm is (5/183)^2 \* (178/183) ≈ 0.012
4. The total probability of the middle man's height being above 183 cm is 0.012 + 0.012 + 0.012 = 0.036.

For Team 2, they are surveying only 1 man each day. The probability that the man's height is above 183 cm is (5/178) ≈ 0.0282.

Over the course of 365 days, we would expect Team 1 to record approximately 365 \* 0.036 = 13.14 days where the middle man's height is above 183 cm. Similarly, we would expect Team 2 to record approximately 365 \* 0.0282 = 10.23 days where the man's height is above 183 cm.

The difference between the two expected values is 13.14 - 10.23 = 2.91, which is less than 5%. Therefore, we can conclude that both teams are likely to record a similar number of days where the height of the man surveyed is above 183 cm.
