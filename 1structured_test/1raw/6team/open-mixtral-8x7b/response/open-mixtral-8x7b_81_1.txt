{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the sample means for each team should be close to the population mean of 178 cm. The height threshold of 183 cm is 5 cm above the population mean, which is not a huge difference. 

For Team 1, they are surveying three men per day and ranking them by height. Since the distribution of heights is likely symmetric around the mean, there is a good chance that the middle man's height will be close to the population mean. Therefore, it is unlikely that Team 1 will count a disproportionately large number of days where the middle man's height is above 183 cm.

For Team 2, they are only surveying one man per day, so their sample mean will be more variable than Team 1's. However, since the population mean is close to 178 cm, it is still unlikely that Team 2 will count a disproportionately large number of days where the man's height is above 183 cm.

Overall, while there may be some difference in the number of days that each team counts, it is unlikely to be more than 5%. Therefore, I would expect the two teams to be about the same in terms of the number of days where they count a man's height as being above 183 cm.
