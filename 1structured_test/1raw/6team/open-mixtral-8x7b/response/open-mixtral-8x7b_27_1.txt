{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will survey a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams.

To be more precise, we can calculate the probability that a team surveys a man taller than 183 cm. For Team 1, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.015, since the probability that a single man is taller than 183 cm is 0.01 (since the average height is 178 cm and the distribution of heights is presumably symmetric), and the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm given that one of the three men is taller than 183 cm is approximately 2/3. Therefore, the expected number of days on which Team 1 will survey a man taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.015 \* 365 = 5.48.

For Team 2, the probability that the man they survey is taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.01, since the distribution of heights is presumably symmetric. Therefore, the expected number of days on which Team 2 will survey a man taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.01 \* 365 = 3.65.

The difference in the expected number of days is therefore approximately 1.83, or about 5% of the expected number of days for Team 1. Therefore, the two teams should count roughly the same number of days on which they survey a man taller than 183 cm, within a margin of error of 5%.
