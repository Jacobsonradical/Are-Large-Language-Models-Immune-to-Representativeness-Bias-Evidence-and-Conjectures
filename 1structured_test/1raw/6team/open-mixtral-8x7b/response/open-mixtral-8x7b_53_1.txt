{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the sample means for both teams should be close to the population mean of 178 cm. The height threshold of 183 cm is only 5 cm above the mean, which is not a particularly tall height for this population.

Team 1 surveys three men per day and ranks them by height. The middle man in this group will have a height that is close to the median of the three heights, which is in turn close to the mean height of the population. Therefore, the probability that the middle man's height exceeds 183 cm is relatively low.

Team 2 surveys only one man per day, so the height of the man they survey is more likely to deviate from the population mean. However, the distribution of heights around the mean is symmetric, so the number of days on which the man's height exceeds 183 cm should be approximately equal to the number of days on which his height is below 173 cm.

Given the symmetry of the distribution of heights around the mean, and the fact that the threshold of 183 cm is not very far from the mean, I would expect the number of days on which the middle man's height exceeds 183 cm (Team 1) to be roughly equal to the number of days on which the surveyed man's height exceeds 183 cm (Team 2). Therefore, I believe that the number of such days recorded by both teams will be about the same (within 5% of each other).
