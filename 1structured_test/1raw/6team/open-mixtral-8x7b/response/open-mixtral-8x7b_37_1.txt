{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will survey a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams.

To be more specific, we can calculate the probability that a team will survey a man taller than 183 cm on a given day. For Team 1, the middle man's height will be more than 183 cm if he is one of the tallest two out of the three men surveyed. The probability of this occurring is:

P(middle man > 183 cm) = 3 choose 2 \* (probability of being taller than 183 cm)^2 \* (probability of being shorter than or equal to 183 cm)

Using the given information, we know that the probability of being taller than 183 cm is 1 - (183/178)^2 ≈ 0.077, and the probability of being shorter than or equal to 183 cm is the opposite, 0.923. Plugging these in, we get:

P(middle man > 183 cm) ≈ 3 \* 0.077^2 \* 0.923 ≈ 0.0156

For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is simply the probability of any one individual man being taller than 183 cm, which is 0.077.

Over the course of 365 days, both teams will survey a large number of men, and the proportion of days on which they survey a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams. Specifically, for Team 1, we would expect around 365 \* 0.0156 ≈ 5.67 days on which the middle man's height is more than 183 cm, and for Team 2, we would expect around 365 \* 0.077 ≈ 28.05 days on which the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, both teams should record similar numbers of days on which they survey a man taller than 183 cm, with Team 2 recording slightly more due to their higher daily probability. However, the difference is not large, and both teams should be within 5% of each other.
