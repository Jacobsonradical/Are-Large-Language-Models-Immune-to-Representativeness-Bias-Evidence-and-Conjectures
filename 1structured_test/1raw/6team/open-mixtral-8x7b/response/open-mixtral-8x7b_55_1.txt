{team: 3}

Here's my reasoning:

First, let's consider Team 1, which surveys three men each day. The probability that the middle man has a height greater than 183 cm can be estimated by finding the percentage of men who are taller than 183 cm in the population. Let's assume that 30% of men are taller than 183 cm (this number is arbitrary but reasonable given the average height and normal height distribution).

To estimate the probability of having the middle height being taller than 183 cm, we can use the formula for the probability of the order of three numbers when drawing from a uniform distribution:

P(middle height > 183 cm) = 3 * (0.3)^2 * (1-0.3) + (0.3)^3 ≈ 0.1377

Now, let's consider Team 2, which surveys only one man each day. The probability that the selected man is taller than 183 cm is simply 0.3.

Since both teams collect data for 365 days, we can calculate the expected number of days with a man taller than 183 cm for each team:

Team 1: 365 * 0.1377 ≈ 50.2555
Team 2: 365 * 0.3 ≈ 109.5

The ratio of Team 1's expected count to Team 2's expected count is approximately 0.4616, which is less than 0.55 (a 5% difference). Therefore, I believe that the teams are about the same (within 5%) in counting such days.
