{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of a year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be accurately reflected in their surveys. The average height in the population is 178 cm, so about half of the men are taller than 178 cm and half are shorter. Since 183 cm is only 5 cm taller than the average, we would expect that roughly the same proportion of men are taller than 183 cm as are taller than the average height.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. On any given day, it is possible that none of the three men are taller than 183 cm, but it is also possible that all three are taller than 183 cm. However, since only about half of the men in the population are taller than 183 cm, it is unlikely that all three men selected by Team 1 on a given day will be taller than 183 cm. Therefore, we would expect Team 1 to count slightly fewer than half of the total number of days as days on which the middle man is taller than 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys only one man each day, so the number of days on which the man they survey is taller than 183 cm will be exactly proportional to the number of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm. Therefore, we would expect Team 2 to count roughly half of the total number of days as days on which the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Since both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of a year, the proportion of days on which they count a man taller than 183 cm should be very close to the true proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm. Therefore, we would expect the number of such days counted by both teams to be very close to each other, within 5% of each other.
