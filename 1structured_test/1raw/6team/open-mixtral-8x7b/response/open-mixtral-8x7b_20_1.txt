{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any given man is independent of the height of any other man. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm should be approximately the same for both teams.

To be more precise, we can calculate the probability that the height of a randomly selected man is greater than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below the average height, we can assume that the distribution of heights is symmetrical around the average. Therefore, the proportion of men whose height is more than 183 cm is equal to the proportion of men whose height is less than 173 cm (which is the same as the average height minus the difference between the average height and 183 cm).

The proportion of men whose height is less than 173 cm can be calculated as the area under a normal distribution curve with a mean of 178 and a standard deviation of (assuming a normal distribution for simplicity) from 173 to negative infinity. This area can be calculated using statistical software or a table of normal distribution probabilities and is approximately 0.1587, or about 15.87%.

Therefore, we would expect Team 1 to record about 15.87% of days with a middle man taller than 183 cm, and Team 2 to record about 15.87% of days with a man taller than 183 cm. The difference between these proportions is less than 5%, so the answer is 3: they are about the same (within 5% of each other).
