{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the height of any other man. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams.

To be more precise, we can calculate the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm. Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we know that the distribution of heights is symmetric around 178 cm. Therefore, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man being shorter than 173 cm (183 cm - 178 cm = 5 cm, which is the same as 178 cm - 173 cm).

The probability of a randomly selected man being shorter than 173 cm is:

P(height < 173 cm) = (173 cm - 0 cm) / (198 cm - 0 cm) = 173/198 ≈ 0.873

Since the distribution of heights is symmetric around 178 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is also approximately 0.873.

Therefore, the expected number of days on which Team 1 will encounter a man taller than 183 cm is:

Expected number of days = (365 days) x (0.873) x (1/3) ≈ 101.19 days

And the expected number of days on which Team 2 will encounter a man taller than 183 cm is:

Expected number of days = (365 days) x (0.873) ≈ 317.45 days

Therefore, both teams are expected to encounter men taller than 183 cm on more than 5% of the days in the survey period. However, because Team 1 is surveying three men each day and only counting the days on which the middle man is taller than 183 cm, they will encounter fewer such days than Team 2. Specifically, we would expect Team 1 to encounter a man taller than 183 cm on approximately 33.73 days (101.19 days / 3), which is less than 5% of the total number of days in the survey period.

Therefore, both teams are expected to count a similar number of days with men taller than 183 cm, but Team 1 will likely count fewer such days (within 5% of each other).
