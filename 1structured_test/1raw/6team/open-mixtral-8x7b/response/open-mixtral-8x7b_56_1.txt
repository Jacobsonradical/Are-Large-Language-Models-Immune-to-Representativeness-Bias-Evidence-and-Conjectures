{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team records a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average. This means that about half of the men in the population are taller than 178 cm and about half are shorter. Since 183 cm is 5 cm above the average, it's likely that a relatively small fraction of men in the population are taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, we would expect both teams to record a man taller than 183 cm on only a small fraction of the days they survey men. Specifically, we would expect Team 1 to record such a man on roughly (1/2)^3 = 1/8 of the days they survey, and we would expect Team 2 to record such a man on roughly 1/2 of the days they survey.

These expected values are quite close to each other, and in fact, they are within 5% of each other. Therefore, we would expect both teams to record a similar number of days on which they survey a man taller than 183 cm, and so I would answer "3" to indicate that they are about the same (within 5% of each other).
