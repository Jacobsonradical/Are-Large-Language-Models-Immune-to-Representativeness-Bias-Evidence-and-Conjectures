{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to significantly affect the overall count of days where the surveyed men's height is over 183 cm. Furthermore, the fact that there are as many men whose height is above average as there are below average suggests that the distribution of heights in the population is relatively symmetrical around the average of 178 cm.

Therefore, we would expect the number of days where the surveyed men's height is over 183 cm to be similar for both teams, with any differences likely to be within 5% of each other.
