{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man does not depend on which team surveyed him. Therefore, the distribution of heights among the men surveyed by Team 1 should be similar to the distribution of heights among the men surveyed by Team 2.

In particular, the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm should be the same for both teams. Let p be the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm. Then, on average, Team 1 will record p days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm, and Team 2 will record p days where the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

The difference in the number of days recorded by the two teams is therefore expected to be small, and should be within 5% of each other. Therefore, I would answer 3, indicating that I think the two teams recorded about the same number of days where the men surveyed were taller than 183 cm.
