{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be similar for both teams. This proportion can be estimated as the number of men whose height is above 183 cm divided by the total number of men surveyed.

For Team 1, the total number of men surveyed is 365 x 3 = 1095. If we assume that the distribution of heights in the population is roughly normal (which is a reasonable assumption given the large sample size), then the number of days on which the middle man has a height above 183 cm should be approximately equal to the number of days on which the middle man has a height below 163 cm. The total number of men whose height is below 163 cm is also roughly equal to the total number of men whose height is above 183 cm, so the number of days on which the middle man has a height above 183 cm should be around 1/4 of the total number of survey days, or about 91 days.

For Team 2, the total number of men surveyed is 365. Again, assuming a normal distribution of heights, the number of days on which the surveyed man has a height above 183 cm should be roughly equal to the number of days on which the surveyed man has a height below 163 cm. Since the number of men with a height below 163 cm is roughly equal to the number of men with a height above 183 cm, we can estimate the number of days on which the surveyed man has a height above 183 cm by taking the product of the proportion of men with a height above 183 cm and the total number of survey days. This gives us an estimate of 365 x (number of men with a height above 183 cm / total population) days.

Since the number of men with a height above 183 cm is roughly equal to the number of men with a height below 163 cm, and the number of men with a height below 163 cm is roughly equal to the number of men with a height above 178 cm (the average height), we can estimate the number of men with a height above 183 cm as being around 1/4 of the total population. This gives us an estimate of 365 x (1/4) = 91.25 days.

Therefore, both teams should have counted around the same number of days (within 5% of each other) on which the height of the man or men surveyed was taller than 183 cm.
