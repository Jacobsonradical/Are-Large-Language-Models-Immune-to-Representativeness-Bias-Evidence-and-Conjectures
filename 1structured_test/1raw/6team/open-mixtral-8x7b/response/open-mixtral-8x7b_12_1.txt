{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any given individual does not depend on whether they are surveyed by Team 1 or Team 2. Therefore, the distribution of heights among the men surveyed by each team should be similar.

For Team 1, the probability that the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm is relatively low, since the average height is only 178 cm. In order for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, both of the other two men in the group must be shorter than 183 cm as well. The probability of this occurring can be approximated as follows:

P(middle man > 183 cm) = P(1st man < 183 cm) \* P(2nd man < 183 cm) \* P(3rd man > 183 cm) + P(1st man < 183 cm) \* P(2nd man > 183 cm) \* P(3rd man < 183 cm) + P(1st man > 183 cm) \* P(2nd man < 183 cm) \* P(3rd man < 183 cm)

Using the fact that the probability of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.078 (i.e., 7.8%), we can calculate the above probability as follows:

P(middle man > 183 cm) = (0.922)^2 \* 0.078 + 2 \* 0.922 \* 0.078 \* (1 - 0.078) â‰ˆ 0.128

Therefore, we would expect Team 1 to record approximately 12.8% of days with a middle man taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is simply the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm, which we have already calculated as 0.078.

Therefore, we would expect Team 2 to record approximately 7.8% of days with a man taller than 183 cm.

Since the probability for Team 1 is about 1.65 times higher than that for Team 2, it is possible that Team 1 recorded more such days. However, the difference is not very large, and it is also possible that the two teams recorded roughly the same number of days (within 5% of each other). Therefore, I would lean towards answer 3, but there is some uncertainty in the prediction.
