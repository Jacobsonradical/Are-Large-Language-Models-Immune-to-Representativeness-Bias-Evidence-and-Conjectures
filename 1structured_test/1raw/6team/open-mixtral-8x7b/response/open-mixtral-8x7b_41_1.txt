{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any given individual has an equal chance of being above or below the average height of 178 cm. The key difference between the two teams is the number of men they survey each day: Team 1 surveys three men and ranks them by height, while Team 2 surveys only one man.

To determine which team is more likely to count a greater number of days on which the height of the man they survey is taller than 183 cm, we need to consider the probability that the middle-ranked man in Team 1's surveys is taller than 183 cm on any given day.

Let's assume that the heights of the men in the population are normally distributed around the average height of 178 cm. Then, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is relatively low, since 183 cm is more than 3.3 standard deviations above the mean. Specifically, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.0006, or 0.06% (using the empirical rule for normal distributions).

Now, let's consider Team 1's surveys. Since they survey three men each day and rank them by height, we can think of this as a selection process where the middle-ranked man is the one whose height is being compared to 183 cm. The probability that the middle-ranked man is taller than 183 cm is somewhat higher than the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm, since there is a greater chance that at least one of the three men surveyed is taller than average. However, this probability is still relatively low, and it is unlikely that Team 1 will count a large number of days where the middle-ranked man is taller than 183 cm.

On the other hand, Team 2 is only surveying one man each day, so the probability that the man they survey is taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm: approximately 0.0006, or 0.06%. Since Team 2 is surveying many more men over the course of the year than Team 1, it is likely that they will count a similar number of days where the man they survey is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, I believe that the number of days that Teams 1 and 2 count where the height of the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm will be approximately the same (within 5% of each other). This is because the probability that the middle-ranked man in Team 1's surveys is taller than 183 cm is only slightly higher than the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm, and Team 2 is surveying many more men over the course of the year.
