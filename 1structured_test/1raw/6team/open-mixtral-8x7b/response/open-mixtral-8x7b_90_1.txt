{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any given individual does not change over this time period. Therefore, the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be the same for both teams, assuming that their sampling methods are unbiased and representative of the population.

To be more precise, let's calculate the expected number of days on which each team will record a man taller than 183 cm. We know that the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and that there are as many men above this average as below it. Therefore, the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is:

(183 - 178) / (height of tallest man - height of shortest man)

We don't know the exact range of heights in the population, but let's assume for the sake of argument that the tallest man is 210 cm tall and the shortest man is 140 cm tall. Then the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is:

(183 - 178) / (210 - 140) = 5 / 70 = 1 / 14 ≈ 0.0714

Over the course of a year, Team 1 surveys 3 men per day for 365 days, for a total of 1095 men. We would expect approximately 1095 \* 0.0714 ≈ 78.35 men to be taller than 183 cm, which means that we would expect Team 1 to record a man taller than 183 cm on approximately 78.35 / 365 ≈ 0.215 days, or about 21.5% of the days.

Team 2 surveys 1 man per day for 365 days, for a total of 365 men. We would expect approximately 365 \* 0.0714 ≈ 26.05 men to be taller than 183 cm, which means that we would expect Team 2 to record a man taller than 183 cm on approximately 26.05 / 365 ≈ 0.0715 days, or about 7.15% of the days.

Therefore, we would expect Team 1 to record a man taller than 183 cm on approximately three times as many days as Team 2. However, this difference is still within 5% of each other, since 21.5% is about 16.35 percentage points higher than 7.15%. So, while Team 1 is likely to record more such days, the difference is not large enough to be statistically significant at a 5% level. Therefore, I would answer "3" for "about the same (within 5% of each other)".
