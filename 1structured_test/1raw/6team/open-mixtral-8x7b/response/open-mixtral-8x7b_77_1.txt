{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the final count. While Team 1 is surveying more men per day, and may therefore have a slightly larger sample size, this is unlikely to result in a significant difference in the final count, especially when considering the margin of error of 5%. Therefore, it is likely that the two teams recorded similar numbers of days on which they encountered men taller than 183 cm.
