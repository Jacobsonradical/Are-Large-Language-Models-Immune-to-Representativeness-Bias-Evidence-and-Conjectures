{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team records a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average. Therefore, about half of the men in the population are taller than 178 cm, and about half are shorter.

Since the height of a person is a continuous variable, we can assume that the distribution of heights in the population is roughly normal, with the average height being 178 cm. This means that the height of 183 cm is about 2.5 standard deviations above the mean. According to the empirical rule, about 99.6% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution. This means that only about 0.135% of the population is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, we would expect both teams to record a man taller than 183 cm on only a small fraction of the days they surveyed. Specifically, we would expect Team 1 to record such a man on approximately 0.135% \* 3 = 0.00405, or about 0.41 days, on average. Similarly, we would expect Team 2 to record such a man on approximately 0.135% \* 1 = 0.00135, or about 0.27 days, on average.

Therefore, both teams should record a man taller than 183 cm on roughly the same number of days, with Team 1 recording slightly more such days due to the larger number of men they survey each day. However, the difference is very small and is unlikely to be statistically significant. Specifically, the difference between 0.41 days and 0.27 days is only about 0.14 days, which is less than 5%. Therefore, I believe that the two teams should record roughly the same number of days with a man taller than 183 cm, within 5% of each other.

So, my answer is:
