{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the final count. While Team 1 is more likely to survey men who are taller than 183 cm on days when the middle-ranked man is tall, this is balanced out by days when the middle-ranked man is not tall. Similarly, Team 2 will survey some men who are taller than 183 cm and some who are not, with no bias towards either group.

Therefore, we would expect the number of days on which either team surveys a man taller than 183 cm to be approximately equal, within a margin of error of 5%.
