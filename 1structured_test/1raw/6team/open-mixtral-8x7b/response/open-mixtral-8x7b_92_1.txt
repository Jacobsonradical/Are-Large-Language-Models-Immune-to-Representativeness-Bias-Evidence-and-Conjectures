{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall count of days where the surveyed men's height is over 183 cm.

While Team 1 is surveying more men per day, which could potentially lead to a higher count, the fact that they are ranking the men by height suggests that there may be some overlap in the men they survey on different days. This means that the additional men surveyed by Team 1 may not necessarily result in a significantly higher count of days where the middle man's height is over 183 cm.

On the other hand, while Team 2 is surveying fewer men per day, they are still surveying a large number of men over the course of the year. The fact that they are simply counting the number of days where the surveyed man's height is over 183 cm suggests that they may be less likely to encounter overlap in the men they survey on different days.

Overall, while there may be some variation in the counts between the two teams, it is unlikely to be significant enough to favor one team over the other. Therefore, I would expect the two teams to be about the same (within 5%) in their counts of days where the surveyed men's height is over 183 cm.
