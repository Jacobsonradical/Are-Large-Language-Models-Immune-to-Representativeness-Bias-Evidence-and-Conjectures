{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall count of men whose height exceeds 183 cm. While Team 1 is surveying more men each day, the fact that they are ranking the men by height suggests that they are still only counting a single day if the middle man's height is above 183 cm.

Therefore, both teams are likely counting similar numbers of days where the men surveyed have a height above 183 cm. The difference in the number of men surveyed each day is not likely to be significant enough to result in a difference of more than 5% between the two teams' counts.
