{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of a year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be similar for both teams. 

For Team 1, they are surveying three men each day and ranking them by height. The middle man in this group will have a height that is closer to the average height of the population than the other two men. Therefore, the probability that the middle man's height is above 183 cm should be similar to the overall proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, they are only surveying one man each day, but the same principle applies. The probability that the man they survey is taller than 183 cm should be similar to the overall proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, we would expect both teams to record a similar number of days where the men they surveyed were taller than 183 cm. The difference in the number of days recorded by both teams should be within 5% of each other.
