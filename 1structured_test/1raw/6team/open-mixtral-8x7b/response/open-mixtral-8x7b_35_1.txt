{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the final count. While Team 1 is surveying more men each day, the fact that they are ranking them by height and only counting the middle man who is taller than 183 cm may balance out the increased sample size. Additionally, since only about half of the men in the population are taller than the average height of 178 cm, and only a fraction of those men are taller than 183 cm, the difference in the number of days that either team counts such men is unlikely to be significant. Therefore, I believe that the two teams are about the same (within 5%) in their final counts.
