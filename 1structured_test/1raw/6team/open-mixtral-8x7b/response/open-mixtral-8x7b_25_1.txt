{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the height of any other man. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will survey a man taller than 183 cm should be approximately equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

To estimate this proportion, we can use the fact that the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm. If there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, then about half of the men in the population are taller than the average height. Since the average height is 178 cm, this means that about half of the men in the population are taller than 178 cm.

Now, we need to find the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm. This is equal to the proportion of men whose height is more than 5 cm above the average height. Since the distribution of heights is likely to be roughly normal, we can estimate this proportion using the empirical rule. According to the empirical rule, about 34% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, and about 14% of the data falls more than one standard deviation from the mean.

If we assume that the standard deviation of height in this population is around 8 cm (which is a reasonable estimate based on data from other populations), then one standard deviation is equal to 8 cm. Therefore, 183 cm is about 1.125 standard deviations above the mean (since 5 cm is 0.625 standard deviations above the mean). Based on the empirical rule, about 14% of the data falls more than one standard deviation from the mean, but this includes data on both sides of the mean. Since we are only interested in data that falls more than one standard deviation above the mean, we need to divide this proportion by 2 to get an estimate of the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm. This gives us an estimated proportion of 7% (or 0.07).

Therefore, we would expect both teams to survey a man taller than 183 cm on about 7% of the days, or about 26 days out of 365. Since this is a relatively small proportion, the law of large numbers suggests that the number of days on which each team surveys a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly equal, and should be close to the expected value of 26 days. Therefore, I would expect the two teams to record similar numbers of such days, with a difference of no more than 5%.
