{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of a year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be similar for both teams. This proportion is likely to be relatively small, given that only around 16% of men in the population are taller than 183 cm (since the average height is 178 cm).

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height, so on days where the middle man's height is above 183 cm, it must be the case that at least two of the men surveyed are taller than 183 cm. On the other hand, on days where the middle man's height is below 183 cm, it could still be the case that one or more of the other two men surveyed are taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 1 is likely to count more days where at least one man is taller than 183 cm, compared to Team 2.

However, the difference in the number of days counted by each team is unlikely to be large. This is because the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm is relatively small, so the probability of any given man surveyed being taller than 183 cm is also small. Therefore, while Team 1 may count more days where at least one man is taller than 183 cm, the difference between the two teams is unlikely to exceed 5%.

In summary, both teams are likely to count a similar number of days where at least one man is taller than 183 cm, with any difference being unlikely to exceed 5%. Therefore, I would answer "3" for "about the same (within 5% of each other)".
