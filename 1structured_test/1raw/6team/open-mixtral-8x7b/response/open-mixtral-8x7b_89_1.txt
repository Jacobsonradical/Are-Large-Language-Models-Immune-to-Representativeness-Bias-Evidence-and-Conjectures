{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to significantly affect the overall count of days where the surveyed men's height is above 183 cm.

While Team 1 is surveying more men per day (3 vs 1), they are also ranking the men with respect to their height, which introduces some additional variability. However, this is unlikely to significantly impact the overall count, as the number of men surveyed per day is still relatively small compared to the population size.

Therefore, we would expect both teams to record similar counts of days where the surveyed men's height is above 183 cm, within 5% of each other.
