{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams, assuming they are surveying different men each day.

To be more specific, we can calculate the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm. Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, we can assume that the distribution of heights is symmetric around this mean. Therefore, the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm is the same as the proportion who are shorter than 173 cm (183 - 178 cm).

Assuming a normal distribution of heights, we can calculate the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm as follows:

p = P(height > 183 cm) = P(Z > (183 - 178)/(standard deviation))

where Z is a standard normal variable and the standard deviation is the standard deviation of heights in the population.

We don't have information about the standard deviation of heights in this population, but we can assume that it is around 8 cm (based on data for adult men in general). Plugging in this value, we get:

p = P(Z > (183 - 178)/8) = P(Z > 0.625) = 0.266

Therefore, on any given day, we would expect Team 1 to encounter a man taller than 183 cm with probability 0.266 x 3 = 0.798 (i.e., on average, about 1 out of every 4 days). Similarly, we would expect Team 2 to encounter such a man with probability 0.266 x 1 = 0.266 (i.e., on average, about 1 out of every 4 days).

Therefore, both teams should record roughly the same number of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm. To be more precise, the expected number of such days for Team 1 is 365 x 0.798 = 291.6, and for Team 2 it is 365 x 0.266 = 97.55. Therefore, the expected number of such days for Team 1 is about 3 times higher than for Team 2, but the actual number of such days will vary due to randomness. Based on the information given, I would expect the two teams to record numbers of such days that are within 5% of each other. Therefore, I would answer "3" to the question.
