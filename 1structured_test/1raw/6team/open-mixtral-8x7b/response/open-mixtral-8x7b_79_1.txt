{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man does not depend on which team is surveying him. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm should be the same for both teams.

To be more precise, let's assume that the distribution of heights in the population is roughly normal (which is a reasonable assumption for many biological traits like height). Then, we can calculate the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm as follows:

P(height > 183 cm) = 1 - P(height <= 183 cm)

Using a normal approximation, we can calculate this probability to be approximately 0.12 (or 12%).

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, we would expect Team 1 to record approximately 12% \* 365 = 43.8 days with a middle man taller than 183 cm, and we would expect Team 2 to record approximately 12% \* 365 = 43.8 days with a man taller than 183 cm.

Thus, the expected number of days recorded by both teams is very close to each other, and it is likely that the actual number of days recorded by both teams will be within 5% of each other. Therefore, I would answer "3" for "about the same (within 5% of each other)".
