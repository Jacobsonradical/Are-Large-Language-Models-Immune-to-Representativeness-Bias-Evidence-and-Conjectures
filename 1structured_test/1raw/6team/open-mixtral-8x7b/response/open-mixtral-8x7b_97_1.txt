{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

To calculate this proportion, we can use the fact that the average height of men in the population is 178 cm. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can divide the population into three equal groups: those with height less than 178 cm, those with height exactly equal to 178 cm, and those with height greater than 178 cm. The group of interest to us is the last one, which contains men who are taller than 183 cm as well as some who are between 178 cm and 183 cm.

To estimate the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm, we can assume that the distribution of heights around the average is roughly symmetric. This means that the group of men who are taller than 183 cm is roughly the same size as the group of men who are shorter than 163 cm (i.e., 178 cm - 15 cm, where 15 cm is half the difference between 183 cm and 178 cm). Since the average height is 178 cm, we can estimate that about 1/3 of the population is taller than 178 cm, and therefore about 1/6 of the population is taller than 183 cm.

Over the course of 365 days, both teams are surveying a large enough sample of the population that we would expect the proportion of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm to be close to the true proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm. Specifically, if we assume that the distribution of heights is roughly normal (which is a reasonable assumption given the large sample size), we can calculate the probability of observing a man taller than 183 cm using the standard normal distribution. This probability is approximately 0.067, or about 6.7%, which is close to the estimated proportion of 1/6.

Therefore, we would expect both teams to observe a man taller than 183 cm on roughly 6.7% of the days they survey. This means that the total number of days on which each team observes a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same, and any differences between the two teams' counts are likely to be due to random variation. Specifically, if we assume that the distribution of the number of days on which each team observes a man taller than 183 cm is roughly normal (which is a reasonable assumption given the large sample size), then the standard deviation of this distribution is approximately the square root of the product of the true proportion and the number of days surveyed. For Team 1, this is sqrt(0.067 \* 365) = 8.3, while for Team 2, it is sqrt(0.067 \* 365) = 8.3 as well. Therefore, the difference between the two teams' counts is likely to be less than 2 \* 8.3 = 16.6 days, which is well within the 5% margin of error.

Therefore, we can conclude that both teams are likely to have recorded roughly the same number of days on which they observed a man taller than 183 cm, and any differences between the two teams' counts are likely to be due to random variation. Our answer is therefore 3, indicating that the two teams are about the same (within 5% of each other).
