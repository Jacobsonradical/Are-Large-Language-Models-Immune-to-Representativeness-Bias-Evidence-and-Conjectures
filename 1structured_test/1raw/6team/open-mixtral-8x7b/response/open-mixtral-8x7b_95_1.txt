{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any given individual does not significantly change from day to day. Therefore, the proportion of men whose height exceeds 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams.

To be more precise, let's calculate the probability of a man's height exceeding 183 cm. Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the distribution of heights is symmetrical around the mean. Therefore, the median height is also around 178 cm.

The probability of a randomly selected man's height exceeding 183 cm is therefore the proportion of the population with heights greater than 183 cm, which is the same as the proportion with heights less than 173 cm (since the distribution is symmetrical around the mean). This proportion can be estimated as follows:

* The standard deviation of height in the population can be estimated as the difference between the mean and the median, divided by a factor of 2 (since the distribution is symmetrical around the mean). This gives us a standard deviation of (183 - 178) / 2 = 2.5 cm.
* The proportion of the population with heights less than 173 cm can be estimated as the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution with mean 178 cm and standard deviation 2.5 cm, evaluated at 173 cm. Using a normal distribution table or calculator, this comes out to be approximately 0.1587, or 15.87%.

Therefore, the expected number of days on which a team would survey a man with a height exceeding 183 cm is:

* Team 1: 365 days \* 0.1587 \* (1 - 0.1587)^2 \* 3 = 47.6 days (approximately)
* Team 2: 365 days \* 0.1587 \* (1 - 0.1587) = 47.6 days (approximately)

The fact that both teams are expected to record roughly the same number of days with men exceeding 183 cm, and that the variation in the number of recorded days is likely to be relatively small (due to the large sample size), suggests that the number of days recorded by both teams is likely to be within 5% of each other. Therefore, I would answer "3" to the question.
