{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the final count. Furthermore, the process of randomly selecting men to survey should ensure that the distribution of heights in the sample is representative of the population as a whole.

Given that the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, it is relatively uncommon for a man to be taller than 183 cm. In fact, we would expect only about 1 in 6 men to meet this criteria (since 183 - 178 = 5, which is approximately one standard deviation above the mean).

Therefore, both teams are likely to record a similar number of days on which the height of the man (or men) they survey is greater than 183 cm. Specifically, we would expect Team 1 to record approximately 1/6 \* 3 = 0.5 days per week on average, or roughly 26 days per year. Similarly, we would expect Team 2 to record approximately 1/6 \* 1 = 0.17 days per week on average, or roughly 8 days per year.

While there may be some variability in these counts due to chance, it is unlikely that either team will record significantly more or less than the expected number of days. Therefore, I would expect the two teams to be about the same (within 5% of each other) in terms of the number of days on which they record a man taller than 183 cm.
