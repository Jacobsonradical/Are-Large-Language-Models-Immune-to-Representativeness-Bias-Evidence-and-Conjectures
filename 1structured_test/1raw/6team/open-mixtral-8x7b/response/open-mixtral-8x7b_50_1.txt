{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the height of any other man. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team records a man taller than 183 cm should be approximately equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

To calculate this proportion, we can use the fact that the average height of men in the population is 178 cm. If there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, then the median height of men in the population is also 178 cm. This means that half of all men in the population are taller than 178 cm and half are shorter.

We are interested in the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm, which is 5 cm above the median height. Since height is a continuous variable, we can assume that the distribution of heights in the population is roughly normal. In a normal distribution, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% falls within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.

To estimate the standard deviation of height in this population, we can use the fact that about 68% of men are taller than 178 cm - 1 SD and shorter than 178 cm + 1 SD. Since we know that the median height is 178 cm, this means that 1 SD is approximately 5 cm.

Therefore, about 2.5% of men in the population are taller than 183 cm (which is 1.5 SDs above the median height). Over the course of 365 days, both teams should record a man taller than 183 cm on roughly 2.5% of days, or about 9 days. This represents a difference of less than 5% between the two teams, so we can conclude that they are about the same in terms of the number of days on which they record a man taller than 183 cm.
