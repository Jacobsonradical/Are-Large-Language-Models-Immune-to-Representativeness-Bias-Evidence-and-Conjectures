{team: 3}

Here's my reasoning:

First, let's consider Team 1, who surveys three men each day. For the height of the middle man to be more than 183 cm, at least two of the men surveyed must be taller than 183 cm (since the middle value in a set of three numbers is greater than or equal to the other two numbers).

The probability of selecting at least two men taller than 183 cm in a single day is quite low, given that only about 3.3% of the male population is taller than 183 cm (assuming a normal distribution of heights around 178 cm). The exact probability would depend on the specific distribution, but it would still be relatively low.

Now, let's consider Team 2, who surveys only one man each day. The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is 3.3%, but since they survey only one person each day, the probability of not encountering someone taller than 183 cm is much higher.

Since both teams are randomly selecting individuals from the same population, the difference in the number of days each team counts men taller than 183 cm should be relatively small. Although the probability for Team 1 to select two or more men taller than 183 cm is lower than Team 2 selecting at least one man taller than 183 cm, the difference in daily counts should not be substantial.

Therefore, I believe that the number of days each team counts men taller than 183 cm will be approximately the same (within 5% of each other).
