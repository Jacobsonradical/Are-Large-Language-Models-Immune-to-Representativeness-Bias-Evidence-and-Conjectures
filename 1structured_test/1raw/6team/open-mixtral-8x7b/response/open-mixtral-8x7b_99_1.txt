{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the height of any other man. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will record a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams.

To be more specific, we can calculate the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above the average height as below it, the probability that a man is taller than 183 cm is equal to the probability that a man is shorter than 178 cm.

The probability that a man is shorter than 178 cm is 0.5, since half of the men are below the average height. Therefore, the probability that a man is taller than 183 cm is also 0.5.

Over the course of 365 days, we would expect Team 1 to survey 1,095 men (3 men/day x 365 days/year). Therefore, the number of days on which Team 1 records a man taller than 183 cm would follow a binomial distribution with n = 1,095 and p = 0.5.

The expected number of such days is therefore np = 1,095 x 0.5 = 547.5. Since the number of days is a whole number, we would round this to 548 days.

Team 2, on the other hand, would survey 365 men over the course of the year. Therefore, the number of days on which Team 2 records a man taller than 183 cm would also follow a binomial distribution with n = 365 and p = 0.5.

The expected number of such days is therefore np = 365 x 0.5 = 182.5. Again, since the number of days is a whole number, we would round this to 183 days.

Therefore, we would expect Team 1 to record more days on which a man is taller than 183 cm than Team 2. However, the difference is relatively small - only about 365 - and represents a proportion of less than 5% of the number of days in the year. Therefore, I believe that the difference in the number of days recorded by the two teams is not statistically significant, and it is reasonable to say that the two teams recorded roughly the same number of days on which a man was taller than 183 cm (within 5% of each other).
