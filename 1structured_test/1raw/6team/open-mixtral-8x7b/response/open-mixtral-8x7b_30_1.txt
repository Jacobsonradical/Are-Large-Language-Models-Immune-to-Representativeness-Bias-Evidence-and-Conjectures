{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams.

To be more precise, we can calculate the probability that a team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm on a given day. Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the distribution of heights is symmetrical around the mean. Therefore, the proportion of men whose height is more than 183 cm is the same as the proportion of men whose height is less than 173 cm.

The probability that a team will encounter a man whose height is less than 173 cm is equal to the area under the normal curve to the left of 173 cm. This probability can be calculated using statistical software or a calculator with a built-in normal distribution function. For example, the probability that a man's height is less than 173 cm is approximately 0.123, which means that the probability that a man's height is more than 183 cm is also approximately 0.123.

Over the course of a year, both teams are surveying a large number of men, so we can use the Central Limit Theorem to assume that the distribution of the number of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm is approximately normal. The mean and standard deviation of this distribution can be calculated as follows:

* Mean: 365 \* 0.123 = 44.455 (for Team 1) and 365 \* 0.123 = 44.455 (for Team 2)
* Standard deviation: sqrt(365 \* 0.123 \* 0.877) = 5.045 (for Team 1) and sqrt(365 \* 0.123 \* 0.877) = 2.241 (for Team 2)

Note that the standard deviation for Team 1 is larger than for Team 2 because Team 1 is surveying more men per day. However, both distributions are approximately normal and have similar means, so we would expect the number of days on which each team encounters a man taller than 183 cm to be similar.

To be more precise, we can calculate the probability that the number of days on which Team 1 encounters a man taller than 183 cm is more than 5% higher than the number of days on which Team 2 encounters a man taller than 183 cm. This can be calculated as follows:

P(Team 1 > 1.05 \* Team 2) = P((Team 1 - Team 2) / sqrt(5.045^2 + 2.241^2) > (1.05 \* 44.455 - 44.455) / sqrt(5.045^2 + 2.241^2))

Using statistical software, we can calculate this probability to be approximately 0.16, which means that there is only a 16% chance that Team 1 will record more than 5% more days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm than Team 2. Therefore, we can conclude that the number of such days recorded by both teams is likely to be about the same (within 5% of each other).
