{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall count. While Team 1 is more likely to survey men who are taller than 183 cm on days when they survey three men whose heights cluster around the middle of the range, this effect is unlikely to be large enough to significantly impact the overall count. Therefore, we would expect the number of days on which Team 1 counts a man taller than 183 cm to be similar to the number of days on which Team 2 counts a man taller than 183 cm, within a margin of error of 5%.
