{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any given individual does not change over this time period. Therefore, the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be the same for both teams.

For Team 1, they are surveying three men each day and ranking them by height. On any given day, the probability that the middle man has a height above 183 cm is the same as the probability that a randomly selected man from the population has a height above 183 cm. This is because the distribution of heights in the population is symmetric around the average height of 178 cm, and so the probability that a randomly selected man has a height above the median (which is the same as the average in this case) is the same as the probability that he has a height above any other value.

Similarly, for Team 2, they are surveying only one man each day, and the probability that this man has a height above 183 cm is again the same as the probability that a randomly selected man from the population has a height above 183 cm.

Therefore, both teams should record roughly the same number of days on which the height of the man or men they surveyed is above 183 cm. The difference in the number of days recorded by the two teams should be small, and within 5% of each other.
