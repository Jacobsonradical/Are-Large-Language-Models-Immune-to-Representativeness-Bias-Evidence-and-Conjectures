{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to significantly affect the overall count of days where the surveyed men's height is over 183 cm. While Team 1 is surveying more men each day, the difference in the number of men surveyed between the two teams is not large enough to result in a significant difference in the total count of days where the surveyed men's height exceeds 183 cm.

Therefore, we can expect the total counts of such days for both teams to be similar, within 5% of each other.
