{team: 3}

Both teams are randomly selecting individuals from the same population, so the distribution of heights should be similar for both groups. The key difference is the number of individuals selected each day: Team 1 selects 3 individuals and ranks them, while Team 2 selects only 1 individual.

Let's consider the probability that the middle man in Team 1's survey is taller than 183 cm. For this to happen, at least 2 of the 3 men surveyed by Team 1 must be taller than 183 cm. The probability of this happening in a single day is:

P(at least 2 tall men) = 1 - P(0 tall men) - P(1 tall man)
= 1 - (10/16)^3 - 3*(10/16)*(6/16)^2
≈ 0.014

Now let's calculate the expected number of days in a year that Team 1 records a middle man taller than 183 cm:

Expected days = 365 * 0.014
≈ 5.11

For Team 2, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is simply the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm. We can approximate this probability by assuming that the average height of 178 cm corresponds to the 50th percentile:

P(tall man) = 50% + (183 cm - 178 cm) / (2 * SD)

Assuming a standard deviation (SD) of around 8 cm, we get:

P(tall man) = 50% + (5 cm) / (2 * 8 cm)
= 50% + 0.3125
= 50.3125%

The expected number of days in a year that Team 2 records a tall man is then:

Expected days = 365 * 0.503125
≈ 184.22

Since the expected number of days for Team 2 is much higher than for Team 1, and Team 2 surveys fewer individuals per day, it's reasonable to assume that the totals for both teams will be within 5% of each other. Therefore, I would choose option 3: {team: 3}.
