{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the height of any other man. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team records a man taller than 183 cm should be approximately equal to the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm.

The probability that a man is taller than 183 cm is equal to the fraction of the population whose height exceeds 183 cm. Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, it follows that the fraction of the population whose height exceeds 183 cm is quite small. Therefore, we would expect both teams to record a similar number of days on which they survey a man taller than 183 cm.

Moreover, since the surveys are random, the Law of Large Numbers tells us that the number of such days recorded by each team should converge to the same expected value as the number of surveys they conduct approaches infinity. Therefore, even if one team happened to record more such days than the other in a given year, we would not expect this difference to be large enough to exceed 5%.

In summary, both teams are likely to have recorded a similar number of days on which they surveyed a man taller than 183 cm, and we would expect this number to be within 5% of each other. Therefore, I would answer "3" to this question.
