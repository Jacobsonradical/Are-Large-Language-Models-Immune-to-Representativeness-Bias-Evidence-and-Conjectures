{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be similar for both teams. 

For Team 1, they are surveying 3 men per day and ranking them by height. The middle man's height being above 183 cm is equivalent to saying that at least 2 out of the 3 men surveyed are taller than 183 cm. The probability of this occurring is (1/2)^3 + 3*(1/2)^4 = 5/16, or approximately 31.25%.

For Team 2, they are surveying 1 man per day and simply checking if his height is above 183 cm. The probability of this occurring is 1/2, or approximately 50%.

However, it's important to note that both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the fluctuations in the number of days where the height criteria are met should be relatively small. Specifically, the difference in the number of such days between the two teams should be within 5% of each other. Therefore, my answer is:
