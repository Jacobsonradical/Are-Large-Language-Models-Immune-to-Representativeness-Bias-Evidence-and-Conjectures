{team: 3}

Here's my reasoning:

1. Both teams are surveying men randomly, so the distribution of heights should be similar for both teams.
2. Let's consider the probability that the middle man surveyed by Team 1 is taller than 183 cm. This will only happen if all three men surveyed are taller than 183 cm (since the middle man must be taller than the other two). The probability of this happening is quite low (given that only around 10% of men are taller than 183 cm, as per the provided information).
3. For Team 2, they will simply count the number of days where the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm. The probability of this happening is again around 10%.
4. Although Team 1 is surveying three men each day, the fact that they need to rank the men and find the middle one reduces the likelihood of counting days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm, as compared to Team 2.
5. Due to the randomness and large sample size (365 days), both teams should be close in their counts, and I believe they will be within 5% of each other. However, considering the reduced likelihood for Team 1, I think Team 2 might have a slightly higher count. Still, within 5% is a reasonable conclusion.
