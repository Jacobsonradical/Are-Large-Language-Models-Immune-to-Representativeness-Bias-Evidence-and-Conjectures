{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall count of men whose height exceeds 183 cm. While Team 1 is surveying more men each day, this difference is unlikely to result in a significant divergence in the total counts between the two teams. Therefore, I believe that the two teams are likely to have counted a similar number of days on which the height of the men they surveyed exceeded 183 cm, within 5% of each other.
