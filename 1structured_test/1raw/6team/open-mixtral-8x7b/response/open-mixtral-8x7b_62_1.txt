{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of a year, so the Law of Large Numbers suggests that the sample surveys should be representative of the population. The key difference is the number of men surveyed each day: Team 1 surveys three men and ranks their heights, while Team 2 surveys only one man. 

For Team 1, the probability that the middle man's height is above 183 cm can be approximated by the percentage of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm (which is less than the average height of 178 cm). 

For Team 2, they are simply counting the number of days where the man they survey is taller than 183 cm.

Because both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of a year, the percentage difference in the number of days where the middle man's height (Team 1) or the man surveyed (Team 2) is above 183 cm should be small. Therefore, I believe that the number of such days will be about the same (within 5%) for both teams.
