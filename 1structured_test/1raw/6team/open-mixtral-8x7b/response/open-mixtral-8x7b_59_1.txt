{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of a year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be close to the proportion of all men whose height is above the average height of 178 cm. Specifically, since the height distribution is presumably symmetric around the mean, about half of the men should be taller than 183 cm, or approximately 50 out of 100 men.

Team 1 surveys three men each day, so the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm, raised to the third power (since the event must happen for all three men). This is:

(50/100)^3 = 0.125, or 12.5%

Therefore, we expect Team 1 to record about 365 \* 0.125 = 45.63 days on which the middle man is taller than 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys only one man each day, so the probability that the man they survey is taller than 183 cm is simply the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm, or 0.5. Therefore, we expect Team 2 to record about 365 \* 0.5 = 182.5 days on which the man they survey is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 2 is expected to record more days on which the man they survey is taller than 183 cm than Team 1. However, the difference is not very large, and is only about a 25% increase (182.5 / 146.25, or approximately 1.25). Therefore, I would say that the two teams are about the same (within 5% of each other), since the difference is relatively small.
