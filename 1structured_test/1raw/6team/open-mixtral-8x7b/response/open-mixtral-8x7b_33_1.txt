{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of a year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be similar for both teams. 

For Team 1, they are surveying three men each day and recording the height of the middle man. It's possible that some days the middle man's height is below 183 cm, even if the other two men have heights above 183 cm. Therefore, Team 1's count might be slightly lower than Team 2's count.

However, given that the height distribution is symmetric around the average height of 178 cm, it's also possible that the middle man's height is above 183 cm on more days than the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm. In this case, Team 1's count might be slightly higher than Team 2's count.

Overall, given the symmetric nature of the height distribution and the large sample sizes involved, it's reasonable to expect that the two teams' counts will be approximately the same (within 5% of each other).
