{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm will be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

For Team 1, they are surveying 3 men per day and ranking them by height. However, the key thing to note is that the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of any individual man being taller than 183 cm. This is because the height of the middle man is still independent of the heights of the other two men in the survey. Therefore, the proportion of days on which the middle man is taller than 183 cm will still be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

Similarly, for Team 2, they are surveying only 1 man per day, but the probability of that man being taller than 183 cm is still the same as the probability of any individual man being taller than 183 cm. Therefore, the proportion of days on which the man they survey is taller than 183 cm will also be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

Since both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the probability of encountering a man taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams, we can expect the number of days on which they record such an encounter to be roughly equal. Therefore, I believe that the number of days on which each team records a man taller than 183 cm will be within 5% of each other.
