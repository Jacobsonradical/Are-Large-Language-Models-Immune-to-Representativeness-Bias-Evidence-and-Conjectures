{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the data they collect should be representative of the population. The key difference between the two teams is the number of men they survey each day: Team 1 surveys three men and ranks them by height, while Team 2 surveys only one man.

To determine which team is more likely to record a higher number of days with a man taller than 183 cm, we can compare the probability of such an event for each team.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm on a given day is relatively low, since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average height as there are below it. We can estimate this probability as follows:

* The probability of the shortest man being less than or equal to 178 cm is approximately 1, since this is the average height.
* The probability of the tallest man being greater than or equal to 183 cm is approximately 1/2, since there are as many men above the average height as there are below it.
* Given these probabilities, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is approximately the probability of the shortest man being less than or equal to 178 cm multiplied by the probability of the tallest man being greater than or equal to 183 cm, or 1/2.

For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm on a given day is higher than for Team 1, since they are surveying men independently and not comparing their heights. We can estimate this probability as follows:

* The probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is approximately 1/4, since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average height as there are below it.

Therefore, over the course of the year, Team 2 is more likely to record a higher number of days with a man taller than 183 cm. However, the difference in the number of such days recorded by the two teams is unlikely to be large, since both teams are surveying a large and representative sample of men from the population. I would estimate that the number of such days recorded by the two teams is likely to be within 5% of each other.

In summary, my answer is:

{team: 3}
