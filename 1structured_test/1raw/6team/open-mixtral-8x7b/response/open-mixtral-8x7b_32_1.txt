{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall count of days where the surveyed men's height is above 183 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day, which provides more data points and reduces the impact of any individual measurement. Additionally, by ranking the men by height, Team 1 is more likely to select the middle man who is closer to the average height of the population, reducing the likelihood of selecting men who are significantly taller than 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys only one man each day, which provides fewer data points and increases the impact of any individual measurement. However, because Team 2 is simply counting the number of days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm, rather than ranking them by height, it is still unlikely that their count will differ significantly from Team 1's.

Overall, while there may be some small differences in the counts between the two teams, they are unlikely to be more than 5% of each other. Therefore, I believe that the two teams are about the same in terms of the number of days where the surveyed men's height is above 183 cm.
