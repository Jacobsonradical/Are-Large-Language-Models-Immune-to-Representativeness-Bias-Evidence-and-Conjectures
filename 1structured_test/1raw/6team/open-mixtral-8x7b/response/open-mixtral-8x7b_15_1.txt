{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall count. Furthermore, the condition that there are as many men whose height is above average as there are below average suggests a symmetric distribution of heights around the mean of 178 cm.

While Team 1 is surveying more men per day, the fact that they are ranking them according to height and only counting the days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm introduces an additional source of variability that is not present in Team 2's method. However, given the large sample size and the symmetric distribution of heights, it is unlikely that this difference in methodology will result in a significant difference in the total count of days where the height of the surveyed men is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, we can expect the total counts of Team 1 and Team 2 to be similar, within 5% of each other.
