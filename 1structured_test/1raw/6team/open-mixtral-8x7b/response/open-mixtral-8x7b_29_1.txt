{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is unlikely to significantly affect the overall count of days where the surveyed men's height is above 183 cm. Furthermore, the fact that the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm suggests that the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm is relatively small.

Therefore, both teams are likely to record a similar number of days where the surveyed men's height is above 183 cm, within a 5% margin of error. It is unlikely that the difference in the number of men surveyed each day by the two teams (3 by Team 1 and 1 by Team 2) would result in a significant difference in the overall count of such days.
