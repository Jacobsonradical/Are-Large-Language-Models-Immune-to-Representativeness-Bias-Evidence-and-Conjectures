{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm will be approximately equal to the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm.

The average height of men in the population is 178 cm. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, this means that the distribution of heights is symmetric around 178 cm. Therefore, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man being shorter than 173 cm (183 cm - 178 cm = 5 cm).

To calculate this probability, we can use the empirical rule, which states that for a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% falls within two standard deviations, and 99.7% falls within three standard deviations. Since the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean, we can assume that the standard deviation is approximately 8.5 cm (this is the distance from the mean to the point where 68% of the data falls).

Therefore, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man being more than two standard deviations below the mean. According to the empirical rule, this probability is approximately 2.5% (since 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean, and 5% falls outside of this range).

Since both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, the law of large numbers tells us that the number of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm will converge to the expected proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm. Therefore, we would expect both teams to record roughly the same number of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm.

Specifically, over the course of 365 days, Team 1 will survey a total of 3 x 365 = 1095 men, and the expected number of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm is 1095 x 0.025 = 27.375. Therefore, the number of days on which Team 1 records a man taller than 183 cm will be approximately normally distributed around this mean.

Similarly, Team 2 will survey a total of 1 x 365 = 365 men, and the expected number of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm is 365 x 0.025 = 9.125. Therefore, the number of days on which Team 2 records a man taller than 183 cm will also be approximately normally distributed around this mean.

The standard deviation of the number of days on which Team 1 records a man taller than 183 cm is approximately sqrt(1095 x 0.025 x 0.975) = 5.006. Therefore, the number of days on which Team 1 records a man taller than 183 cm will be approximately normally distributed with a mean of 27.375 and a standard deviation of 5.006.

Similarly, the standard deviation of the number of days on which Team 2 records a man taller than 183 cm is approximately sqrt(365 x 0.025 x 0.975) = 3.526. Therefore, the number of days on which Team 2 records a man taller than 183 cm will be approximately normally distributed with a mean of 9.125 and a standard deviation of 3.526.

We can use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the probability that the number of days on which each team records a man taller than 183 cm falls within one, two, or three standard deviations of the mean.

For Team 1:

* The probability of recording a number of days within one standard deviation of the mean (between 22.369 and 32.381) is approximately 68%.
* The probability of recording a number of days within two standard deviations of the mean (between 17.363 and 37.387) is approximately 95%.
* The probability of recording a number of days within three standard deviations of the mean (between 12.357 and 42.4) is approximately 99.7%.

For Team 2:

* The probability of recording a number of days within one standard deviation of the mean (between 5.1 and 13.15) is approximately 68%.
* The probability of recording a number of days within two standard deviations of the mean (between 1.044 and 17.2) is approximately 95%.
* The probability of recording a number of days within three standard deviations of the mean (between -4.012 and 23.236) is approximately 99.7%.

We can see that the probability of Team 1 recording a number of days within one standard deviation of the mean is relatively high (68%), and the probability of Team 2 recording a number of days within one standard deviation of the mean is also relatively high (68%). Therefore, it is likely that the number of days on which each team records a man taller than 183 cm will be similar (within 5% of each other).

However, there is a small possibility that the number of days on which each team records a man taller than 183 cm could be significantly different (more than 5%). For example, if Team 1 has a particularly lucky streak and surveys a disproportionate number of tall men, they could record a much higher number of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm. Similarly, if Team 2 has a particularly unlucky streak and surveys a disproportionate number of short men, they could record a much lower number of days on which they encounter a man taller than 183 cm.

Overall, I would expect the number of days on which each team records a man taller than 183 cm to be similar (within 5% of each other). However, there is a small possibility that the number of days could be significantly different due to chance.
