{team: 3}

Here's my reasoning:

Let's first find the probability that a single man surveyed has a height greater than 183 cm for each team:
1. For Team 1, they survey three men and rank them by height. In order for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, all three men must be taller than 183 cm or two must be taller than 183 cm and the third is between 178 cm and 183 cm. The probability of this occurring in a single day is quite low, but when calculated over 365 days, it becomes more likely that Team 1 will record more such days.
2. For Team 2, they survey only one man each day. The probability of this man being taller than 183 cm is simply the percentage of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

Now, let's compare the probabilities:
1. For Team 1, the probability of having the middle man taller than 183 cm is low, but let's assume it's approximately 0.1 (10%) for simplicity. Over 365 days, Team 1 would record around 36.5 days with a middle man taller than 183 cm.
2. For Team 2, let's assume 7% of the population is taller than 183 cm. Over 365 days, Team 2 would record around 25.55 days with a man taller than 183 cm.

The difference between the two teams is about 11 days. While Team 1 is more likely to record more days with a man taller than 183 cm, the difference is not large enough to definitively conclude that they will record more than 5% more such days than Team 2. Therefore, I believe the two teams will record similar numbers of days, within 5% of each other.
