{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be similar for both teams. This proportion is approximately equal to the proportion of men whose height is above the average (178 cm) plus half of the remaining proportion of men whose height is between 178 cm and 183 cm.

Assuming that the heights of men are uniformly distributed between 0 cm and 300 cm (a reasonable assumption for this problem), we can calculate this proportion as follows:

* The proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm is (300 - 183) / (300 - 0) = 117 / 297 ≈ 0.3936.
* The proportion of men whose height is between 178 cm and 183 cm is (183 - 178) / (300 - 0) = 5 / 297 ≈ 0.0168.
* Therefore, the total proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm or between 178 cm and 183 cm is 0.3936 + 0.0168 ≈ 0.4104.

This means that, on average, we expect about 41.04% of the surveys conducted by either team to involve a man whose height is above 183 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men per day, so the number of surveys they conduct in a year is 365 x 3 = 1095. We would therefore expect about 1095 x 0.4104 ≈ 450.84 such surveys, or approximately 451 surveys.

Team 2 surveys one man per day, so the number of surveys they conduct in a year is 365. We would therefore expect about 365 x 0.4104 ≈ 150.44 such surveys, or approximately 150 surveys.

The difference between the expected number of surveys conducted by Team 1 and Team 2 is therefore approximately 451 - 150 = 301 surveys. This represents a difference of about 301 / 451 ≈ 66.7% of the expected number of surveys conducted by Team 1.

Therefore, while Team 1 is expected to conduct more surveys involving men whose height is above 183 cm, the difference between the two teams is relatively small (about 67%). This suggests that the two teams are likely to be about the same (within 5% of each other) in terms of the number of such surveys they conduct.
