{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the height of any other man. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will survey a man (or men) taller than 183 cm should be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can estimate that about half of the men in the population are taller than 178 cm and about half are shorter. If we assume that height is roughly normally distributed, then we can estimate that about 2.5% of men in the population are taller than 183 cm (since 183 cm is about 2.5 standard deviations above the mean).

Therefore, we would expect both teams to record a similar number of days where they survey a man (or men) taller than 183 cm, since the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm is relatively small. Specifically, we would expect Team 1 to record approximately 0.025 x 365 x 3 = 27.375 days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm, and we would expect Team 2 to record approximately 0.025 x 365 = 9.125 days where the man they survey is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, we can expect the number of days where the teams record a man (or men) taller than 183 cm to be within 5% of each other. Hence, the answer is 3 (they are about the same, within 5% of each other).
