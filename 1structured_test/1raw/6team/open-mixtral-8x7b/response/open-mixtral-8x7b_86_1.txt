{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams, assuming they are surveying a representative sample of the population.

To be more precise, we can calculate the probability that a team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm on a given day. Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, we can assume that the distribution of heights is roughly normal with a mean of 178 cm and a standard deviation that we can estimate to be around 7 cm (based on the fact that there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average).

Using this assumption, we can calculate that the probability that a randomly selected man will be taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.067, or about 6.7%. Therefore, we would expect Team 1 to encounter a man taller than 183 cm on approximately 20.1 days over the course of the year (365 days * 0.067 probability), and we would expect Team 2 to encounter a man taller than 183 cm on approximately 6.7 days over the course of the year (365 days * 0.0185 probability, since Team 2 is only surveying one man per day).

Therefore, while Team 1 is more likely to encounter a man taller than 183 cm on any given day, the difference in the number of such days between the two teams is relatively small, and is likely to be within 5% of each other.
