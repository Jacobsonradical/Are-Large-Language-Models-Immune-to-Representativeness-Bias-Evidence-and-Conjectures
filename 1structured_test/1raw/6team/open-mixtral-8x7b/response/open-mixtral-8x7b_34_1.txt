{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the heights of other men. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team records a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams.

To be more precise, we can calculate the probability that the middle height of three randomly selected men is greater than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below the average, the median height is also 178 cm. Therefore, the probability that a single randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is:

P(height > 183 cm) = (183 - 178)/(2 \* (25th percentile))

where 25th percentile is the distance between average and median, which is half of the distance between the 25th and 75th percentiles, assuming a normal distribution. This is because the median is the 50th percentile, and the average is the mean of the 25th and 75th percentiles.

Assuming the 25th and 75th percentiles are 172 cm and 184 cm, respectively, the probability that a single randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is:

P(height > 183 cm) = (183 - 178)/(2 \* (184 - 172)) = 5/24 ≈ 0.2083

The probability that the middle height of three randomly selected men is greater than 183 cm is:

P(middle height > 183 cm) = P(height > 183 cm)^3 = (5/24)^3 ≈ 0.0014

Therefore, the expected number of days that Team 1 records a middle height greater than 183 cm is 365 \* 0.0014 ≈ 0.51, or about one day every two years.

Similarly, the probability that the height of a single randomly selected man is greater than 183 cm is:

P(height > 183 cm) = 5/24 ≈ 0.2083

Therefore, the expected number of days that Team 2 records a height greater than 183 cm is 365 \* 0.2083 ≈ 76.32, or about two days every three months.

Since the expected number of days that Team 1 records a middle height greater than 183 cm is so small compared to the expected number of days that Team 2 records a height greater than 183 cm, it is highly likely that Team 2 recorded more such days. However, the difference is so large (a factor of 150) that the teams are not "about the same" within 5% of each other. Therefore, the answer is 3, "about the same (within 5% of each other)".
