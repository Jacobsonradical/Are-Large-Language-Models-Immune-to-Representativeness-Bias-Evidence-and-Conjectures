{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, so the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of men whose height is above 183 cm should be similar for both teams. 

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height, so they are more likely to identify the middle man as being above 183 cm on days when the heights of the men surveyed are more spread out. However, this effect should be small, as the height distribution is likely to be relatively symmetric around the mean of 178 cm.

Team 2 surveys only one man each day, so they are less likely to identify a man as being above 183 cm on days when the man they survey happens to be close to the mean height of 178 cm. However, this effect should also be small, as the chance of surveying a man who is exactly 178 cm tall is quite low.

Overall, I would expect the number of days on which each team identifies a man as being above 183 cm to be similar, within 5% of each other.
