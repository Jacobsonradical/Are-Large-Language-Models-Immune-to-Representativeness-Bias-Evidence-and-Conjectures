{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is presumably independent of the heights of other men in the population. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team records a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly equal to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

To calculate this proportion, we can use the fact that the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and that there are as many men with height above average as there are men with height below average. This means that the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean, and we can estimate the proportion of men taller than 183 cm by finding the proportion of men whose height is more than 178 cm plus half the distance between the mean and 183 cm. That is, we can calculate:

proportion = (183 - 178) / (height variance)^0.5

where height variance is the variance of the height distribution. If we assume that the height variance is around 80 cm^2 (a rough estimate based on data from other populations), then we get:

proportion = (183 - 178) / sqrt(80) â‰ˆ 0.125

This means that we would expect around 12.5% of men in the population to be taller than 183 cm.

Now, let's compare the survey methods of the two teams. Team 1 surveys three men per day and ranks them by height, while Team 2 surveys only one man per day. However, because the height distribution is symmetric around the mean, it is equally likely that the middle man surveyed by Team 1 is taller than 183 cm as it is that he is shorter. Therefore, the probability that Team 1 records a man taller than 183 cm on a given day is the same as the probability that Team 2 records a man taller than 183 cm on a given day, namely 12.5%.

Over the course of a year, we would expect both teams to record roughly the same number of days on which they survey a man taller than 183 cm. Specifically, if we assume that the two teams survey men independently and that the population of men is large enough that the law of large numbers applies, then we can use the binomial distribution to calculate the expected number of days on which each team records a man taller than 183 cm.

For Team 1, the expected number of such days is:

expected count (Team 1) = 365 \* 3 \* 0.125 = 13.625

For Team 2, the expected number of such days is:

expected count (Team 2) = 365 \* 1 \* 0.125 = 4.5625

Although Team 1 is expected to record more days with a man taller than 183 cm, the difference is quite small and within the range of 5%. Therefore, I would expect the two teams to record roughly the same number of such days, with Team 1 recording slightly more. Hence, my answer is:

{team: 3}
