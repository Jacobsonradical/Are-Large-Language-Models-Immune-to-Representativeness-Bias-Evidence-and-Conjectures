{team: 3}

Both teams are surveying a large number of men over the course of the year, and the height of any individual man is independent of the height of any other man. Therefore, the proportion of days on which a team will encounter a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same for both teams.

To be more specific, let's assume that the heights of men in the population are normally distributed with a mean of 178 cm and a standard deviation of, say, 8 cm. Then, the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm is:

P(height > 183 cm) = P(Z > (183 - 178)/8) = P(Z > 0.625)

where Z is a standard normal variable. Using a standard normal table or calculator, we find that:

P(Z > 0.625) â‰ˆ 0.266

This means that, on any given day, we would expect about 26.6% of Team 1's surveys and 26.6% of Team 2's surveys to result in a man taller than 183 cm. Over the course of a year, we would expect both teams to record similar numbers of such days, with any differences being due to random chance.

Therefore, I would guess that the number of days on which Team 1 and Team 2 each recorded a man taller than 183 cm are likely to be within 5% of each other.
