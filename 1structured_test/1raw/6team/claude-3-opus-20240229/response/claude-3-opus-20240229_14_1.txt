To determine which team counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This is more likely than a randomly selected man being above 183 cm, as in Team 2's case, because the middle man is the second tallest out of the three surveyed each day.

For Team 2, the probability of the randomly surveyed man being above 183 cm is lower than the probability of the middle man out of three being above 183 cm.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 1 is expected to count more days meeting their criterion compared to Team 2.
