To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is equal to the probability that at least two out of the three randomly surveyed men are taller than 183 cm. Since half the men are above the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is simply the probability of a randomly chosen man from the population being taller than 183 cm, which is less than 0.5.

The probability for Team 1's event is higher than Team 2's event because Team 1 has a higher chance of surveying at least two men taller than 183 cm out of three, compared to Team 2's chance of surveying one man taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, over the period of 365 days, Team 1 is likely to have counted more days meeting their criteria than Team 2.
