To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, since there are as many men above the average height as below, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm from the population.

For Team 2, they only survey one man each day, so the probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm is also the same as the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm from the population.

Therefore, both teams have the same probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm on any given day. Over the course of 365 days, we would expect both teams to have counted approximately the same number of days where they found a man taller than 183 cm, within a small margin of error.
