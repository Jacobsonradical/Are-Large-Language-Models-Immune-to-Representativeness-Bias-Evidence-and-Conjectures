To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be greater than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5. However, since they select three men each day, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of a single randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, the single man they survey each day needs to be taller than 183 cm. As mentioned before, this probability is less than 0.5.

Therefore, the probability of Team 1 counting a day that meets their criteria is higher than the probability of Team 2 counting a day that meets their criteria.

Over the course of 365 days, this difference in probability is likely to result in Team 1 counting more days that meet their criteria compared to Team 2.
