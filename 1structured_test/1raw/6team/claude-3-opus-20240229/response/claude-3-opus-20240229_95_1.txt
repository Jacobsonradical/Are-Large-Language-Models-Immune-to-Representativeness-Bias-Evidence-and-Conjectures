To determine which team counted more days, we need to analyze the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Team 1:
- Surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man (2nd tallest) is taller than 183 cm.
- For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men must be taller than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys one man each day and counts the days when the man is taller than 183 cm.

Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

Let's denote the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm as p (where p < 0.5).

For Team 1, the probability of at least two out of three men being taller than 183 cm is:
P(Team 1) = p^3 + 3p^2(1-p)

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is simply p.

Since p < 0.5, p^3 and 3p^2(1-p) are both smaller than p. Therefore, P(Team 1) < P(Team 2).

This means that Team 2 is expected to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.
