To determine which team likely counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be greater than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is also less than 50%, as 183 cm is above the average height.

However, Team 1 has a higher chance of encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day because they survey three men each day, and only the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. In contrast, Team 2 only surveys one man per day, so they have fewer chances of finding a man taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 1 counted more days where they found a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2.
