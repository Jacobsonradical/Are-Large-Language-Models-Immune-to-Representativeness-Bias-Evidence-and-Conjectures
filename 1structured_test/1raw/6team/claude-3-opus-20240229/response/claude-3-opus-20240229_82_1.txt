To determine which team is likely to have counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This means that at least two out of the three randomly surveyed men must be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, the single randomly surveyed man needs to be taller than 183 cm. Again, the probability of this occurring is less than 50%.

However, the probability of Team 1 finding at least two men taller than 183 cm out of three is lower than the probability of Team 2 finding one man taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where they encountered a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
