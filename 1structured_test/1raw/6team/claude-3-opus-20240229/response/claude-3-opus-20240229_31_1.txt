To determine which team likely counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height will be taller than 183 cm if at least two out of the three surveyed men are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm, which is less than 50%.

The key difference is that Team 1 has a higher chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day because they survey three men each day, and they only need the middle man to be taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, it is more likely that Team 1 will count more days where they find a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2.
