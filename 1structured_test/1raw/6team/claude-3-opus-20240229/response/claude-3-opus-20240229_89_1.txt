To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height will be greater than 183 cm if at least two out of the three surveyed men are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man from the population being taller than 183 cm, which is less than 50%.

The probability of Team 1 finding a day where the middle man is taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of Team 2 finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day. This is because Team 1 has a higher chance of finding at least two tall men out of three, compared to Team 2's chance of finding one tall man out of one.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, it is more likely that Team 1 will count more days where the condition is met compared to Team 2.
