To determine which team is likely to have counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below the average, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 1/2. In fact, it would be closer to 1/4 or 1/3, as the middle man needs to be taller than both the average and 183 cm.

For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is also less than 1/2, but it would be closer to 1/2 than Team 1's probability since they only need to find one man taller than 183 cm, not the middle of three.

Therefore, Team 2 has a higher probability of counting a day where they surveyed a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1. Over the course of 365 days, this difference in probability is likely to result in Team 2 counting more such days than Team 1.
