To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is equal to the probability that at least two out of the three randomly surveyed men are taller than 183 cm. This is because for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, either the tallest man, or the tallest and the second tallest men must be above 183 cm.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is simply the probability that a randomly selected man from the population is taller than 183 cm.

Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below, 183 cm is likely to be in the upper quartile of the height distribution. This means that the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is likely to be less than 25%.

The probability of at least two out of three men being taller than 183 cm (Team 1's case) is likely to be lower than the probability of one randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm (Team 2's case). Therefore, over the period of 365 days, Team 2 is expected to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
