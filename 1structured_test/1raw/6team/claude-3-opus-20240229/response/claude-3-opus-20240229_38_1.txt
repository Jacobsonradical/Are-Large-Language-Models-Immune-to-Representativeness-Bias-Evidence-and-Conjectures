To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys three men each day and counts the number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.
- For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men must be taller than 183 cm.
- Since the height distribution is symmetric around the average, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.
- The probability of at least two out of three men being taller than 183 cm is even lower.

Team 2:
- Surveys one man each day and counts the number of days on which the height of the man is taller than 183 cm.
- The probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%, but higher than the probability of at least two out of three men being taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to count more days on which they surveyed a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
