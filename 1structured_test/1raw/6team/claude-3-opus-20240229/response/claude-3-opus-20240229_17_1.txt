To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Team 1: Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the middle man's height will be close to the average. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm (which is significantly above the average) is relatively low.

Team 2: This team randomly surveys one man each day. Since there are as many men above the average height as there are below, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is higher than that of the middle man in Team 1's survey.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
