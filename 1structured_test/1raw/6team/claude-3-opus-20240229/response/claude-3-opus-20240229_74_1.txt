To determine which team counted more days, let's consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man out of the three surveyed needs to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, 183 cm is likely to be in the upper quartile of the height distribution. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm would be less than 25%.

For Team 2, the single man surveyed needs to be taller than 183 cm. Again, considering the average height and equal distribution, the probability of this man being taller than 183 cm would be around 25%.

Therefore, Team 2 has a higher probability of counting a day where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.

Over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to count more such days than Team 1.
