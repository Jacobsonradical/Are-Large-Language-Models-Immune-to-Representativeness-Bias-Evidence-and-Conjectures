To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This is more likely than a randomly selected man being above 183 cm (which is Team 2's criterion), because for Team 1, the tallest of the three men can "push up" the middle man's height.

For Team 2, the single randomly surveyed man needs to be above 183 cm, which is less likely than the middle man of three being above 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 1 is expected to count more days meeting their criterion compared to Team 2.

{team: 1}
