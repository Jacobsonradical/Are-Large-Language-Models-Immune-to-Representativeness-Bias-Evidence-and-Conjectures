To determine which team counted more days or if they are about the same, we need to consider the probability of each team selecting a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of at least two out of the three randomly selected men being taller than 183 cm. This is because if at least two men are taller than 183 cm, the middle man will always be taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is simply the probability of a randomly selected man from the population being taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, we can conclude that the height distribution is symmetric. This means that the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5 (50%).

Now, let's compare the probabilities for both teams:

- For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is greater than the probability of a single randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1 selects three men each day, increasing the chances of finding at least two men taller than 183 cm.

- For Team 2, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is simply the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm, which is less than 0.5.

Therefore, Team 1 is more likely to count more days where the height of the middle man is greater than 183 cm compared to Team 2.
