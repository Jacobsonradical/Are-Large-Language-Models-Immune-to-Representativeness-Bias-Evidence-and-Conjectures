To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height must be above 183 cm. This is more likely than a randomly selected man being above 183 cm because the middle man is the second tallest out of the three surveyed.

For Team 2, the single randomly surveyed man must be above 183 cm. This probability is lower than Team 1's case because it's a direct random selection without ranking.

Since Team 1's criterion is more likely to occur on any given day compared to Team 2's, over the course of 365 days, Team 1 would be expected to count more days meeting their condition.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 1}
