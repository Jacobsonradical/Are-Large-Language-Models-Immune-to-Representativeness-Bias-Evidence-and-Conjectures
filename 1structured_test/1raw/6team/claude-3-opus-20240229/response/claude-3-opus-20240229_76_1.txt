To determine which team likely counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Team 1: 
- Surveys 3 men each day and checks if the middle man's height is over 183 cm.
- For the middle man to be over 183 cm, at least 2 out of the 3 men must be taller than 183 cm.
- Since the average height is 178 cm with an equal number of men above and below the average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.
- The probability of at least 2 out of 3 men being taller than 183 cm is even lower.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 man each day and checks if his height is over 183 cm.
- The probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm, which is less than 50%.

Given that the probability of Team 2 finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day is higher than the probability of Team 1 finding at least 2 out of 3 men taller than 183 cm, it is more likely that Team 2 counted more days with a man taller than 183 cm over the 365-day period.
