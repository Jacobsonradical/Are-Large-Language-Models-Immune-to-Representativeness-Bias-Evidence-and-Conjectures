To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This is more likely than a randomly selected man being above 183 cm, as in Team 2's case, since the average height is 178 cm.

Intuitively, if we select three men at random, the chance of the middle height being considerably above average is higher than the chance of a single randomly selected man being considerably above average.

Therefore, I believe Team 1 would have recorded more such days over the period of 365 days.
