To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team selecting a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Team 1:
- They select 3 men each day and rank them by height.
- For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least 2 out of the 3 men must be taller than 183 cm.
- Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.
- The probability of at least 2 out of 3 men being taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- They select only 1 man each day.
- The probability of this man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%, as explained above.

Since the probability of Team 2 counting a day where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of Team 1 counting a day where the middle man is taller than 183 cm, it is likely that Team 2 recorded more such days over the 365-day period.
