To determine which team likely counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team selecting a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height will be greater than 183 cm if at least two out of the three randomly surveyed men are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2, the probability of the single randomly surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability for any one man in Team 1's daily survey, which is less than 0.5.

However, because Team 1 selects three men each day, they have a higher chance of having at least two men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2's single daily selection.

Therefore, Team 1 is more likely to have counted more days where the middle man (or the single man for Team 2) was taller than 183 cm.
