To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Team 1: They survey three men each day and count the days when the middle man (second tallest) is taller than 183 cm. Since the height distribution is symmetric around the mean (178 cm), the probability of the second tallest man being taller than 183 cm is less than 1/2 (because 183 cm is above the mean).

Team 2: They survey one man each day and count the days when the man is taller than 183 cm. The probability of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm is also less than 1/2 (because 183 cm is above the mean).

However, the probability for Team 1 is lower than that for Team 2. This is because for Team 1, not only does the chosen man need to be taller than 183 cm, but he also needs to be the second tallest among the three men surveyed that day.

Therefore, over the period of 365 days, Team 2 is expected to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
