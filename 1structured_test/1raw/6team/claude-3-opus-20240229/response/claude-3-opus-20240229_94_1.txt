To determine which team likely counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man out of the three surveyed needs to be taller than 183 cm. Since the heights are normally distributed, this means at least two out of the three men surveyed that day need to be taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, the single man surveyed needs to be taller than 183 cm.

Given that 183 cm is above the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 1, the probability of at least 2 out of 3 men being taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of 1 out of 1 man being taller than 183 cm for Team 2.

Therefore, over the period of 365 days, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
