To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the middle man's height will be close to the average of 178 cm. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm would be relatively low.

For Team 2, they survey one random man each day. Since there are an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm would be higher than the probability of the middle man in Team 1's survey being taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
