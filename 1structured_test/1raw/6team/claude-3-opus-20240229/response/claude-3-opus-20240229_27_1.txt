To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height will be greater than 183 cm if at least two out of the three randomly surveyed men are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man from the population being taller than 183 cm, which is less than 0.5.

The probability of Team 1 finding at least two men taller than 183 cm out of three is lower than the probability of Team 2 finding one man taller than 183 cm. Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm.
