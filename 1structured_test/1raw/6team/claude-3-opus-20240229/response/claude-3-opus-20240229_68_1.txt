To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below this average, the middle man's height will be around 178 cm. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is also less than 50%, but it is higher than the probability for Team 1's middle man. This is because Team 2 can survey any man from the population, not just the middle man out of a group of three.

Over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to count more days where they surveyed a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
