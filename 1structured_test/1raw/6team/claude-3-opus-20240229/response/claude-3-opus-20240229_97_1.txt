To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team selecting a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Team 1: Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the middle man's height will be close to the average. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm (which is significantly above the average) is relatively low.

Team 2: This team randomly surveys one man each day. Since there are as many men above the average height as there are below, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of the middle man in Team 1's survey being taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, it is more likely that Team 2 counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
