To determine which team counted more days or if they are about the same, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of at least two out of the three randomly surveyed men being taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below the average, the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is simply the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm, which, as mentioned before, is less than 0.5.

The probability of Team 1 finding a middle man taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of Team 2 finding a man taller than 183 cm because Team 1 has more chances (surveying three men each day) to find tall men.

Therefore, over the period of 365 days, Team 1 is likely to have counted more days where they found men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2.
