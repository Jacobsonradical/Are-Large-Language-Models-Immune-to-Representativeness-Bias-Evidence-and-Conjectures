To determine which team likely counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the median height is also 178 cm. This means that the middle man out of the three surveyed each day has a 50% chance of being taller than the median. However, 183 cm is higher than the median, so the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm each day is the same as the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm. Since 183 cm is higher than the average of 178 cm, this probability is less than 50%.

While we don't have exact figures, we can assume that the probability of Team 2 surveying a man taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of Team 1's middle man being taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2's probability is directly based on the population proportion, while Team 1's probability is further reduced by the fact that they are considering the middle height out of three.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, it's likely that Team 2 counted more days where they surveyed a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
