To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be greater than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5. Let's assume it's around 0.2 (20%).

For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men surveyed that day must be taller than 183 cm. The probability of this occurring is:

P(at least 2 out of 3 men > 183 cm) = P(2 men > 183 cm) + P(3 men > 183 cm)
= (0.2)^2 * (0.8) * 3 + (0.2)^3
≈ 0.096 + 0.008
≈ 0.104 (10.4%)

For Team 2, the probability of the single man surveyed being taller than 183 cm is simply 0.2 (20%).

Since Team 2's probability (20%) is significantly higher than Team 1's probability (10.4%), Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days meeting their criteria over the 365-day period.
