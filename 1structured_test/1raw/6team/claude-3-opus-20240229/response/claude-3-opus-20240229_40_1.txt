To determine which team is likely to have counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Team 1: 
- Surveys three men each day and counts the day if the middle man (median) is taller than 183 cm.
- For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men must be taller than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys one man each day and counts the day if the man is taller than 183 cm.

Given that the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, 183 cm is likely to be in the upper tail of the height distribution.

The probability of Team 2 encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day is higher than the probability of Team 1 encountering at least two men taller than 183 cm out of three on a given day.

Therefore, over the period of 365 days, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm.
