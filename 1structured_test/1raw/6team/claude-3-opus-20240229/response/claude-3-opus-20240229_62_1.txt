To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This is more likely than a randomly selected man being above 183 cm, as in Team 2's case, because the middle man is the second tallest out of the three surveyed.

For Team 2, the probability of the randomly selected man being above 183 cm is lower, as it is a direct random selection from the population.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below this average, 183 cm is likely in the upper percentiles of the height distribution.

Therefore, Team 1 has a higher probability of meeting their criteria on any given day, and over the course of 365 days, they are likely to count more days than Team 2.
