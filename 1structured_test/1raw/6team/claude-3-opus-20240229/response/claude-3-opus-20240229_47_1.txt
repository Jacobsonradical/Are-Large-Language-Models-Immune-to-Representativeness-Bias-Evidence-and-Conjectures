To determine which team likely counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height will be greater than 183 cm if at least two out of the three surveyed men are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is the same as for any individual man in Team 1's survey, which is less than 0.5.

However, because Team 1 surveys more men each day, they have a higher probability of finding at least two men taller than 183 cm on any given day compared to Team 2's single survey. This means that over the course of the year, Team 1 is likely to count more days where they found men taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 1}
