To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them by height.
- The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 1/2, as the average height is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men above and below the average.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- The probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is also less than 1/2, for the same reason as above.

However, the probability for Team 2 is higher than the probability for Team 1 because:
- For Team 1, the middle man needs to be taller than 183 cm, which means at least two out of the three men surveyed that day must be taller than 183 cm.
- For Team 2, only the one surveyed man needs to be taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm.
