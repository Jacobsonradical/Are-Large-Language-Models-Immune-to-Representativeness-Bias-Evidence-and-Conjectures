To determine which team is likely to have counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 1/2 since the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below this average.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is also less than 1/2 for the same reason.

However, the key difference is that Team 1 surveys three men each day, which increases the likelihood of the middle man being taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2, who only surveys one man per day.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, it is more probable that Team 1 would count more days meeting their criteria than Team 2.
