To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each event happening for the respective teams.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be more than 183 cm. This means that at least two out of the three men surveyed should be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below the average, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2, the surveyed man's height needs to be more than 183 cm. As mentioned earlier, the probability of this event is less than 0.5.

Now, let's compare the probabilities:
- The probability of at least two out of three men being taller than 183 cm (Team 1) is lower than the probability of one man being taller than 183 cm (Team 2).

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the surveyed man's height is above 183 cm.
