To determine which team counted more days meeting their respective criteria, let's consider the probability of each event happening on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be more than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men surveyed that day must be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm with an equal number of men above and below the average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, the single man surveyed that day needs to be taller than 183 cm. As mentioned before, this probability is less than 50%.

However, the probability of at least two out of three men being taller than 183 cm (Team 1's criterion) is lower than the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm (Team 2's criterion). This is because Team 1's criterion requires a majority of the surveyed men to be taller than 183 cm, while Team 2's criterion only requires one man to meet the condition.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to count more days that meet their criterion compared to Team 1.
