To determine which team counted more days or if they are about the same, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, since the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%. This is because 183 cm is above the average height.

For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is also less than 50%, for the same reason as Team 1.

However, the key difference is that Team 1 surveys three men each day, which increases their chances of finding at least one man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2, who only surveys one man per day.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, it is more likely that Team 1 will count more days where they found a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2.
