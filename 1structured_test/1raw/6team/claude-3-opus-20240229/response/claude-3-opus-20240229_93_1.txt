To determine which team counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be greater than 183 cm. This means that at least two out of the three randomly surveyed men must be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2, the single surveyed man needs to be taller than 183 cm. Again, the probability of this occurring is less than 0.5.

The probability of Team 1's event (at least 2 out of 3 men taller than 183 cm) is lower than the probability of Team 2's event (1 man taller than 183 cm). This is because Team 1's event requires a more stringent condition to be met.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to count more days meeting their criterion compared to Team 1.

{team: 2}
