To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the height of the middle man will be greater than 183 cm if at least two out of the three surveyed men are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man from the population being taller than 183 cm, which is less than 50%.

Although the exact probabilities are not given, we can infer that Team 2 has a higher chance of counting more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1 requires at least two out of three men to be taller than 183 cm, which is less likely than Team 2's requirement of just one man being taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
