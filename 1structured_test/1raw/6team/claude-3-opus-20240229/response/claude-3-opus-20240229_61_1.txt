To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This is more likely than randomly selecting a single man above 183 cm, as done by Team 2. Why? Because for the middle man to be above 183 cm, at least two out of the three men need to be above 183 cm, which is more probable than a single randomly selected man being above 183 cm.

Therefore, over the period of 365 days, Team 1 is expected to count more days meeting their criteria compared to Team 2.
