To determine which team likely counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Team 1: Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the median height is also 178 cm. In a group of three randomly selected men, the probability that the middle man (median) is taller than 183 cm is less than 1/2, as 183 cm is above the population median.

Team 2: The probability of a single randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is also less than 1/2, for the same reason as above.

However, the probability for Team 1 is lower than that for Team 2. This is because for Team 1, the middle man needs to be taller than 183 cm, which is a more stringent requirement than just selecting a single man taller than 183 cm, as Team 2 does.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is expected to count more days where they surveyed a man taller than 183 cm compared to the number of days Team 1 found the middle man to be taller than 183 cm.
