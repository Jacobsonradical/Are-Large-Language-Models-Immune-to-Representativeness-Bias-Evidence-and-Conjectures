To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, since they survey three men each day and rank them by height, the middle man would be taller than 183 cm if at least two out of the three men are taller than 183 cm. Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2, they only need to survey one man taller than 183 cm on a given day to count it. The probability of this occurring is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm, which is less than 0.5.

Since the probability of Team 1 encountering a day where the middle man is taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of Team 2 surveying a man taller than 183 cm on a given day, it is likely that Team 2 will count more such days over the period of 365 days.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
