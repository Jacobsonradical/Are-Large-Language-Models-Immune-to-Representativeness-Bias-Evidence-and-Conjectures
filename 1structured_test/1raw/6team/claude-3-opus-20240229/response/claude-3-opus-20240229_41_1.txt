To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This is more likely than a randomly selected man being above 183 cm, as in Team 2's case, because the middle man is the second tallest out of the three surveyed.

For Team 2, the probability of the single man surveyed being above 183 cm is lower, as it's a direct random selection from the population.

Given that the average height is 178 cm, a height above 183 cm is relatively rare in the population. Team 1 has a higher chance of encountering such a height each day due to their survey method.

Therefore, over the period of 365 days, Team 1 is more likely to have counted more days meeting their criteria compared to Team 2.
