To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be greater than 183 cm. This is more likely than a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm because the middle man is the second tallest out of the three surveyed.

For Team 2, the randomly selected man needs to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

Therefore, Team 1 is more likely to count more days meeting their criteria compared to Team 2.
