To determine which team is likely to have counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm. This is because for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three randomly selected men need to be taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is equal to the probability of a randomly selected man from the population being taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
