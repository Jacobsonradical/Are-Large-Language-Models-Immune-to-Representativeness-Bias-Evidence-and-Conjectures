To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each team's condition being met on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%. However, by selecting three men each day, the chances of the middle man being taller than 183 cm are higher than selecting just one man above 183 cm.

For Team 2, the single surveyed man needs to be taller than 183 cm. As mentioned above, the probability of this is less than 50% due to the average height being 178 cm.

Considering these factors, Team 1 is more likely to have counted more days meeting their criteria compared to Team 2. This is because Team 1 has a higher chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm among three randomly selected men each day, compared to Team 2's single daily selection.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 1}
