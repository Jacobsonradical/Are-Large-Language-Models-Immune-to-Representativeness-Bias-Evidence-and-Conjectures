To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Team 1: Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the median height is also 178 cm. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183 cm. This probability is lower than the probability of a single randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm.

Team 2: The team surveys one man each day, and the probability of this man being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of Team 1 finding at least two out of three men taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
