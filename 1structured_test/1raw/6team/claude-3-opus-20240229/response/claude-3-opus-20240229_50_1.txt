To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Team 1: They survey three men each day and count the day if the middle man (the second tallest) is over 183 cm. For this to happen, at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm. Since the height distribution is symmetric around the average of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

Team 2: They survey one man each day and count the day if that man is taller than 183 cm. The probability of this happening is the same as the probability of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm, which is less than 50%.

The probability of Team 1 counting a day is lower than that of Team 2 because Team 1 requires at least two out of three men to be taller than 183 cm, whereas Team 2 only requires one man to be taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days than Team 1.
