To determine which team likely counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height will be greater than 183 cm if at least two out of the three men surveyed are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2, the probability of the single man surveyed being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability for any individual man in the population, which is less than 0.5.

Because the probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5 for both teams, we can expect that both teams will count such men on fewer than half of the days (182.5 days).

However, the probability for Team 1 is higher than that for Team 2, because Team 1 has three chances each day to find a tall man, while Team 2 has only one chance. Therefore, Team 1 is more likely to have counted more days where they found a man taller than 183 cm.
