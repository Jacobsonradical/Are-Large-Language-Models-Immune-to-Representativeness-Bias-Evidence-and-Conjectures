To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below the average, the median height is also 178 cm. This means that the middle man out of the three surveyed each day has a 50% chance of being taller than the median (178 cm). However, the question asks about the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm, which is higher than the median. This probability will be less than 50%, let's call it p1.

For Team 2, the probability of the single man surveyed each day being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man from the population being taller than 183 cm. This probability, let's call it p2, will be lower than 50% since 183 cm is above the average height.

Comparing p1 and p2, we can see that p1 is likely to be higher than p2. This is because the middle man out of three randomly selected men has a higher chance of being taller than 183 cm compared to a single randomly selected man.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 1 is likely to count more days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm compared to the number of days Team 2 counts a man taller than 183 cm.
