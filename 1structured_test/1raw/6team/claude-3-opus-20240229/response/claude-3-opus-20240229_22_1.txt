To determine which team counted more days or if they are about the same, we need to consider the probability of each team recording a height above 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height will be above 183 cm if at least two out of the three surveyed men are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below the average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man from the population being taller than 183 cm, which is less than 0.5.

Since the probability of Team 1 recording a height above 183 cm (at least 2 out of 3 men) is less than the probability of Team 2 recording a height above 183 cm (1 man), it is more likely that Team 2 counted more such days over the period of 365 days.
