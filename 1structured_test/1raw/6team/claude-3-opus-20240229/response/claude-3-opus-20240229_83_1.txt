To determine which team is likely to have counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team selecting a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height will be greater than 183 cm if at least two out of the three men surveyed are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, the probability of the single man surveyed being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability for any individual man in the population, which is less than 50%.

However, the probability of Team 1 selecting at least two men taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of Team 2 selecting one man taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1's condition requires a majority of the surveyed men to be taller than 183 cm, while Team 2's condition is satisfied by a single tall man.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm.
