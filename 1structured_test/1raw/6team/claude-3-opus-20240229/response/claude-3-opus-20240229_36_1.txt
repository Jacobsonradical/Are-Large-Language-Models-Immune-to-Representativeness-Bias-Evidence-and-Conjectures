Here's my analysis:

Team 1 selects the middle height man out of 3 each day. For the middle man to be over 183cm, at least 2 of the 3 men need to be over 183cm tall on a given day. This is less likely than 1 out of 3 men being over 183cm on average.

In contrast, Team 2 just needs the 1 man they select each day to be over 183cm tall to count that day.

Since the average male height is 178cm, men over 183cm are in the upper 50% of height. So on average, Team 2 will count about 50% of days (since 1 out of 2 men are over 183cm in the population).

For Team 1 to also count about 50% of days, the probability of at least 2 out of 3 men being over 183cm would need to be 50%. But if we randomly select 3 men, the probability of getting at least 2 over 183cm is less than 50%. It's actually 50% * 50% * 3 = 37.5%.

So Team 1 will likely count fewer days over 365 days than Team 2 will.
