To determine which team likely counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, since the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%. This is because 183 cm is above the average height.

For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is also less than 50%, for the same reason as above.

However, Team 1's probability is likely higher than Team 2's. This is because Team 1 has a higher chance of including at least one man taller than 183 cm in their daily sample of three men, compared to Team 2's single daily survey.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 1 is likely to have counted more days where they found a man (the middle man) taller than 183 cm, compared to Team 2.
