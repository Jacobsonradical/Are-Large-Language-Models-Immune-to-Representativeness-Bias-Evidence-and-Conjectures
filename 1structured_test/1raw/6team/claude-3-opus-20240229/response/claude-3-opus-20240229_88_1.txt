To determine which team counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below the average, the probability of a randomly selected man being above 183 cm is less than 50%. Let's denote this probability as p, where p < 0.5.

For Team 1 to count a day, the middle man out of the three surveyed must be above 183 cm. This is equivalent to at least two out of the three men being above 183 cm. The probability of this event is:

P(at least 2 out of 3 above 183 cm) = p^3 + 3p^2(1-p)

For Team 2, the probability of counting a day is simply the probability of the one man surveyed being above 183 cm, which is p.

Since p < 0.5, p^3 + 3p^2(1-p) < p. This means that the probability of Team 1 counting a day is lower than the probability of Team 2 counting a day.

Over a large number of days (365), we expect Team 2 to count more days meeting their criteria than Team 1.
