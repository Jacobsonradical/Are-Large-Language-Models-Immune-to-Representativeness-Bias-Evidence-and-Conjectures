To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Team 1: Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below this average, the middle man's height will be close to the average. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm (which is significantly above the average) will be relatively low.

Team 2: This team surveys only one man each day. Since there are equal numbers of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of this man being taller than 183 cm will be higher than the probability for Team 1's middle man.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
