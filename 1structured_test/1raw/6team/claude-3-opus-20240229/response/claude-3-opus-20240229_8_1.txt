To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height will be greater than 183 cm if at least two out of the three surveyed men are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man from the population being taller than 183 cm, which is less than 50%.

Given that both probabilities are less than 50%, the team that surveys more men per day is more likely to count more days where the height condition is met. Team 1 surveys three men per day, while Team 2 surveys only one man per day.

Therefore, Team 1 is more likely to have counted more days where the height condition was met.
