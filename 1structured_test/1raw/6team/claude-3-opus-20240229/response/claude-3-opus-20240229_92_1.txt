To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below the average, the middle man's height will be close to the average. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm (which is significantly above the average) will be relatively low.

For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is higher than Team 1's probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm, as Team 2 can survey any man from the population, not just the middle man out of three.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
