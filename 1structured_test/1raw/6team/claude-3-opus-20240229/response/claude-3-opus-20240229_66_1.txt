To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, since the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%. This is because 183 cm is above the average height.

For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is also less than 50%, for the same reason as above.

However, Team 1's probability is higher than Team 2's. This is because Team 1 surveys three men each day and selects the middle height, which is more likely to be closer to the average (178 cm) than an individual randomly surveyed by Team 2.

Therefore, over the period of 365 days, Team 2 is expected to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
