To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man out of the three surveyed will be taller than 183 cm if at least two of the three men are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2, the probability of the single man surveyed being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability for any individual man in the population, which is less than 0.5.

The probability for Team 1 is higher than that for Team 2 because Team 1 has more chances (3 men per day) to find men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2 (1 man per day).

Therefore, over the period of 365 days, Team 1 is more likely to have counted more days where they found men taller than 183 cm.
