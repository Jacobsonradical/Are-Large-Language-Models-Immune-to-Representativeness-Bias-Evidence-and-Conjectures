To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This is more likely than a randomly selected man being above 183 cm, as in Team 2's case, because the middle man is the second tallest out of the three surveyed.

For Team 2, the probability of the randomly selected man being above 183 cm is lower, as it's a direct random selection from the population.

Since the average male height is 178 cm, which is below 183 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being above 183 cm is less than 50%.

Therefore, Team 1 is more likely to have counted more days meeting their criteria over the 365-day period.
