To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This is more likely than a randomly selected individual being above 183 cm, as in Team 2's case, because the middle man is the second tallest out of the three surveyed.

For Team 2, the probability of the single randomly surveyed man being above 183 cm is lower, as it's equivalent to the probability of a random man from the population exceeding 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above this average as below, 183 cm is notably higher than the average (median) height. Thus, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 1 is more likely to have counted more days meeting their criterion compared to Team 2.
