To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm. This is because for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three randomly selected men must be taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, the probability of the randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is simply the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below the average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

Therefore, the probability of Team 1 encountering a day where the middle man is taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of Team 2 encountering a day where the randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm.

Over a period of 365 days, Team 1 is likely to have counted more days where the middle man was taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2.
