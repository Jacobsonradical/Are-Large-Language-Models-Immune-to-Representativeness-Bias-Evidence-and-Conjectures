To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each team's daily event occurring.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man's height being over 183 cm is equal to the probability that at least two out of the three randomly chosen men are taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, the probability is simply the probability that the one man surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below this average, 183 cm is likely to be significantly above average. This means that the probability of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

In this case, the probability of Team 2's event (one man taller than 183 cm) is likely to be higher than the probability of Team 1's event (at least two out of three men taller than 183 cm).

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days meeting their criterion compared to Team 1.
