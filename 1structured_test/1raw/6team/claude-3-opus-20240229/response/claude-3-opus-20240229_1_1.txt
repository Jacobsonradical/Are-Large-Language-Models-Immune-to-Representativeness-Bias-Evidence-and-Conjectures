To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the height of the middle man will be greater than 183 cm if at least two out of the three men surveyed are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2, the probability of the single man surveyed being taller than 183 cm is also less than 0.5, for the same reason as above.

However, the probability of Team 1 encountering at least two men taller than 183 cm out of three is lower than the probability of Team 2 encountering one man taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1's condition is more stringent, requiring at least two out of three men to meet the criteria, whereas Team 2 only needs one man to meet the criteria.

Therefore, over the period of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where they surveyed a man taller than 183 cm compared to the number of days Team 1 encountered a middle man taller than 183 cm.
