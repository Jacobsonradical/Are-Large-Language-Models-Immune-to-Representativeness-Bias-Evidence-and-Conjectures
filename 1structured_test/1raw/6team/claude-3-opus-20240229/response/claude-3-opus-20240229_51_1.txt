To determine which team counted more days or if they are about the same, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50% since the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below the average.

For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is also less than 50% for the same reason.

However, Team 1 has a higher chance of encountering a man taller than 183 cm on any given day because they survey three men each day, and the height of the middle man is considered. This means that even if the tallest man is not over 183 cm, the middle man might be.

On the other hand, Team 2 only surveys one man per day, so their probability of encountering a man taller than 183 cm is lower than Team 1's.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 1 recorded more days where the height of the middle man was taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2.
