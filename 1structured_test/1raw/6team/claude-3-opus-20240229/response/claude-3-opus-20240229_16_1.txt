To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each team encountering a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are an equal number of men above and below the average height.

Team 1: 
- Surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man (2nd tallest) is taller than 183 cm.
- For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two of the three men must be taller than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys one man each day and counts the days when the man is taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 1, the probability of at least two out of three men being taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of one man being taller than 183 cm (Team 2's case). This is because Team 1 requires a majority of the surveyed men to be above 183 cm, while Team 2 only needs one man to meet the criteria.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to count more days meeting their criteria than Team 1.
