To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

Team 1:
- Each day, they survey three men and rank them by height.
- The middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm to count.
- For this to happen, at least two out of the three men must be taller than 183 cm.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below the average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.
- The probability of at least two out of three men being taller than 183 cm is even lower.

Team 2:
- Each day, they survey one man.
- The man's height needs to be above 183 cm to count.
- The probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%, as mentioned earlier.

Comparing the two teams:
- Team 1 has a lower probability of counting a day because they need at least two out of three men to be taller than 183 cm.
- Team 2 has a higher probability of counting a day because they only need one man to be taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, over the period of 365 days, it is more likely that Team 2 counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm.
