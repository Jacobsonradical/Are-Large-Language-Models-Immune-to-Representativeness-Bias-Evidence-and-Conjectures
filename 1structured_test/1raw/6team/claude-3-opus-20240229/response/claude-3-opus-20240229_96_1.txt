To determine which team counted more days or if they are about the same, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below the average, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is also less than 50%, as the average height is 178 cm.

However, the probability for Team 1 is lower than that for Team 2. For Team 1, two out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. For Team 2, only one man needs to be taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
