To determine which team counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, the single man surveyed needs to be taller than 183 cm. As mentioned, the probability of this occurring is less than 50%.

However, the probability of at least two out of three men being taller than 183 cm (Team 1's criterion) is lower than the probability of one man being taller than 183 cm (Team 2's criterion). This is because Team 1's criterion requires a more extreme event (at least 2 out of 3 being tall) compared to Team 2's criterion (just 1 tall person).

Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to count more days meeting their criterion compared to Team 1.
