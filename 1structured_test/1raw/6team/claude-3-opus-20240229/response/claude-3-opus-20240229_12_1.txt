To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This is more likely than a randomly selected man being above 183 cm, as in Team 2's case, since the average height is 178 cm.

Intuitively, if we select three men, the chance of the middle height being a more extreme value (like above 183 cm) is higher than if we select just one man at random.

Therefore, Team 1 is expected to have counted more days meeting their criterion compared to Team 2.
