To determine which team counted more days, we need to consider the probability of each team finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man out of the three surveyed needs to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, the single man surveyed needs to be taller than 183 cm. Again, since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below this average, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is also less than 50%.

However, the probability for Team 2 is higher than that for Team 1, because for Team 1, not only does the middle man need to be taller than 183 cm, but also at least one of the other two men surveyed needs to be even taller. This additional requirement reduces the probability for Team 1 compared to Team 2.

Therefore, over the period of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm.
