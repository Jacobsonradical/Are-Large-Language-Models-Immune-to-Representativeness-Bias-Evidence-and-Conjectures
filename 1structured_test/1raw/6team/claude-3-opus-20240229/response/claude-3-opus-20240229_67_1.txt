To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This is more likely than a randomly selected man being above 183 cm, as in Team 2's case, since the average height is 178 cm.

Intuitively, if we select 3 men at random, the chance of the middle height being a more extreme value (like over 183 cm) is higher than if we select just 1 man at random.

Therefore, Team 1 is expected to have counted more days meeting their criteria compared to Team 2.
