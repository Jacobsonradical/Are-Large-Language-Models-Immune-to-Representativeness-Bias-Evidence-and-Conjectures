To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This is more likely than a randomly selected man being above 183 cm, as in Team 2's case, because the middle man is the second tallest out of the three surveyed each day.

For Team 2, the probability of the single randomly surveyed man being above 183 cm is lower, as it is closer to the far end of the height distribution.

Therefore, Team 1 is expected to have counted more days meeting their criteria compared to Team 2.

{team: 1}
