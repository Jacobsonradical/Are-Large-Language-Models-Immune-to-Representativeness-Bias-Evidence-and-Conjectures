To determine which team likely counted more days meeting their respective criteria, we need to consider the probability of each event occurring on a given day.

For Team 1, the middle man's height needs to be above 183 cm. This is more likely than a randomly selected individual being above 183 cm, as in Team 2's case, because the middle man is the second tallest out of the three surveyed each day.

For Team 2, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of the middle man out of three randomly selected men being taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 1 is expected to have recorded more days meeting their criteria compared to Team 2.

{team: 1}
