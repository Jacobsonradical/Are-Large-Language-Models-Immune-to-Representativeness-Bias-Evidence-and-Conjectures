To determine which team counted more days where the height exceeded 183 cm, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

**Team 1:**
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
- The team ranks these three men by height.
- They count the days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

**Team 2:**
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- They count the days where this man's height is more than 183 cm.

Given that the average height of men is 178 cm, and the heights are symmetrically distributed around the average, we can infer:
- Half of the men are taller than 178 cm.
- Half of the men are shorter than 178 cm.

When Team 1 surveys three men:
- The middle man's height will be less than 183 cm if the tallest man's height is less than or equal to 183 cm.
- The middle man's height will be more than 183 cm only if at least two of the three men surveyed are taller than 183 cm.

When Team 2 surveys one man:
- The probability that this man is taller than 183 cm is the same as the proportion of men in the population taller than 183 cm.

Given the symmetry and the average height, it is reasonable to assume that the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is less than 50% of the population. However, this proportion will still be reflected in the counts by both teams.

Team 1's method of surveying three men and focusing on the middle man introduces more variability and a lower threshold for counting days because it requires at least two men out of three to be taller than 183 cm. Team 2's method is more straightforward and directly reflects the proportion of men taller than 183 cm in the population.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the height exceeds 183 cm.
