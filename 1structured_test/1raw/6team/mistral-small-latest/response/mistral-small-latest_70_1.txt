To determine which team counted more days with the specified criteria, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the methodology of each team's survey.

Given that the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can infer that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean. This means that the heights are normally distributed with a mean of 178 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm. The probability that the middle man's height is more than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights. Since the distribution is symmetric and the average height is 178 cm, the probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm is less than 50%. Therefore, the probability that the middle man in a group of three has a height greater than 183 cm is also less than 50%.

Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days on which the height of the man is more than 183 cm. The probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm is the same as the probability that the middle man in a group of three has a height greater than 183 cm. Therefore, the expected number of days counted by Team 2 is within 5% of the expected number of days counted by Team 1.

Based on this analysis, I believe that the number of days counted by both teams will be about the same (within 5% of each other).
