To determine which team counted more days when the criteria for a man's height being more than 183 cm was met, we need to consider the distributions and sampling methods used by each team.

### Team 1
Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below, the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean.

For the middle man's height to be more than 183 cm:
- The shortest man can be any height.
- The middle man must be taller than 183 cm.
- The tallest man can be any height taller than the middle man.

The probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm can be estimated by considering the normal distribution characteristics. Since the mean is 178 cm and the standard deviation is not provided, we assume a typical distribution. The height of 183 cm is approximately one standard deviation above the mean, so the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is roughly 15.87% (since the area under the standard normal curve to the right of 1 is 15.87%).

### Team 2
Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when this man's height is more than 183 cm. The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is the same as calculated above, which is approximately 15.87%.

### Comparison
- **Team 1**: The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm on any given day is lower than 15.87% because not all three men can be taller than 183 cm simultaneously.
- **Team 2**: The probability of the single man being taller than 183 cm on any given day is exactly 15.87%.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

### Conclusion
{team: 2}
