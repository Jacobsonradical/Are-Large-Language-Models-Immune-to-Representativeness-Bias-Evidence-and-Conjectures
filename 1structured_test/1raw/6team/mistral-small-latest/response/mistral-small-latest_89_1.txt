To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed men was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the method of sampling used by each team.

Given that:
- The average height of men is 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

This implies a symmetric distribution around the mean. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability that he is shorter than 173 cm (since 183 - 178 = 178 - 173).

### Team 1:
Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man in height is taller than 183 cm. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two of the three men must be taller than 183 cm. The probability that at least two out of three men are taller than 183 cm can be calculated with the binomial distribution.

The probability that a single man is taller than 183 cm is \( p \). The probability that at least two out of three men are taller than 183 cm is given by:
\[ P(\text{at least 2 out of 3}) = \binom{3}{2} p^2 (1-p) + \binom{3}{3} p^3 \]
\[ = 3p^2 (1-p) + p^3 \]

### Team 2:
Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when the man is taller than 183 cm. The probability that a single man is taller than 183 cm is simply \( p \).

### Comparison:
To compare the two probabilities, we need to estimate \( p \). Since the distribution is symmetric, the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is likely less than 50%. Let's assume \( p \) is around 0.3 for simplicity (this would depend on the exact distribution, which is not provided).

For Team 1:
\[ P(\text{at least 2 out of 3}) = 3(0.3)^2(0.7) + (0.3)^3 \]
\[ = 3(0.09)(0.7) + 0.027 \]
\[ = 0.252 + 0.027 \]
\[ = 0.279 \]

For Team 2:
\[ P(\text{one man is taller than 183 cm}) = 0.3 \]

Clearly, \( 0.279 \) (Team 1) is less than \( 0.3 \) (Team 2).

### Conclusion:
Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height of the surveyed men is more than 183 cm.
