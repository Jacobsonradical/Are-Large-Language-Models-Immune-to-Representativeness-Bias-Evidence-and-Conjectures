To determine which team recorded more days where the height of the surveyed individual(s) was above 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the methodology of each team's data collection.

Given that the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average height as there are below, we can infer that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean. This implies that the number of men with heights above 183 cm is less than the number of men with heights between 178 cm and 183 cm, and also less than the number of men with heights below 178 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm. Since the middle man's height is likely to be close to the average height (178 cm), the probability that the middle man's height is more than 183 cm is relatively low.

Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days on which the height of the man is more than 183 cm. Since the number of men with heights above 183 cm is less than those with heights between 178 cm and 183 cm, the probability that a randomly selected man has a height above 183 cm is also relatively low.

However, Team 2 is surveying only one man per day, so the likelihood of selecting a man with a height above 183 cm is higher than the likelihood of the middle man in Team 1's survey having a height above 183 cm.

Therefore, it is likely that Team 2 recorded more days where the height of the surveyed individual was above 183 cm.
