To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed individuals was more than 183 cm, we need to analyze the survey methods and the distribution of heights in the population.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

This implies that the height distribution is symmetric around the average height of 178 cm.

**Team 1 Analysis:**
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
- They rank these three men by height and count the days when the middle man (second tallest) is taller than 183 cm.
- For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, both the tallest and the shortest men in the group of three must be shorter or equal to 183 cm.

**Team 2 Analysis:**
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- They count the days when this man is taller than 183 cm.

To compare the counts from both teams, we need to consider the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm.

**Probability Calculation:**
- Let \( p \) be the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm.
- For Team 1, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is the probability that both the tallest and shortest are ≤ 183 cm, which involves more complex combinatorial calculations. However, since the distribution is symmetric, we can approximate this probability as being less than \( p \) due to the requirement for two men to be shorter.
- For Team 2, the probability is directly \( p \).

Given the symmetry and the requirement that both the tallest and shortest need to be ≤ 183 cm for Team 1, it is likely that the number of days Team 2 counts will be higher than or equal to Team 1.

Therefore, the answer is:

```
{team: 2}
