To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed individual(s) was more than 183 cm, we need to understand the distribution of heights in the population and the sampling methods of both teams.

Given:
- The average height of men is 178 cm.
- There are as many men above the average height as there are below the average height.

This implies that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean of 178 cm. Since the population is symmetric, the proportion of men taller than 183 cm will be less than the proportion of men shorter than 173 cm (178 cm - 5 cm = 173 cm).

### Team 1:
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- The middle man's height is the median of the three heights.
- For the middle man to have a height greater than 183 cm, at least two of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183 cm.

### Team 2:
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.
- The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability that the middle man in a group of three is taller than 183 cm.

### Comparison:
- The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is less than the probability that at least two out of three randomly selected men are taller than 183 cm.
- Therefore, Team 1 is more likely to count more days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm compared to Team 2.

### Conclusion:
Team 1 recorded more such days.
