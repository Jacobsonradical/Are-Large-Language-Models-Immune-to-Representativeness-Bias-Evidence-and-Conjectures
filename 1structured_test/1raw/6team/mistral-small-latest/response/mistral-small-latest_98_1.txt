This is an interesting problem that involves statistical reasoning and the understanding of distributions.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Since the heights are symmetrically distributed around the mean, we expect that the number of men taller than 183 cm (which is 5 cm above the mean) will be less than those between the mean and 183 cm.

### Team 1 Analysis:
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
- They rank these three men and count the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

### Team 2 Analysis:
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- They count the number of days when the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm.

To determine which team is likely to count more such days, we need to consider the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm.

### Probability Calculations:
- Let \( X \) be the height of a randomly chosen man from the population.
- Since the heights are symmetrically distributed around the mean 178 cm, the probability that \( X > 183 \) cm is less than the probability that \( X \) is between 178 cm and 183 cm.

### Team 1:
- On any given day, the probability that the middle man (out of three) is taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability for a single man being taller than 183 cm because the middle man's height must compete with the heights of the other two men.
- Hence, the number of days Team 1 records where the middle man is taller than 183 cm will likely be lower.

### Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 has a fixed probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm.
- Over 365 days, this probability will average out to a consistent count of days.

### Conclusion:
Team 2 is likely to record more days where the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1, which is counting days based on the height of the middle man out of three.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
