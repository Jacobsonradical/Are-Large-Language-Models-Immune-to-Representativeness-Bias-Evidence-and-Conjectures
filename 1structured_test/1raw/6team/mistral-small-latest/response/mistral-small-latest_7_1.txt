To determine which team counted more days with a height above 183 cm, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Distribution of Heights**: Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below average, we can infer that the distribution of heights is symmetric around 178 cm.

2. **Probability of Height Above 183 cm**: To find out the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm, we note that 183 cm is 5 cm above the average height of 178 cm. Since the distribution is symmetric, the probability that a man is taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability that he is shorter than 173 cm (which is 5 cm below the average).

3. **Team 1 Analysis**: Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, the two men shorter than him must be below 183 cm. Since the probability of a man being shorter than 183 cm is the same as being taller than 183 cm, the probability that all three men are shorter than 183 cm is \(0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.125\). Therefore, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is \(1 - 0.125 = 0.875\) or 87.5%.

4. **Team 2 Analysis**: Team 2 surveys one man each day. The probability that this man is taller than 183 cm is directly given by the distribution of heights, which we know to be 50%.

5. **Comparison**: Team 1 has a higher probability of recording a day with a height above 183 cm compared to Team 2 (87.5% vs. 50%).

Considering the probabilities, Team 1 is likely to record more days with a height above 183 cm than Team 2.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 1}
