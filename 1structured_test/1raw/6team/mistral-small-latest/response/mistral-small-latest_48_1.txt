Given the problem's details, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Population Distribution**:
   - The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
   - There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

2. **Team 1's Survey**:
   - Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
   - They rank these three men by height and count the days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

3. **Team 2's Survey**:
   - Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
   - They count the days where this man's height is more than 183 cm.

To determine which team might record more days where the height is more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights and the probability of selecting men taller than 183 cm.

### Height Distribution Insight:
- Since the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric around this average, there are as many men above 178 cm as below 178 cm.
- Given the symmetric distribution and the high average, a significant portion of the population likely has heights above 178 cm.

### Team 1's Outcome:
- For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least one of the other two men must be shorter, given the symmetric distribution and the average height.
- The probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm involves selecting three men such that one is above 183 cm and the others are below or equal to this height.

### Team 2's Outcome:
- Team 2 simply checks if the single man they survey is taller than 183 cm.
- The probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of men in the population with heights above 183 cm.

### Comparison:
- Given the symmetry and the average height, the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is likely substantial.
- Team 1 will have a lower probability of selecting three men where the middle one is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2, which has a straightforward probability of selecting one man taller than 183 cm.

### Conclusion:
- Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the height is more than 183 cm because their selection criterion is simpler and directly depends on the proportion of tall men in the population.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
{team: 2}
```
