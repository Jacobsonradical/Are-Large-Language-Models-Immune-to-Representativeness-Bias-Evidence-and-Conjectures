{team: 2}

Explanation:
Since the average height is around 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean. This implies that the number of men with heights above 183 cm (which is significantly above the mean) is relatively small.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them. For the middle man to have a height greater than 183 cm, both the shortest and the tallest of the three men would likely need to be below 183 cm, which is less likely given the distribution.

Team 2 surveys one man each day. The probability that the height of this man is above 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of the population with heights above 183 cm. Since this proportion is relatively small but non-negligible, Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height is above 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 2 is expected to record more such days.
