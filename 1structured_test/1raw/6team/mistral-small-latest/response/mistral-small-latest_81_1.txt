{team: 3}

Explanation:
- Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below average, the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean.
- Team 1 surveys three men daily and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. The middle man's height will likely follow a normal distribution centered around the mean height.
- Team 2 surveys one man daily and counts the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm. This count will also follow the distribution of heights in the population.
- Given the symmetry of the height distribution and the fact that both teams are sampling from the same population, their results are likely to be similar.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the number of days counted by Team 1 and Team 2 will be about the same, within a 5% margin of error.
