{team: 3}

Explanation:
Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above as below this average, the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean. This symmetry implies that for any given height threshold above the mean, the probability of selecting a man taller than that threshold is the same for both teams.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. The middle man's height being above 183 cm is a less frequent event because it requires both of the other two men to be shorter than 183 cm, which is less likely given the symmetric distribution.

Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when that man's height is more than 183 cm. The probability of any single man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of the middle man in Team 1's survey being taller than 183 cm, but Team 2's counting method is simpler and directly measures this probability.

Given the symmetry and the nature of the distributions involved, both teams are likely to count approximately the same number of days where the height exceeds 183 cm, making their counts about the same (within 5% of each other).
