To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed individuals was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the methodology of each team's survey.

Given that the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men above this average as there are below, we can infer that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean. This implies that approximately half of the population has a height above 178 cm and half has a height below 178 cm.

**Team 1:**
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
- They rank these three men and count the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

**Team 2:**
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- They count the days when the height of the surveyed man is more than 183 cm.

To determine which team recorded more such days, consider the following:

1. **Team 1:**
   - For the middle man to be above 183 cm, at least two of the three surveyed men must be taller than 183 cm (since the middle man is ranked second in height among the three).
   - The probability that any given man is taller than 183 cm is less than the probability that he is taller than the median (178 cm).

2. **Team 2:**
   - Each day, Team 2 simply needs any one man to be taller than 183 cm.
   - The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of men in the population taller than 183 cm.

Given the symmetry of the height distribution and the fact that the probability of an individual being taller than 183 cm is likely less than 50%, Team 2, which surveys one man per day, has a higher chance of recording more days where the man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1, which requires at least two out of three men to be taller than 183 cm for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, I believe Team 2 recorded more such days.
