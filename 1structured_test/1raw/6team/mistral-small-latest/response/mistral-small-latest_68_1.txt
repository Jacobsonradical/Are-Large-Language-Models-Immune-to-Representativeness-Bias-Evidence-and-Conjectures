To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed men was more than 183 cm, we need to analyze the data collection methods and distributions.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.
Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days on which the manâ€™s height is more than 183 cm.

### Analysis:

1. **Height Distribution**:
   - The height distribution is symmetric around the mean (178 cm).
   - Since there are as many men above the average height as there are below, the distribution of heights is balanced.

2. **Team 1**:
   - Each day, Team 1 surveys three men.
   - To find the probability that the middle man (out of three) is taller than 183 cm, we need to consider the order statistics of three men.
   - The middle man's height will be the median of the three heights.

3. **Team 2**:
   - Each day, Team 2 surveys one man.
   - The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is the same every day.

### Probability Calculation:

- **Team 1**:
  - The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is \( P(X > 183) \).
  - Assuming a normal distribution of heights, we can standardize the height to a Z-score:
    \[
    Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{183 - 178}{\sigma}
    \]
  - Using the standard normal table, we find the probability \( P(Z > \frac{183 - 178}{\sigma}) \).
  - Since we don't have the standard deviation (\(\sigma\)), we'll assume that \( \sigma \) is such that \( P(X > 183) \) is about 0.16 (for demonstration purposes).

  - The probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm involves more complex calculations, but intuitively, it should be less than \( P(X > 183) \) because the middle value is influenced by the other two values.

- **Team 2**:
  - The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is directly \( P(X > 183) \approx 0.16 \).

### Conclusion:
Given the above, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm because each day's probability is directly \( P(X > 183) \), while Team 1's probability is influenced by the other two heights.

Therefore, the answer is:

```
{team: 2}
