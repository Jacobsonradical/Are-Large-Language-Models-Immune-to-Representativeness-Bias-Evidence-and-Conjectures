{team: 2}

Explanation:
Team 2 surveys one man each day, and the probability of that man being taller than 183 cm is 50% (since the population is symmetric around the average height of 178 cm and there are as many men above as below this average). Therefore, Team 2 can expect to count around 182.5 days (50% of 365 days) where the height of the man is more than 183 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two of the three men must be taller than 183 cm. The probability of this happening is less than the 50% probability for Team 2, because it requires more men to be taller than 183 cm on any given day. Therefore, Team 1 is likely to count fewer days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2. Thus, Team 2 is expected to have counted more such days.
