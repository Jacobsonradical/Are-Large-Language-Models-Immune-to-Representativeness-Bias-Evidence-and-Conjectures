Given the symmetry in the distribution of heights around the average, we can expect that the number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm is roughly equal. This implies that the number of men with heights above 183 cm is likely less than those between 178 cm and 183 cm.

For Team 1, which surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is lower compared to the overall population. This is because the middle man's height has to be greater than the heights of two other men, one of which is likely to be close to or above average.

For Team 2, which surveys one man each day and counts the days when that man is taller than 183 cm, the probability is directly reflective of the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm.
