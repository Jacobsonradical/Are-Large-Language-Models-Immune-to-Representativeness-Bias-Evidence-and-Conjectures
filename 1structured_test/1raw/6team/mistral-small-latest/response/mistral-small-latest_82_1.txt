{team: 2}

Explanation:
Team 2 is surveying one man each day and counting the days on which the man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above as below the average, the distribution of men's heights is symmetric around the average. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is likely to be less than 0.5 (since 183 cm is significantly above the average height of 178 cm).

Team 1, on the other hand, is surveying three men each day and counting the days on which the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. The middle man's height is likely to be closer to the average height, given that there are as many men above as below the average. Therefore, the probability that the middle man's height is more than 183 cm is likely to be even lower than the probability for a single randomly selected man.

Thus, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the man's height is more than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
