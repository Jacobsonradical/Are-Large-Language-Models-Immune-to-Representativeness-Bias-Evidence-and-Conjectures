To determine which team recorded more days where the height of the surveyed individual(s) exceeded 183 cm, we need to analyze the sampling methods and the distribution of heights in the population.

### Given Information:
1. The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
2. There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
3. Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
4. Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days where the man's height is more than 183 cm.

### Analysis:

#### Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
- The middle man's height is compared to 183 cm.
- If the population is symmetric around the mean, the middle man in a random sample of three is likely to be closer to the mean (178 cm).
- Therefore, the probability that the middle man's height exceeds 183 cm is relatively low.

#### Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- The probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of men in the population with height greater than 183 cm.

### Symmetric Distribution:
Given that there are as many men above the average height as below, the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean. This implies that half the population has heights greater than 178 cm and half has heights less than 178 cm.

### Probability Calculation:
- Let \( p \) be the probability that a randomly chosen man has a height greater than 183 cm.
- Team 2 will count days based on \( p \).
- Team 1 will count days based on a lower probability because the middle man is likely to be around the mean.

### Conclusion:
Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height of the surveyed man exceeds 183 cm.

Thus, the answer is:
```
{team: 2}
