To determine which team recorded more days where the height criterion was met, let's analyze the situation for both teams.

### Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men above the average height as below it.
- Team 1 counts the number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Given the symmetry in the height distribution:
- 50% of men are taller than 178 cm.
- 25% of men are taller than 183 cm (since 183 cm is 5 cm above the average).

When three men are chosen randomly:
- The probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm involves considering all possible orderings of three men's heights.
- The middle man being taller than 183 cm is less likely than any one man being taller than 183 cm because the middle man's position depends on the heights of the other two men.

### Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- Team 2 counts the number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Given the same population:
- 25% of the time, the man surveyed will be taller than 183 cm.

### Comparison:
- For Team 2, 25% of the 365 days will have a man taller than 183 cm, which is \(0.25 \times 365 \approx 91.25\) days.
- For Team 1, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm in a group of three is lower than 25% because the middle man's height depends on the other two.

### Conclusion:
Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height criterion is met.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 2}
