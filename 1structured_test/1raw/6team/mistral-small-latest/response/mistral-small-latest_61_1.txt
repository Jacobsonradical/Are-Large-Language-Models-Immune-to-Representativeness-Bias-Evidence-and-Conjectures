{team: 1}

Explanation:
Team 1 is more likely to record more days with the middle man's height more than 183 cm because they are surveying three men each day and ranking them. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below this average, it's likely that the middle man's height will be closer to the average. However, since the middle man's height needs to be more than 183 cm, which is significantly above the average, this is less likely to happen frequently. Team 2, on the other hand, is surveying only one man each day, so even if the man is slightly above the average, he could be counted if his height is more than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 1 is more likely to have a lower count of such days compared to Team 2.
