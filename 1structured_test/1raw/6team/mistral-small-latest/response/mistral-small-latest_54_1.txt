To address this question, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and how the sampling methods used by the two teams might affect the results.

Given that the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can infer that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean.

**Team 1:**
- Surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- Counts the days when the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

**Team 2:**
- Surveys one man each day.
- Counts the days when the height of the man is more than 183 cm.

To determine which team is likely to count more such days, let's analyze the scenarios:

1. **Team 1:**
   - For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least one of the other two men must be shorter than 183 cm, because the middle man's height is between the heights of the other two men.
   - Given the symmetric distribution, there is a significant probability that at least one of the three men surveyed each day will be taller than 183 cm. However, the condition that the middle man must be taller than 183 cm is more stringent than simply finding any man taller than 183 cm.

2. **Team 2:**
   - Simply needs to find one man taller than 183 cm each day.
   - This is a less restrictive condition compared to Team 1, as any man surveyed taller than 183 cm will count.

Given the symmetric distribution and the less restrictive condition for Team 2, it is likely that Team 2 will count more days where a man is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
{team: 2}
