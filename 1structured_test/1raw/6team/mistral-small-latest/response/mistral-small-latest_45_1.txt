The problem involves comparing the number of days that each of the two teams records a height greater than 183 cm.

### Team 1:
- **Method**: Each day, Team 1 surveys three men and ranks them by height.
- **Condition**: They count the days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- **Analysis**:
  - The average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below.
  - This symmetry means that half the men are taller than 178 cm.
  - Since the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm, it implies that both the tallest and the second tallest men in the group of three are taller than 183 cm.
  - The probability that the middle man (second tallest) is taller than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights.

### Team 2:
- **Method**: Each day, Team 2 surveys one man.
- **Condition**: They count the days where the man's height is more than 183 cm.
- **Analysis**:
  - The probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm can be estimated from the distribution of heights.
  - If we assume a normal distribution of heights centered around 178 cm with a certain standard deviation, we can estimate the proportion of men taller than 183 cm.
  - Given the symmetry and the average height, a reasonable assumption is that about half the men are taller than 178 cm, and fewer would be taller than 183 cm.

### Comparison:
- **Team 1** is likely to record fewer days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm because:
  - The middle man's height must be between the tallest and the shortest of the three men.
  - The requirement for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm is more stringent than just one man being taller than 183 cm.

- **Team 2** is likely to record more days where the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm because:
  - Any man surveyed can have a height greater than 183 cm without the additional constraints imposed by comparing with other men.

### Conclusion:
Based on the described conditions and the reasoning above, **Team 2** is likely to record more days where the height is greater than 183 cm.
