To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed individuals was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the methodology of each team's survey.

Given that the average height of men is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as there are below, the height distribution is symmetric around the mean. This implies that the heights of men are evenly distributed above and below 178 cm.

**Team 1:**
Each day, Team 1 surveys three men and ranks them by height. For the middle man to have a height greater than 183 cm, at least one of the other two men must have a height â‰¤ 178 cm because the two extremes (shortest and tallest of the three) are likely to be around the mean or below it.

**Team 2:**
Each day, Team 2 surveys one man. The probability that this man has a height greater than 183 cm is the same as the probability that any randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm.

Since the distribution is symmetric and there are as many men above the average height as below, the proportion of men with heights greater than 183 cm will be less than 50% but greater than 0%.

To simplify the comparison:
- Team 1 is essentially looking for pairs of men (out of three) where at least one is below the average height and the middle one is above 183 cm.
- Team 2 is simply looking for any one man with a height above 183 cm.

Given the symmetric distribution and the requirement for Team 1 to find specific configurations of heights, it is likely that Team 2 will count more days with men taller than 183 cm because their criterion is less strict.

Therefore, I conclude that:

```
{team: 2}
