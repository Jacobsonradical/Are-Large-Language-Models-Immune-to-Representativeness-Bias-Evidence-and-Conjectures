To determine which team is likely to have counted more days with men taller than 183 cm, let's analyze the situation step by step.

**Team 1:**
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
- They rank these men based on their height and count the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm.
- Given the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric around the average, the middle man's height will likely be close to the average.
- Therefore, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is relatively low, as 183 cm is significantly above the average height.

**Team 2:**
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- They count the days when this man is taller than 183 cm.
- Since there are as many men above the average height as there are below, the probability of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of being shorter than 173 cm (which is 5 cm below the average).
- This probability is not zero but is likely lower than the probability of being within a range close to the average.

Given these considerations:
- Team 1 is less likely to have the middle man (who is likely around the average height) be taller than 183 cm.
- Team 2 has a non-zero but relatively low probability of any random man being taller than 183 cm.

However, Team 2 surveys only one man per day, whereas Team 1 surveys three men per day. The probability for Team 1 might be lower on any given day, but they have more opportunities (three times as many) to encounter a man taller than 183 cm.

Considering the symmetry and the fact that both teams operate over the same period of 365 days, it is plausible that the number of days counted by both teams could be within 5% of each other.

**Conclusion:**
{team: 3}

Both teams are likely to have counted about the same number of days, within 5% of each other.
