To solve this problem, we need to compare the probabilities of each team recording a day where the height of a man meets the specified criterion (more than 183 cm).

### Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
- The average height of men is 178 cm, and the heights are symmetrically distributed around the average.
- The team counts the days where the height of the middle man (in terms of height among the three surveyed) is more than 183 cm.

Let's denote the heights of the three men surveyed on a given day as \( h_1 \), \( h_2 \), and \( h_3 \), where \( h_1 \leq h_2 \leq h_3 \).

For the middle man's height \( h_2 \) to be more than 183 cm, both \( h_1 \) and \( h_3 \) must be at least 183 cm because \( h_2 \) is in the middle.

The probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm is \( p \). Given the symmetry around the average height of 178 cm, we can estimate \( p \) to be approximately 0.5 (since there are as many men above as below the average).

The probability that all three men have heights greater than 183 cm is \( p^3 \).

\[ p^3 = 0.5^3 = 0.125 \]

So, the probability that Team 1 records a day where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm is 0.125.

### Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- The team counts the days where the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm.

The probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm is \( p \).

\[ p = 0.5 \]

So, the probability that Team 2 records a day where the man's height is more than 183 cm is 0.5.

### Comparison:
- Team 1: Probability = 0.125
- Team 2: Probability = 0.5

Clearly, Team 2 has a much higher probability of recording such days compared to Team 1.

### Conclusion:
Team 2 recorded more such days.
