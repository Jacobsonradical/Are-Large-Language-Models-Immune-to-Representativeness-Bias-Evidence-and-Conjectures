Based on the given information, let's analyze the situation for both teams:

1. **Team 1:**
   - Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
   - The height of the middle man exceeding 183 cm is the event of interest.
   - Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above as below the average, the distribution of heights is symmetric around 178 cm.
   - For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, both other men surveyed that day must be shorter than or equal to 183 cm.
   - The probability of any individual man being taller than 183 cm is likely less than 50% because 183 cm is significantly above the average height of 178 cm.

2. **Team 2:**
   - Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
   - The event of interest is the man being taller than 183 cm.
   - The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm on any given day is the same as the fraction of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

Given the symmetric distribution around the average, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is likely less than 50%. However, the probability that the middle man in a group of three is taller than 183 cm is even lower because both other men must be shorter.

Therefore, Team 2, which simply surveys one man per day, is more likely to record more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1, which surveys three men per day and has a stricter condition for the middle man's height.

So, the answer is:

{team: 2}
