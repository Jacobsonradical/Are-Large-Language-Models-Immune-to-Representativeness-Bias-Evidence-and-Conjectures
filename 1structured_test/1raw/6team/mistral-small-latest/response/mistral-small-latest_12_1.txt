To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed individual(s) was more than 183 cm, let's analyze the problem step-by-step.

### Team 1 Analysis:
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- The average height of the men is 178 cm, and the distribution is symmetric around the average, meaning half the men are taller and half are shorter than 178 cm.
- The team counts the days when the middle man (in height) among the three surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Given the symmetric distribution of heights, the middle man's height on any given day is likely to be around the average or slightly above, but not significantly higher unless the three selected men are all from the taller half of the distribution.

### Team 2 Analysis:
- Team 2 surveys one man each day.
- The team counts the days when this man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since half the men are taller than 178 cm, and assuming a normal distribution of heights, a significant portion of these men will be taller than 183 cm.

### Comparison:
- For Team 1, the middle man being taller than 183 cm is a less frequent event because it requires all three men surveyed to be from the taller half of the distribution, which is less likely.
- For Team 2, any single man being taller than 183 cm is more likely since 50% of the men are taller than the average, and a substantial number will be taller than 183 cm.

### Conclusion:
Team 2 is likely to count more days where the height of the surveyed man exceeds 183 cm because each day's survey is an independent event with a higher probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
{team: 2}
