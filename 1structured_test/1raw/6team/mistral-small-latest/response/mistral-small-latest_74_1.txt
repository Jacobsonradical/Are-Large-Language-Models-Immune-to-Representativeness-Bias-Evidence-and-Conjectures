Given the information, let's break down the situation for each team:

1. **Team 1**:
   - Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
   - The average height of men is 178 cm, and the distribution is symmetric around the average, meaning as many men are above 178 cm as below it.
   - We are interested in the days where the middle man (in terms of height) is taller than 183 cm.

2. **Team 2**:
   - Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
   - We are interested in the days where the height of the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.

To determine which team is likely to record more days where the height surpasses 183 cm, consider the following:

- **Team 1**: For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, both the shortest and the tallest of the three men surveyed must be shorter than or equal to 183 cm. Given the symmetric distribution, it is less likely that all three men fall into this narrow range of heights.

- **Team 2**: Any single man surveyed who is taller than 183 cm will count towards their total. Since the distribution is symmetric and there are as many men above the average as below, a significant portion of the population will be above 183 cm.

Given these conditions, **Team 2** is more likely to record more days where the height of the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.

Thus, the answer is:
{team: 2}
