To determine which team recorded more days, we need to consider the distributions of heights in the population and the sampling methods of each team.

Given that the average height of men is 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can infer that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean of 178 cm.

### Team 1:
Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them. The middle man's height being more than 183 cm implies that both the tallest and the second tallest men are also taller than 183 cm on that day.

- For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, both the tallest and the second tallest men must also be taller than 183 cm.
- The probability of any one man being taller than 183 cm is \( P(X > 183) \).
- The probability that all three men are taller than 183 cm is \( P(X_1 > 183, X_2 > 183, X_3 > 183) \), which is \( (P(X > 183))^3 \).

### Team 2:
Team 2 surveys one man each day. The height of the man being more than 183 cm simply requires the probability \( P(X > 183) \).

### Comparison:
- The probability \( P(X > 183) \) is the same for both teams.
- However, Team 1's condition is more stringent because it requires all three men to be taller than 183 cm.
- The probability of selecting three men all taller than 183 cm in one day is much lower than the probability of selecting one man taller than 183 cm in one day.

Therefore, Team 1 is likely to record fewer days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm compared to Team 2 recording days where the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm.

So, the answer is:
```
{team: 2}
