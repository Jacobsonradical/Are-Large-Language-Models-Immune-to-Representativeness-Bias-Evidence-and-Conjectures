To determine which team recorded more days where the height of the surveyed men met the criteria, let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Team 1 Analysis

- **Daily Survey:** Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- **Criteria:** The height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Given that the average height is 178 cm and the distribution of heights is symmetric around this average, we can infer that the heights are normally distributed. This implies that the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is the same as a man being shorter than 173 cm (since 183 - 178 = 178 - 173 = 5 cm).

For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, the tallest man must also be taller than 183 cm because the middle man is sandwiched between the shortest and tallest men.

- **Probability Calculation:**
  - The probability that the tallest man is taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability that the shortest man is shorter than 173 cm.
  - Since the heights are symmetrically distributed, the probability for each is 0.5.
  - Therefore, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is 0.5 (since it depends on both the tallest and shortest being in their respective ranges).

### Team 2 Analysis

- **Daily Survey:** Team 2 surveys one man each day.
- **Criteria:** The height of the man is more than 183 cm.

The probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability that he is shorter than 173 cm, which is 0.5 due to the symmetric distribution around the mean.

### Comparison

- **Team 1:** The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is 0.5.
- **Team 2:** The probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is 0.5.

Both teams have the same probability of 0.5 for their respective criteria each day. Therefore, over 365 days, both teams would expect to record approximately the same number of days meeting their criteria.

### Conclusion

Given the symmetry in the distribution and the equal probabilities, we can expect that the number of days recorded by both teams will be about the same (within 5% of each other).

Thus, the answer is:

```
{team: 3}
```
