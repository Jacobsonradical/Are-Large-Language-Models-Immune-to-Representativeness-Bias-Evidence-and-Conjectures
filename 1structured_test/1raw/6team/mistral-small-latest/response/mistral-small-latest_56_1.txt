To determine which team counted more days where the surveyed individuals' heights exceeded 183 cm, let's analyze the situation for each team.

### Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men above the average height as there are below the average height.

Given the symmetry around the average height, half the population is taller than 178 cm and half is shorter. Since the heights are normally distributed, the likelihood of picking men whose heights are significantly above the average (e.g., above 183 cm) decreases as the height threshold increases.

To find the probability of the middle man (out of three) being taller than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights and the ranking within the group of three men surveyed each day. However, since the heights are symmetrically distributed around the mean and we're looking for men taller than 183 cm, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is relatively low.

### Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- The probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm can be estimated based on the distribution of heights.

Given the average height is 178 cm and assuming a normal distribution, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm can be calculated using the properties of the normal distribution. The probability that a man is taller than 183 cm (5 cm above the mean) can be approximated using the standard normal distribution tables or a calculator.

For a standard normal distribution \( N(0,1) \):
- \( \mu = 178 \) cm, \( \sigma \) (standard deviation) is not given but can be inferred from the problem context.
- The z-score for 183 cm is \( z = \frac{183 - 178}{\sigma} \).

Assuming \( \sigma \) is approximately 5 cm (for simplicity and without loss of generality):
- \( z = \frac{183 - 178}{5} = 1 \).

The probability that a man is taller than 183 cm is approximately \( P(Z > 1) \approx 0.1587 \) (from standard normal tables).

### Comparison:
- Team 1 is less likely to have the middle man exceed 183 cm consistently over 365 days compared to Team 2.
- Team 2 has a straightforward probability of 0.1587 each day to exceed 183 cm.

Given these considerations, Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the surveyed man's height exceeds 183 cm.

### Conclusion:
