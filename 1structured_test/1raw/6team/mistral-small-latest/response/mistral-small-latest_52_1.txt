To determine which team counted more days where the height of the man surveyed exceeded 183 cm, we need to analyze the procedures and expectations for both teams.

**Team 1:**
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
- They rank these three men by height and count the days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

**Team 2:**
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- They count the days where the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm.

Given that the average height of men is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below it, the distribution of heights is symmetric around 178 cm.

**Team 1 Analysis:**
- For the middle man to have a height greater than 183 cm, at least one of the other two men must have a height less than or equal to 183 cm.
- Since the heights are symmetrically distributed around the mean, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is influenced by the likelihood that the other two men are shorter or equal to 183 cm.

**Team 2 Analysis:**
- For Team 2, the requirement is simpler: any man surveyed on a given day must be taller than 183 cm.
- Given the symmetric distribution, approximately half the population is taller than 183 cm (since 183 cm is more than one standard deviation above the mean if we assume a normal distribution).

**Comparison:**
- Team 2's single-man survey has a straightforward probability calculation: roughly 50% of the days should result in a man taller than 183 cm, given the symmetric distribution.
- Team 1's requirement for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm is less likely because it involves ranking within a small group and depends on the heights of the other two men surveyed the same day.

Considering these points, Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
{team: 2}
