To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed individuals exceeded 183 cm, let's analyze the situation for each team.

### Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
- They rank these three men by height and count the days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Given that the average height is 178 cm and the distribution of heights is symmetric around the average, the middle man's height will typically be close to the average.

### Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- They count the days where this man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Since the distribution is symmetric, approximately half of the population will have heights above 183 cm.

### Analysis:
1. **Team 1**:
   - The middle man's height being more than 183 cm implies that both the shortest and the tallest of the three surveyed men are below 183 cm.
   - This is a less common scenario because it requires both of these conditions to be met simultaneously.

2. **Team 2**:
   - Surveying one man randomly means that with approximately 50% probability, the height will be above 183 cm (given the symmetric distribution).

### Conclusion:
- Team 2 is likely to count more days where the height is more than 183 cm because they are simply checking if one randomly chosen man exceeds this height, which happens with a higher probability (50%).
- Team 1 has a lower probability of the middle man being above 183 cm because it requires specific conditions to be met for all three men surveyed.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 2}
