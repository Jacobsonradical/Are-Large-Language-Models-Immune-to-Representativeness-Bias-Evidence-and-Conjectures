{team: 3}

Explanation:
Given that the heights of men are symmetrically distributed around the average of 178 cm, and that there are as many men above the average height as there are below it, we can infer that the distribution of heights is roughly normal. This means that the majority of men will have heights close to the average, with fewer men having heights significantly above or below the average.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm. Since 183 cm is significantly above the average height of 178 cm, the middle man's height being above 183 cm is a rare event. However, since Team 1 is always comparing three men, the probability of one of them being significantly taller than the average is higher than for a single man.

Team 2 surveys only one man each day and counts the days when the height of that man is more than 183 cm. Since 183 cm is significantly above the average, the probability of any given man being taller than 183 cm is relatively low.

Considering the symmetry of the height distribution and the fact that both teams are surveying from the same population, it is reasonable to expect that the number of days Team 1 counts a middle man taller than 183 cm will be approximately the same as the number of days Team 2 counts a man taller than 183 cm. Therefore, within a 5% margin of error, we can expect the counts from both teams to be about the same.
