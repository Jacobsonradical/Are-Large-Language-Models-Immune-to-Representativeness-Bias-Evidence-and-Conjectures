{team: 2}

Explanation:

Team 2 is surveying one man each day and counting the days the man is taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and the distribution is symmetric (equal number of men above and below average), we can assume that approximately 50% of the population is taller than 183 cm. Therefore, on average, Team 2 should count about 50% of 365 days, which is around 182.5 days.

For Team 1, they are surveying three men each day and counting the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. The middle man's height is less likely to be in the extremes (either very short or very tall) because they are ranked in the middle. Therefore, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is less than 50%. As a result, Team 1 is likely to count fewer days than Team 2 where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm.
