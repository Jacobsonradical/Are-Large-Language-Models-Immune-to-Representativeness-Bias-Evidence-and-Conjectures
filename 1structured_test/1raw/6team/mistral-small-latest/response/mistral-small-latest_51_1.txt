{team: 2}

Explanation:

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them. The middle man's height being more than 183 cm suggests that both the tallest man and the middle man are taller than 183 cm. Given that the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric around the average, the probability that a man is taller than 183 cm is relatively low. Thus, the probability that both the tallest and the middle man are taller than 183 cm on the same day is even lower.

Team 2 surveys one man each day, and the condition is simply that the man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the distribution of heights is symmetric around the average, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability calculated for Team 1.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to record more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm.
