To address this question, we need to understand the distribution of heights in the population and how the sampling methods of the two teams affect the counts of heights above 183 cm.

Given:
- The average height of men is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men above the average height as there are below the average height.

This suggests a symmetric distribution around the mean. Since the average is 178 cm, the distribution of heights is symmetric about 178 cm.

### Team 1 Analysis:
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- They count the number of days on which the middle (second-tallest) man is taller than 183 cm.

For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, both the tallest and the shortest men in the sample of three must be below or at 183 cm. Given the symmetric distribution and the fact that the average height is 178 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man being above 183 cm is lower than being below 183 cm.

### Team 2 Analysis:
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days on which the height is above 183 cm.
- The probability that a randomly selected man is above 183 cm can be directly calculated from the distribution.

### Comparison:
- For Team 1, the event of the middle man being above 183 cm depends on the heights of all three men surveyed.
- For Team 2, the event is directly tied to the height of a single man.

Given the symmetric distribution and the fact that the average height is 178 cm, the probability that a randomly selected man is above 183 cm is less than 50%. This means the probability that the middle man in Team 1's sample is above 183 cm is even lower due to the dependency on the heights of the other two men.

### Conclusion:
Team 2 is likely to count more days where the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm because they are not constrained by the heights of other men in the sample.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
{team: 2}
