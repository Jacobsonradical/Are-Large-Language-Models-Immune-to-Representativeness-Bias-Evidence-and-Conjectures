To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and think through the probabilities involved.

1. **Team 1 Analysis:**
   - Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly from the population.
   - The average height of men is 178 cm, and the distribution is symmetric around this average.
   - The team counts the days when the height of the middle man (second tallest of the three) is more than 183 cm.

   To find the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm:
   - Since the distribution is symmetric and there are as many men above the average as below, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5 (because 183 cm is above the average height of 178 cm).
   - The exact probability will depend on the specific distribution of heights, but it will be less than 0.5.

   When three men are chosen, the middle man's height being above 183 cm is a less likely event compared to a single man being above 183 cm.

2. **Team 2 Analysis:**
   - Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly from the population.
   - The team counts the days when the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm.

   The probability that a single man is taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability calculated for Team 1, which is less than 0.5.

Now, comparing the two teams:
- Team 1 has a lower probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm on any given day because it depends on the height of three men.
- Team 2 has a straightforward probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm, which is less than 0.5.

Given that Team 1's condition (middle man taller than 183 cm) is less likely than Team 2's condition (any man taller than 183 cm), it is likely that Team 2 will count more days where the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Based on this analysis, I would answer:

```
{team: 2}
