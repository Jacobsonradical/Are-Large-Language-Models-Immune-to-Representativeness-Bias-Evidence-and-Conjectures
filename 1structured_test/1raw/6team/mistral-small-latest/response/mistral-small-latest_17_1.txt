{team: 2}

Explanation:
Team 2 is surveying one man each day and counting the days when the man's height exceeds 183 cm. Given the symmetric distribution of heights around the mean of 178 cm, approximately 50% of the population will have heights below 178 cm, and 50% will have heights above 178 cm. The height distribution above 178 cm will follow a normal distribution, with the majority of men clustered around the mean and a smaller number of men at the extremes (above 183 cm).

Team 1, on the other hand, is surveying three men each day and counting the days when the middle man's height exceeds 183 cm. The middle man in a random sample of three is less likely to be at the extreme ends of the distribution compared to a single random individual. Therefore, Team 1 is less likely to count a day where the middle man's height exceeds 183 cm compared to Team 2, which is counting any man exceeding 183 cm.

So, Team 2 is more likely to record more such days.
