{team: 2}

Explanation:

Team 2 surveys one man each day, so the probability of that man being taller than 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of men in the population taller than 183 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. Since the heights are symmetrically distributed around the average of 178 cm, the middle man's height will tend to be closer to the average than to the extremes. Therefore, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is likely lower than the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm.

Thus, Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm.
