{team: 2}

Explanation:

Given that the average height is 178 cm and there is symmetry in the distribution of heights above and below the average, we can infer that the distribution of heights is symmetric around 178 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. The middle man's height being more than 183 cm implies that both the tallest and the shortest of the three men are likely to have heights closer to or below the average. Since the distribution is symmetric, the likelihood of selecting a man taller than 183 cm as the middle man is less than the likelihood of selecting a man taller than 183 cm in a single-person survey.

Team 2 surveys one man each day and simply checks if his height is more than 183 cm. This direct method will likely yield more days with a man taller than 183 cm because it does not rely on the relative ranking among a group of three men.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to record more such days.
