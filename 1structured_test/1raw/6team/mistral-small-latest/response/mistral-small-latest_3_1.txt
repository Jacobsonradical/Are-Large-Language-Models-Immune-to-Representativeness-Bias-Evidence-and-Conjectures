To determine which team counted more days where the height observed or ranked was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the sampling methods of the two teams.

Given:
- The average height of men is 178 cm.
- The population is symmetric around the average, meaning there are as many men above the average height as below it.

Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men and ranks them by height.
- They count the number of days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man.
- They count the number of days where the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the population is symmetric about the average height, and the average is 178 cm, the distribution of heights above and below 178 cm is mirrored. However, the height of 183 cm is significantly above the average and likely represents a smaller subset of the population.

For Team 1:
- When selecting three men randomly each day, the middle man's height will generally be closer to the average height due to the properties of order statistics.
- The likelihood of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is lower compared to an individual man being taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they are directly observing one man, and if that man happens to be taller than 183 cm, they count that day.
- The probability of any given man being taller than 183 cm is the same each day, and over the course of 365 days, this should reflect the proportion of men in the population taller than 183 cm.

Considering these points, Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height observed is more than 183 cm because they are not constrained by the ranking within a group of three men.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 2}
