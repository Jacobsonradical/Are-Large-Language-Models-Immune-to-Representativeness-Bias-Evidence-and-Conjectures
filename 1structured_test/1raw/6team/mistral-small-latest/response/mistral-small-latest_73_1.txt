Based on the given information, let's analyze the situation:

1. **Team 1**:
   - Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
   - The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
   - There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
   - The team ranks the three men and counts the days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

2. **Team 2**:
   - Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
   - The team counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Given the symmetry in the population (equal number of men above and below the average height), the distribution of heights can be considered normal or close to normal. This implies that the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm should be approximately equal to the probability of the middle man in a group of three randomly selected men being taller than 183 cm.

Since both teams are surveying from the same population with the same criteria for height, and given the symmetrical distribution, the expected outcomes for each team should be similar.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 3}
