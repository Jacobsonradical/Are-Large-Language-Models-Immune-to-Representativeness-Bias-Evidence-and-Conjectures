To determine which team recorded more days, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the methods used by each team to survey and count the heights.

Given that the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can infer that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean. This means that the heights are normally distributed with a mean of 178 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm. Since the heights are normally distributed, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is relatively low, as 183 cm is significantly above the average height.

Team 2 surveys only one man each day and counts the days on which the height of the man is taller than 183 cm. The probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm is also low but slightly higher than the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm in a group of three men.

Considering the distribution of heights and the methods used by each team, it is likely that Team 2 recorded more days with a man taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 2}
