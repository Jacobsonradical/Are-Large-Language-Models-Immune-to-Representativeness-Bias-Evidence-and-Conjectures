{team: 2}

Explanation:

Team 1 is surveying three men each day and is interested in the middle man's height. Given that the height distribution is symmetric around the average (178 cm), the middle man's height will tend to be close to the average. Therefore, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is relatively low because the average height is significantly below 183 cm.

Team 2 is surveying one man each day and is simply counting the days when that man's height is above 183 cm. Since the distribution is symmetric, there are an equal number of men above and below the average height. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability that the middle man from a group of three is taller than 183 cm.

Thus, Team 2, which is surveying one man per day, is likely to count more days where the height of the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
