{team: 2}

Explanation:

Team 1 is surveying three men each day and counting the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric around the average, the middle man's height will likely be close to the average on most days. Therefore, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is relatively low.

Team 2, on the other hand, is surveying one man each day and counting the days when that man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the distribution is symmetric, there are as many men above the average height as there are below. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm is equal to the probability that he is shorter than 173 cm, which is 0.5 (since the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric).

Given that Team 2 has a higher probability of counting a day where the man is taller than 183 cm, it is more likely that Team 2 will record more such days compared to Team 1.
