To determine which team counted more days where the height was more than 183 cm, we need to analyze the data collection methods and the given population statistics.

### Team 1 Analysis:
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm, with an equal number of men above and below this average.
- We need to determine the probability that the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

Given that the heights are symmetrically distributed around the mean:
- Half of the men are above 178 cm, and half are below.
- To be more than 183 cm, a man must be in the upper tail of the distribution.

If we assume a normal distribution for simplicity, the probability that a man is above 183 cm can be estimated using the standard normal distribution:
- The Z-score for 183 cm (if the mean is 178 cm and standard deviation is unknown but assumed to be typical for heights) would be approximately 1 (since 183 - 178 = 5, and a standard deviation for heights is often around 5-7 cm).
- The probability of a Z-score of 1 or greater is approximately 0.1587.

For three men:
- The probability that the middle man is above 183 cm while the other two are below or equal to 183 cm is much lower, as it requires specific ordering.

### Team 2 Analysis:
- Team 2 surveys one man each day.
- The probability that this man is taller than 183 cm is directly 0.1587, as calculated above.

### Comparison:
- Team 1 has a much lower probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm due to the specific ranking requirement.
- Team 2 has a straightforward probability of 0.1587 for any given day.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the height is more than 183 cm.

### Conclusion:
```plaintext
{team: 2}
