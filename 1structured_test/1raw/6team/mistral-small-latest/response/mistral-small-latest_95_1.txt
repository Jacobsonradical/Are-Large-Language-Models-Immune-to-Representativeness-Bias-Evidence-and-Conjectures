To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed individuals was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the method of surveying by each team.

Given:
- The average height of men is 178 cm.
- There are as many men above the average height as there are below.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days the man's height is more than 183 cm.

### Team 1 Analysis:
Team 1 surveys three men each day. To have the middle man's height more than 183 cm, at least two of the three men must have heights greater than 183 cm. Since the population is symmetric around the mean, the probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm is 50%.

The probability that at least two out of three men have a height greater than 183 cm can be calculated using the binomial distribution:
\[ P(\text{at least 2 out of 3}) = \binom{3}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \binom{3}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 3 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \]

So, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is approximately 50%. Therefore, Team 1 is likely to count about 182.5 days (half of 365 days) where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

### Team 2 Analysis:
Team 2 surveys one man each day. The probability that this man is taller than 183 cm is also 50%.

So, Team 2 is likely to count about 182.5 days (half of 365 days) where the man's height is more than 183 cm.

### Conclusion:
Both teams are likely to count approximately the same number of days (within 5% of each other). Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 3}
