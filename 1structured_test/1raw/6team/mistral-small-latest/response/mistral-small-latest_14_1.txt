{team: 2}

Explanation:

Team 1 is surveying three men each day and ranking them. To have the middle man's height more than 183 cm, at least two of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183 cm. Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below, it's likely that the number of men taller than 183 cm is relatively small compared to the total population. Therefore, the probability of selecting two or more men taller than 183 cm in a single day is low.

Team 2, on the other hand, is simply surveying one man each day. The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, there is a significant portion of the population that is taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the height of the surveyed man is more than 183 cm.
