To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed individuals was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the methodology of each team.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

This implies that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean. Assuming a normal distribution for simplicity, this means that the distribution of heights will be centered around 178 cm.

### Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
- They rank the three men by height and count the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

To have the middle man's height more than 183 cm, at least one of the other two men must have a height of at least 183 cm. Given the symmetric distribution around the mean, the probability that any single man is taller than 183 cm is less than 50% because 183 cm is significantly higher than the mean of 178 cm.

### Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- They count the days when the height of the man they surveyed is more than 183 cm.

The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is the same as for Team 1, less than 50%.

### Comparison:
- For Team 1, the condition for counting a day is stricter because it requires at least two out of three men to be shorter than 183 cm for the middle man to be shorter, which is a less common event than a single man being shorter.
- For Team 2, the condition is simply whether the single man surveyed is taller than 183 cm, which happens with the same probability as any single man being taller than 183 cm.

Given these considerations, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm because their condition is met more frequently than Team 1's condition.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 2}
