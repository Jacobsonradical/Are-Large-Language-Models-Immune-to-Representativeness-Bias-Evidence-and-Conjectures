To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed men was more than 183 cm, we need to analyze the sampling methods and the distribution of heights in the population.

Given:
- The average height of men is 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

This implies that the distribution of heights is symmetric around the average. Since the average is 178 cm, the median height is also 178 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. The middle man's height will likely be close to the median height (178 cm), but not necessarily above it. Since the distribution is symmetric, the middle man's height will be above 183 cm less frequently than a randomly chosen man's height.

Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the distribution is symmetric, the probability that a randomly chosen man's height is above 183 cm is the same as the probability that it is below 173 cm (183 - (183 - 178)).

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height of the man is more than 183 cm because they are surveying men one at a time and have a higher chance of selecting a man with a height above 183 cm.

Thus, the answer is:
{team: 2}
