To determine which team counted more days where the height of the man(s) surveyed was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the methodology of each team's survey.

Given:
- The average height of men is around 178 cm.
- The population is symmetric around the average, meaning there are as many men above the average height as there are below.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days where that man's height is more than 183 cm.

### Team 1 Analysis:
- When Team 1 surveys three men each day, they rank them by height.
- The middle man's height can vary, but given the symmetry of the distribution, the middle man's height is likely to be close to the average (178 cm).
- For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, both the shortest and the tallest men surveyed on that day would need to be taller than 183 cm.
- This is a more stringent condition, as it requires all three men to be above the average height and specifically above 183 cm.

### Team 2 Analysis:
- When Team 2 surveys one man each day, any man taller than 183 cm will be counted.
- Given the symmetric distribution, roughly 50% of the men are taller than the average height of 178 cm.
- A significant portion of these men will also be taller than 183 cm, but not necessarily 50%.

### Comparison:
- Team 1's condition for counting a day is more restrictive (all three men above 183 cm), making it less likely to count such days compared to Team 2.
- Team 2 simply needs one man above 183 cm, which is a more frequent occurrence.

### Conclusion:
Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
{team: 2}
