{team: 3}

Explanation:
Given that the average height of men is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below it, we can infer that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean. Additionally, the problem states that the heights of men above and below the average are equal, indicating that the distribution is uniform or nearly uniform within a reasonable range around the mean.

For Team 1, the focus is on the middle man in groups of three randomly selected men. Since the distribution of heights is symmetric, and given the large number of days (365), the likelihood of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm should be approximately the same as any other man's height being more than 183 cm.

For Team 2, the focus is simply on any man surveyed each day. Similar to Team 1, the probability that a man's height exceeds 183 cm is the same for each survey.

Therefore, both teams are likely to count a similar number of days where the height is more than 183 cm, within 5% of each other.
