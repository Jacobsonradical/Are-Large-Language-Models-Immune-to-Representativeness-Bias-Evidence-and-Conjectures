To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed men exceeded 183 cm, let's analyze the data collection methods and the distributions involved:

1. **Team 1:**
   - Every day, Team 1 surveys three men.
   - The height distribution is such that half the men are above 178 cm and half are below.
   - They count the days where the middle man (out of the three surveyed) is taller than 183 cm.

2. **Team 2:**
   - Every day, Team 2 surveys one man.
   - They count the days where this man is taller than 183 cm.

**Key Points:**

- The average height of men is 178 cm, with equal numbers above and below this average.
- We are interested in heights above 183 cm.

**Probability Calculation:**

- For Team 1: To have the middle man taller than 183 cm, at least one of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183 cm.
- For Team 2: Any randomly selected man must be taller than 183 cm.

Let's denote the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm as \( p \).

**Team 1 Probability Calculation:**

Since there are as many men above 178 cm as there are below, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is likely less than 0.5 (since 183 cm is above the average).

The probability that the middle man in a group of three is taller than 183 cm involves more complex combinatorics but can be approximated. Essentially, if \( p \) is the probability that one man is taller than 183 cm, the probability that the middle man in a group of three is taller than 183 cm is influenced by the distribution and correlations among the heights.

**Team 2 Probability Calculation:**

For Team 2, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is simply \( p \).

**Comparison:**

Given the symmetry around the average height of 178 cm and the nature of the distribution, it is likely that the probability \( p \) for a single man being taller than 183 cm is relatively low (likely less than 0.5). Therefore, the probability that the middle man in a group of three is taller than 183 cm will also be relatively low but not negligible.

However, since Team 1 surveys three men each day and Team 2 surveys one, Team 2's count will be directly proportional to the single probability \( p \), while Team 1's count will be influenced by a more complex probability scenario involving three men.

**Conclusion:**

Given the simplified assumptions and the nature of the problem, Team 1 is likely to record fewer days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 2}
