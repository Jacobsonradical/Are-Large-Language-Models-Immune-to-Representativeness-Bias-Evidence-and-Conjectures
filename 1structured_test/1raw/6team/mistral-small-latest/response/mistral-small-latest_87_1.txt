To determine which team recorded more days where the height of the surveyed individuals was more than 183 cm, let's analyze the situation more closely.

### Analysis for Team 1:

1. **Daily Survey Process**:
   - Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
   - The team ranks the three men based on their height and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

2. **Probability Consideration**:
   - Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below, the height distribution is symmetrical around the mean.
   - Since the middle man's height is likely to be close to the average (178 cm), the probability that the middle man's height is above 183 cm is relatively low.

3. **Expected Outcome**:
   - For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, both the shortest and the tallest of the three men surveyed must be shorter or equal to 183 cm.
   - Given the symmetrical distribution, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is significantly lower than the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm.

### Analysis for Team 2:

1. **Daily Survey Process**:
   - Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
   - The team counts the days when the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm.

2. **Probability Consideration**:
   - The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of the population with heights above 183 cm.
   - Given the symmetrical distribution, about half the population (50%) is taller than the average height of 178 cm. However, the exact proportion taller than 183 cm would depend on the specifics of the height distribution but is likely less than 50%.

3. **Expected Outcome**:
   - Over 365 days, the number of days where the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm will be proportional to the percentage of the population that is taller than 183 cm.

### Conclusion:

- **Team 1**: The probability that the middle man of any given trio is taller than 183 cm is lower compared to the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm.
- **Team 2**: The probability that a single randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of such individuals in the population.

Given the analysis, **Team 2** is more likely to count more days where the height of the surveyed individual is more than 183 cm.

Thus, the answer is:

```
{team: 2}
