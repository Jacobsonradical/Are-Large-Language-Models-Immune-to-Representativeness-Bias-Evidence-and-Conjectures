To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed men exceeded 183 cm, let's analyze the scenario for each team:

### Team 1:
- **Process:** Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly and ranks them by height.
- **Criterion:** They count the days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.
- **Consideration:** Since the average height is 178 cm, and the distribution is symmetric around the mean, the middle man's height in any given day will be close to the average. However, for the middle man's height to be more than 183 cm, both the shorter man and the tallest man must be taller than 183 cm.

### Team 2:
- **Process:** Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- **Criterion:** They count the days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.
- **Consideration:** The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm can be estimated based on the distribution of heights. Since the heights are symmetric around the mean, about half the men will be above the mean, and some portion of those will be above 183 cm.

### Comparison:
- For **Team 1**, the middle man's height being more than 183 cm is a less frequent event because it requires the selection of three men where two are taller than 183 cm.
- For **Team 2**, any single man being taller than 183 cm is a more straightforward and potentially more frequent event.

Given the symmetry and the distribution, **Team 2** is likely to record more days where the height of the surveyed man exceeds 183 cm because they are not constrained by the ranking of three men.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reasoning above, **Team 2** is expected to have counted more such days.
