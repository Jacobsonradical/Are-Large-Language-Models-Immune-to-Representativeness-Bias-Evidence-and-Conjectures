To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed men was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the methodology of each team.

Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below it, we can infer that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean. This means that approximately half of the men have heights above 178 cm, and half have heights below 178 cm.

**Team 1:**
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men and ranks them by height.
- The middle man's height (the median of the three men) is compared to 183 cm.
- Because the distribution is symmetric and the average is 178 cm, the median of any random sample of three men will likely be close to the average height, which is 178 cm.
- Therefore, the probability that the median height of the three men is above 183 cm is relatively low.

**Team 2:**
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man and checks if his height is above 183 cm.
- Since the distribution is symmetric around the mean of 178 cm, there will be a certain proportion of men with heights above 183 cm.
- Because Team 2 is surveying individual men, the number of days where the height is above 183 cm will be directly proportional to the percentage of men in the population with heights above 183 cm.

Given this analysis, Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height of the surveyed man is above 183 cm because they are surveying individuals, and the proportion of men above 183 cm will be consistent over time.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 2}
