To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and how each team collects and processes their data.

Given:
- The average height of men is 178 cm.
- There are as many men above the average height as there are below, indicating a symmetric distribution around the mean.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Let's analyze each team's process:

### Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men.
- The middle man's height in a random sample of three men from a symmetric distribution will usually be close to the median of the distribution.
- Since the distribution is symmetric around 178 cm, the median height is also 178 cm.
- Given that the heights are symmetrically distributed, the probability that the middle man's height exceeds 183 cm is less than the probability that a randomly selected man's height exceeds 183 cm.

### Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man.
- The probability that a randomly selected man's height exceeds 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of men in the population with heights above 183 cm.

Given the symmetric distribution and the fact that the heights above and below the mean are equal, it's reasonable to expect that the proportion of men with heights above 183 cm is less than 50%. However, this proportion will still be greater than the probability that the middle man (in Team 1's sample of three) exceeds 183 cm.

### Conclusion:
Team 2 is likely to record more days where the height of the man surveyed exceeds 183 cm because they are sampling directly from the population, whereas Team 1's method of taking the middle of three randomly selected men introduces a bias towards the median height, which is less likely to exceed 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 2}
