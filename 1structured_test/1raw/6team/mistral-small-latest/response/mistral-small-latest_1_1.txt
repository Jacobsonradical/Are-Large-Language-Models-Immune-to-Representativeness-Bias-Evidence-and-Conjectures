To solve this problem, let's break down the scenario and analyze the data collection methods of both teams.

### Team 1:
- Surveys three men each day.
- Ranks the three men by height.
- Counts the days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

### Team 2:
- Surveys one man each day.
- Counts the days where the man's height is more than 183 cm.

### Population Characteristics:
- The average height of men is 178 cm.
- The population is symmetric around the average, meaning there are as many men above the average height as there are below it.

### Analysis:

#### Team 1:
- When three men are selected randomly each day, the middle man's height will typically be close to the average height due to the symmetry of the population distribution.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, the middle man's height will often be below 183 cm.

#### Team 2:
- On any given day, a single man is selected randomly.
- Due to the symmetric distribution, there is an equal probability that the selected man's height is above or below the average.
- Therefore, there is a 50% chance that the selected man's height is above 178 cm and potentially above 183 cm.

### Conclusion:
- Team 1 is more likely to record days where the middle man's height is below 183 cm because the middle man's height will typically be closer to the average height of 178 cm.
- Team 2 has a higher chance of recording days where the height is above 183 cm due to the random selection from the entire population, including those above the average height.

Since Team 2 is likely to count more days where the height is above 183 cm, the answer is:

```
{team: 2}
