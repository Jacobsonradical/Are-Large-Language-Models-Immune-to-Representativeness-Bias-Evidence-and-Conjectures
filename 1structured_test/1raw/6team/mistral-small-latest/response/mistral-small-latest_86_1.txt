To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed men exceeded 183 cm, we need to analyze the data collection methods of both teams.

### Team 1:
- **Method**: Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly and ranks them by height.
- **Criteria**: They count the days on which the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- **Consideration**: Since the average height is 178 cm, and the distribution is symmetric (same number of men above and below average), the middle man in any random group of three men will often be close to the average height. This suggests that the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less likely.

### Team 2:
- **Method**: Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- **Criteria**: They count the days on which the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm.
- **Consideration**: The probability that any one randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm can be inferred from the average and the symmetric distribution. Since the average is 178 cm, there is a considerable portion of the population that is taller than 183 cm.

Given the symmetry of the height distribution and the fact that the average height is 178 cm, it is likely that Team 2 will count more days with men taller than 183 cm because each day they are surveying just one man, and there is a non-trivial probability that this man will be taller than 183 cm.

In comparison, Team 1's method of ranking and focusing on the middle man introduces a different probability distribution where the middle man is less likely to be significantly taller than the average, hence less likely to be taller than 183 cm.

### Conclusion:
Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height of the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
{team: 2}
