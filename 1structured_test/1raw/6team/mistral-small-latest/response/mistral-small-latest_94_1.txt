To determine which team recorded more days with a man taller than 183 cm, we need to analyze the sampling methods and the distribution of heights in the population.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

This implies that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean of 178 cm.

### Team 1
Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

### Team 2
Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days on which the height of the man is more than 183 cm.

### Analysis
For Team 1, the middle man's height being more than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights among the three surveyed men. Since the distribution is symmetric around 178 cm, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is influenced by the chance that two men are at or below 178 cm and one man is above 183 cm.

For Team 2, the probability that a single man is taller than 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

Given the symmetry and the average height, the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is likely less than the proportion of men below 173 cm because the distribution must balance around the mean.

### Conclusion
Since Team 2 is directly counting the days when a man is taller than 183 cm, and Team 1's condition is more restrictive (requiring a specific position in a ranked set of three), Team 2 is more likely to record more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
{team: 2}
