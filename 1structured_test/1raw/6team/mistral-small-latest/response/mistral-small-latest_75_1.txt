To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed individual(s) was more than 183 cm, let's analyze the scenario for each team:

### Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly from the population.
- The average height of men is 178 cm, and the distribution of heights is symmetric around this average.
- Therefore, the middle man's height in any given day's sample of three men will likely be around the average height or slightly above, because the distribution is symmetric.
- The probability that the middle man's height is more than 183 cm is relatively low due to the symmetric distribution.

### Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly from the population.
- The height of this man can be anywhere in the distribution, but due to the symmetric distribution, half of the men will have heights above the average of 178 cm.
- The probability that a randomly selected man has a height more than 183 cm is less than the probability that he has a height above the average (178 cm), but it is not zero.

Given the symmetric distribution and the fact that Team 1 is looking for the middle height among three men, it is more likely that Team 2 will record more days where the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm.

### Conclusion:
Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days.
