To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed individual(s) was more than 183 cm, let's analyze the scenario step by step.

### Team 1 Analysis:
- **Team 1** surveys three men each day and ranks them based on their height.
- The goal is to count the days on which the height of the middle man (in terms of height ranking) is more than 183 cm.

Given that the average height of men is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as there are below:
- The distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, there are equal numbers of men below 178 cm and above 178 cm.

For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm on a given day:
- At least two of the three surveyed men must be taller than 183 cm.
- This is because, for the middle man to exceed 183 cm, one man must be shorter than 183 cm (and possibly 178 cm or less), and the other two must be taller.

The probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is less than the probability of a man being taller than 178 cm. Assuming a normal distribution of heights (for simplicity), the probability that a man is taller than 183 cm is likely less than 50%.

### Team 2 Analysis:
- **Team 2** surveys one man each day.
- The goal is to count the days on which the height of the surveyed man is more than 183 cm.

The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is the same as calculated above. Since Team 2 surveys only one man per day, the probability that he is taller than 183 cm remains consistent with the population distribution.

### Comparison:
- For Team 1, the condition for counting a day is stricter (at least two out of three men must be taller than 183 cm).
- For Team 2, the condition is simpler (one man must be taller than 183 cm).

Given these conditions, Team 2 is more likely to record more days because the condition for counting is more easily met (only one man needs to be taller than 183 cm).

### Conclusion:
Team 2 recorded more such days.
