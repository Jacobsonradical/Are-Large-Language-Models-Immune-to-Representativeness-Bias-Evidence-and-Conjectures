To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed men met the criteria, let's analyze the problem step by step.

**Team 1:**
- Each day, Team 1 selects three men randomly from the population.
- The average height of men is around 178 cm, with the distribution symmetrically split above and below this average.
- The team counts the days where the height of the middle man (out of the three) is more than 183 cm.

**Team 2:**
- Each day, Team 2 selects one man randomly from the population.
- The team counts the days where the height of this man is more than 183 cm.

**Key Points:**
1. The height distribution is symmetric around the mean of 178 cm.
2. The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is less than 50% because 183 cm is significantly higher than the mean height of 178 cm.

**Team 1 Analysis:**
- When three men are selected, the middle man's height could be anywhere in the range from the shortest to the tallest.
- For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, both the shortest and the tallest men selected that day must be below 183 cm, which is less likely due to the symmetric distribution and the high threshold of 183 cm.

**Team 2 Analysis:**
- For Team 2, any single man selected has a fixed probability (less than 50%) of being taller than 183 cm.
- Over 365 days, this probability will average out, and the number of days where the selected man is taller than 183 cm will be consistent with this probability.

**Conclusion:**
- Team 1 is likely to record fewer days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm because the conditions for this are more stringent (both the shortest and tallest must be below 183 cm).
- Team 2 has a consistent probability for each day, and over 365 days, this should result in a more predictable and possibly higher count of days where the man is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, the expected outcome is that Team 2 recorded more such days.
