To determine which team counted more days, let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Team 1 Analysis:

- **Daily Process**: Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- **Condition**: They count the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below, the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean. This implies:

1. **Probability Distribution**: The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5 because 183 cm is more than one standard deviation above the mean (assuming a normal distribution).
2. **Ranking**: For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least one of the other two men must be shorter than 178 cm (to make the middle man not the shortest), and the middle man must be taller than 183 cm.

### Team 2 Analysis:

- **Daily Process**: Team 2 surveys one man each day.
- **Condition**: They count the number of days when the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm.

2. **Probability**: The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is the same as for Team 1, but they only need one man to meet the condition.

### Comparison:

1. **Team 1**: Needs the middle of three men to be above 183 cm, which is a less likely scenario due to the ranking requirement.
2. **Team 2**: Needs any one man to be above 183 cm, which is a more straightforward and likely scenario.

Given these considerations, Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the condition is met because their condition is simpler and more frequent.

### Conclusion:

\[
\text{{team: 2}}
\]
