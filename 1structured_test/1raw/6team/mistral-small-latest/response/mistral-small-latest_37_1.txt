To determine which team recorded more days where the height of the surveyed men exceeded 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the methodology used by each team.

Given:
- The average height of men is 178 cm.
- There are as many men above the average height as there are below the average height.

This implies a symmetric distribution of heights around the mean. Since the average is 178 cm, the distribution is balanced on either side of this mean.

**Team 1:**
- Surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- The middle man's height being more than 183 cm suggests that the distribution of heights among the three surveyed men is skewed toward taller heights.

**Team 2:**
- Surveys one man each day and counts the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.
- This is a direct measure of the proportion of men taller than 183 cm in the population.

Given the symmetric distribution around the mean, the proportion of men taller than 183 cm will be less than the proportion of men shorter than 183 cm because 183 cm is above the average height of 178 cm.

**Analysis:**
- For Team 1, the condition that the middle man's height is more than 183 cm implies that at least two of the three surveyed men must be taller than 183 cm (since the middle one must be taller than both).
- For Team 2, the condition is simply that the one surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.

Since the distribution is symmetric and the average is 178 cm, the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is less than the proportion of men between 178 cm and 183 cm. Thus, Team 1 is more likely to record fewer days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2.

**Conclusion:**
Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 2}
