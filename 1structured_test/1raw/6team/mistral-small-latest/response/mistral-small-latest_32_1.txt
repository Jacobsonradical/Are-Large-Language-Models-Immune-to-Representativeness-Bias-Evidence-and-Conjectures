To answer this question, let's analyze the situation for both teams:

### Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men randomly.
- The average height of men is 178 cm.
- There are as many men above the average height as there are below the average height.
- They count the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

### Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man randomly.
- They count the days when the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm.

To determine which team counted more such days, we need to consider the distribution of heights and the probability of selecting men taller than 183 cm.

### Height Distribution:
Given that there are as many men above the average height as there are below, we can infer that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean of 178 cm. This means that approximately half of the men are taller than 178 cm and half are shorter.

### Probability of Selecting Men Taller than 183 cm:
Let's denote \( p \) as the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm. Since the distribution is symmetric and we know the average height, the probability that a man is taller than 183 cm will be less than 0.5 but not insignificantly small since 183 cm is only 5 cm above the average.

### Team 1 Analysis:
- On any given day, the probability that the middle man among three randomly selected men is taller than 183 cm is related to the overall distribution.
- The middle man's height will generally be closer to the median (178 cm) than to the extremes.
- Therefore, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is likely lower than the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm.

### Team 2 Analysis:
- On any given day, the probability that the one randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is simply \( p \).

### Comparison:
- Team 2's count is directly related to \( p \), the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm.
- Team 1's count is related to a lower probability scenario (the middle man being taller than 183 cm).

Given these considerations, Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.

### Conclusion:
{team: 2}
