To determine which team recorded more days where the height of the surveyed individuals was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the methodologies of the two teams.

Given:
- The average height of men is 178 cm.
- There are as many men above the average height as there are below.

This implies that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean of 178 cm. If we assume a normal distribution for simplicity, this would mean that 50% of the men are taller than 178 cm and 50% are shorter.

### Team 1 Analysis:
Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man (in terms of height) is taller than 183 cm.

For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm:
- The shortest of the three men must be below 183 cm.
- The other two men must be above 183 cm.

Since 50% of the men are taller than 178 cm, a significant portion of these men will also be taller than 183 cm. However, the probability that all three men are taller than 183 cm is lower because the distribution tapers off as you move further from the mean.

### Team 2 Analysis:
Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when that man is taller than 183 cm.

The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of the population that is taller than 183 cm. Given the symmetric distribution and the mean height, it's reasonable to expect that a considerable portion of men (likely more than 50%) are taller than 183 cm.

### Comparison:
- For Team 1, the event of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less likely compared to Team 2's criterion, because it requires the specific configuration of three men's heights.
- For Team 2, the event of any single man being taller than 183 cm is more straightforward and likely to occur more frequently because it doesn't depend on the heights of other men surveyed the same day.

### Conclusion:
Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the height of the surveyed man is more than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:
```
{team: 2}
