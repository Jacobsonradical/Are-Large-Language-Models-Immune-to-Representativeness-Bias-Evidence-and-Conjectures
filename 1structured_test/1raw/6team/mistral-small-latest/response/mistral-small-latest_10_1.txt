To determine which team counted more days, we need to analyze the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric around the mean, we can infer that the heights are normally distributed.

Given the symmetry and the average height, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm can be estimated. However, without specific details on the standard deviation or the exact distribution, we can make some general observations:

1. **Team 1**: Each day, Team 1 surveys three men and ranks them. The middle man's height being more than 183 cm implies that at least two of the three men surveyed are taller than 183 cm. The probability of this happening is lower than the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm, because it requires two out of three men to be taller than 183 cm.

2. **Team 2**: Each day, Team 2 surveys one man. The probability that this man is taller than 183 cm is simply the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm.

Given that the requirement for Team 1 is stricter (at least two out of three men need to be taller than 183 cm), the number of days Team 1 records is likely to be less than the number of days Team 2 records.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
