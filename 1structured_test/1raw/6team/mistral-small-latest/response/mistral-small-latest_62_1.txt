To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed individuals was more than 183 cm, let's analyze the problem step by step.

### Team 1 Analysis:
- **Team 1** surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average (178 cm) as there are men whose height is below average.

Given this symmetry, the distribution of heights is likely normal (or symmetric around the mean). The middle man in each group of three is likely close to the average height because of the symmetry in the distribution. Therefore, it is less likely that the middle man's height will exceed 183 cm significantly often.

### Team 2 Analysis:
- **Team 2** surveys one man each day.
- The probability that a randomly selected man from the population has a height greater than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights in the population.

If we assume a normal distribution of heights centered around 178 cm with a standard deviation (σ), we can calculate the probability that a man's height exceeds 183 cm.

For a normal distribution:
- The z-score for a height of 183 cm is \( \frac{183 - 178}{\sigma} = \frac{5}{\sigma} \).

Without the specific value of σ, we can infer that the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm will be less than 50% due to the symmetry around the mean. However, this probability is non-zero and could be substantial depending on the spread (σ) of the distribution.

### Comparison:
- **Team 1** is less likely to have the middle man exceed 183 cm frequently because the middle man is usually around the average height due to the symmetrical distribution.
- **Team 2** has a consistent chance (albeit low) every day that the single man surveyed will exceed 183 cm.

Given these points, **Team 2** is more likely to count more days where the height of the surveyed individual exceeds 183 cm compared to **Team 1**.

### Conclusion:
```
{team: 2}
