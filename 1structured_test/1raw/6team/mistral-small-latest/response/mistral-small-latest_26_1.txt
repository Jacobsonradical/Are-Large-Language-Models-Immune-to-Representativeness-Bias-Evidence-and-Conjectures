To determine which team recorded more days, let's analyze the problem step by step:

### Team 1 Analysis:
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- The average height of men is 178 cm, and there are as many men above this height as there are below it.
- We are interested in the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the distribution of heights is symmetric around the average, the middle man's height on any given day will also be symmetrically distributed around 178 cm. For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, he must be in the upper tail of the height distribution. Given the symmetric distribution and the average height, it is reasonable to assume that the middle man will be taller than 183 cm less frequently than the average man being taller than 183 cm.

### Team 2 Analysis:
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Given the symmetric distribution, 50% of the men are taller than 178 cm.
- A significant portion of these men will be taller than 183 cm, but this portion will be less than 50% of the total population due to the symmetry and the average height.

### Comparison:
- For Team 1, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is less than the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm because the middle man's height is constrained by the other two men surveyed.
- For Team 2, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of men taller than 183 cm in the population.

Given these points, Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm.

### Conclusion:
{team: 2}
