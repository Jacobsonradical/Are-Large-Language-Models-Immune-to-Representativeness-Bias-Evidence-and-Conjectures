To determine which team recorded more days where the height of the surveyed individuals was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distributions and the methodologies of both teams.

For Team 1:
- Each day, they survey three men randomly.
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men above the average height as below.
- They count the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they survey one man randomly.
- They count the days when the height of the man is more than 183 cm.

Given that the heights are symmetrically distributed around the average:
- Half the men are above 178 cm, and half are below.
- The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is less than half because 183 cm is above the average height.

For Team 1:
- When three men are selected randomly, the middle man in height will likely be close to the average height of 178 cm.
- The probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is less than the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they simply check if the one man selected is taller than 183 cm.
- The probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is the same every day.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the height of the surveyed individual is more than 183 cm because they are checking against a higher threshold more directly and frequently.

So, the answer is:
{team: 2}
