Let's analyze the two teams' data collection methods to determine which team likely counted more days where the height of the surveyed man was more than 183 cm.

### Team 1:
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 counts the days when the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Given the average height and the symmetry of the height distribution, the middle man's height will likely be around the average or slightly above. Therefore, the probability that the middle man's height is above 183 cm is relatively low.

### Team 2:
- Team 2 surveys one man each day.
- They count the days when the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm.

Since the height distribution is symmetric around the average, 50% of the men will have heights above the average of 178 cm. Therefore, a significant portion of these men will have heights above 183 cm.

### Comparison:
- For Team 1, the middle man's height being above 183 cm is a less frequent event because it requires the two other men surveyed to be shorter than or equal to 183 cm.
- For Team 2, any man surveyed has a 50% chance of being above the average height, and thus, a good portion of these will be above 183 cm.

Given these considerations, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the height of the surveyed man is more than 183 cm.

### Conclusion:
Team 2 recorded more such days.
