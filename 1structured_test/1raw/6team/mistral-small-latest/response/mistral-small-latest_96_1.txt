To determine which team recorded more days where the height of the surveyed individuals exceeded 183 cm, we need to analyze the methods and probabilities involved in each team's data collection.

### Team 1 Analysis
Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days on which the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Given the average height of 178 cm and the symmetrical distribution of heights around this average, the middle man's height in a group of three men will be around the average height or slightly above it.

The probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights. Since the population is symmetric around the average, the middle value in a sample of three men will generally be close to the average height but can vary. However, it is less likely to be significantly above 183 cm due to the distribution of heights.

### Team 2 Analysis
Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days on which this man's height is more than 183 cm. The probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm can be estimated by considering the distribution of heights. Given the symmetry and the average height, approximately half of the population will have heights above the average of 178 cm.

However, the proportion of men with heights above 183 cm will be less than half because 183 cm is above the average. Nonetheless, every day Team 2 has a chance to record a height above 183 cm, whereas Team 1 only records it if the middle of three men's heights is above 183 cm, which is less likely due to the averaging effect.

### Conclusion
Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the height exceeds 183 cm because each daily survey presents a direct opportunity for the tallest heights to be recorded, without the averaging effect present in Team 1's method.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 2}
