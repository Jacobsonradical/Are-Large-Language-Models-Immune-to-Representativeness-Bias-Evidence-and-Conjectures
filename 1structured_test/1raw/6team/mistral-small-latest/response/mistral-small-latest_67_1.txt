To determine which team counted more days where the height of the men surveyed was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and how each team conducts its surveys.

Given:
- The average height of men is 178 cm.
- The population is symmetrically distributed around the average, meaning there are as many men taller as there are shorter than the average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

### Team 1 Analysis:
- When Team 1 surveys three men, the middle man's height will typically be around the average height or slightly above, given the symmetric distribution.
- For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, both the shortest and the tallest men surveyed on that day must be taller than 183 cm.
- The probability that all three men are taller than 183 cm is relatively low because 183 cm is significantly above the average height of 178 cm.

### Team 2 Analysis:
- Team 2 surveys one man each day, and the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of men in the population taller than 183 cm.
- Given the symmetric distribution and the average height of 178 cm, the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is likely to be significant but not overwhelming.

### Conclusion:
- Team 1 is counting days where all three men surveyed are taller than 183 cm, which is a rare event.
- Team 2 is counting days where any one man surveyed is taller than 183 cm, which is a more common event.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm.
