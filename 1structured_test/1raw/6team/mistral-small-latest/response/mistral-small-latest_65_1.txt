Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when that man's height is more than 183 cm.

Given that the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above the average height as there are below, the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean. This implies that the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is less than 50% because 183 cm is significantly higher than the average height of 178 cm.

For Team 1, the middle man's height being more than 183 cm is a less likely event compared to Team 2's single man being more than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 1 is likely to record fewer days where the middle man's height exceeds 183 cm compared to Team 2, which simply counts any man taller than 183 cm.

Thus, the team that counted more such days is likely Team 2.
