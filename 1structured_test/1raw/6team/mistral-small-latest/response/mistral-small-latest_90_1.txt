{team: 3}

Explanation:
Given that the average height of men is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below this average, the height distribution is symmetric around 178 cm. Since the heights are symmetrically distributed, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm from the population on any given day is the same regardless of the team.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and focuses only on the middle man's height. The middle man's height being more than 183 cm implies that at least two of the three men surveyed are taller than 183 cm. However, since the distribution is symmetric, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm on any given day remains consistent with the overall population distribution.

Team 2 surveys one man each day and checks if his height is above 183 cm. The probability of selecting such a man is also consistent with the overall population distribution.

Therefore, both teams are likely to encounter men taller than 183 cm with approximately the same frequency over the 365 days, and the numbers they count are expected to be about the same (within 5% of each other).
