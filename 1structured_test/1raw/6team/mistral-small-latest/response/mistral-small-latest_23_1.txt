To determine which team recorded more days where the height of the surveyed men was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the sampling methods of the two teams.

Given that the average height of men is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below, the height distribution is symmetric about the mean. This implies that the median height is also 178 cm.

**Team 1:**
- Surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- The middle man's height is the 2nd highest out of the three surveyed.
- For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183 cm.

**Team 2:**
- Surveys one man each day and counts the days when that man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Any man surveyed on a given day could be taller than 183 cm.

Since the height distribution is symmetric and the median is 178 cm, approximately 50% of men are taller than 178 cm. Assuming a normal distribution, the proportion of men taller than 183 cm would be a subset of this 50%.

Because Team 1 requires at least two out of three men to be taller than 183 cm for the middle man to meet the criteria, the probability of this happening is lower than the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm (Team 2's criteria).

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the height of the surveyed man is more than 183 cm compared to Team 1.

Answer:
{team: 2}
