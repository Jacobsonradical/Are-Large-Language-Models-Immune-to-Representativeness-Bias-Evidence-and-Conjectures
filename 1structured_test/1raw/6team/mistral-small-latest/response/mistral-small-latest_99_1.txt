{team: 2}

Explanation:
Team 2 is surveying one man each day, and their count of days with a man taller than 183 cm directly reflects the proportion of men in the population taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and the distribution is symmetric around the average, we can infer that the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

Team 1, on the other hand, is surveying three men each day and counting the days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm. Given the symmetric distribution, the middle man's height is likely to be closer to the average, which is 178 cm. Therefore, it is less likely that the middle man's height will exceed 183 cm compared to any randomly selected man.

Thus, Team 2 is more likely to record more such days.
