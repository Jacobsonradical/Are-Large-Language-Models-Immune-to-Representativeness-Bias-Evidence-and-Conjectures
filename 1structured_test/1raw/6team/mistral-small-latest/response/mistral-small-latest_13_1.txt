To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed men was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the methodology of each team.

Given that the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as there are below, we can infer that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean. This means that half of the men are taller than 178 cm and half are shorter.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days on which the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. The middle man in a random sample of three men is likely to be close to the median of the population, which is 178 cm. Since the distribution is symmetric, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is less than the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days on which that man's height is more than 183 cm. Since half of the men are taller than the average, the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm is 0.5 (50%).

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days where the height of the surveyed man is more than 183 cm compared to Team 1.

So the answer is:
{team: 2}
