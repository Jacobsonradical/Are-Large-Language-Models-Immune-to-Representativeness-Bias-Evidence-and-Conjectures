To determine which team counted more days where the height of the surveyed individuals exceeded 183 cm, we need to analyze the data collection methods of both teams and the distribution of heights in the population.

1. **Team 1 Analysis**:
   - Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
   - They count the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
   - Given that the average height is 178 cm, and the distribution is symmetric around the average, there are as many men above 178 cm as there are below.
   - To have the middle man above 183 cm, both of the other two men (one taller and one shorter) must be below this height.

2. **Team 2 Analysis**:
   - Team 2 surveys one man each day.
   - They count the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.
   - Since the height distribution is symmetric, the probability that a randomly chosen man is taller than 183 cm is 0.5 (because the distribution is symmetric and the average is 178 cm).

Given these points:
- For Team 1, the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less likely because it requires the other two men to be shorter than 183 cm.
- For Team 2, the probability of any man being taller than 183 cm is simply 0.5.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the height exceeds 183 cm.

Answer:
{team: 2}
