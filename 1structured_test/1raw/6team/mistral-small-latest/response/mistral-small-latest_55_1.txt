To determine which team counted more days where the height of the men surveyed was more than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the methodology of each team's survey.

Given that the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can infer that the height distribution is symmetric around the mean. This implies that the distribution of heights is likely normal (since a normal distribution is symmetric and unimodal).

### Team 1:
Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. They count the days on which the height of the middle man (second tallest of the three) is more than 183 cm.

For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, both the tallest and the second tallest men in the sample of three must be taller than 183 cm. This is a more stringent condition than just having one man taller than 183 cm, which Team 2 is observing.

### Team 2:
Team 2 surveys only one man each day and counts the days on which that man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm from the population is less than the probability of selecting a man taller than the mean (178 cm). However, it is more likely than selecting a man shorter than 173 cm (178 - 5 cm, where 5 cm is the difference between 183 cm and the mean).

### Comparison:
- **Team 1** has a higher threshold for counting a day (both the tallest and the second tallest must be above 183 cm).
- **Team 2** has a simpler and more direct threshold (any man above 183 cm counts).

Given the symmetric distribution and the more stringent condition for Team 1, it is likely that Team 2 will count more days where the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm.

### Conclusion:
{team: 2}
