Given the information, let's analyze the situation:

1. **Team 1**:
   - Surveys three men each day.
   - Ranks them by height and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
   - Since the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric, the middle man's height will often be close to the average. Therefore, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is relatively low.

2. **Team 2**:
   - Surveys one man each day.
   - Counts the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.
   - With the average height being 178 cm and a symmetric distribution, there are as many men taller than 183 cm as there are shorter than 173 cm. This means the probability of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm is significant.

Given these factors, Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm because the threshold for the middle man in Team 1's survey is higher and less likely to be met.

Therefore, the answer is:

```
{team: 2}
```
