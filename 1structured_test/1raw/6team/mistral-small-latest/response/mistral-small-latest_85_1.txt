{team: 2}

Explanation:
Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the distribution of heights is symmetric around the average of 178 cm, half of the men are taller than 183 cm. Therefore, on average, Team 2 will count 182.5 days (half of 365) when the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them. The middle man's height being more than 183 cm is a less frequent event compared to any single man being taller than 183 cm. This is because for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two of the three men must be taller than 183 cm, which is less likely than just one man being taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 1 is expected to count fewer days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm compared to Team 2.
