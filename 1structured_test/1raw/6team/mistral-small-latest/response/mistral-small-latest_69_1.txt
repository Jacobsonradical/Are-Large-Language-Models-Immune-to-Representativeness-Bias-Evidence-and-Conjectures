{team: 3}

Explanation: Given that the average height of men is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below this average, the distribution of heights is symmetric around 178 cm. This means that the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm from the population is the same regardless of whether one, two, or three men are selected each day. Therefore, both teams are likely to count similar numbers of days where the surveyed men meet the height criterion. Hence, they are about the same (within 5% of each other).
