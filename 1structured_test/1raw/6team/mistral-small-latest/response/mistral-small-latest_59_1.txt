To determine which team recorded more days, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the methodology used by each team.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

### Analysis for Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 selects three men randomly.
- The middle man's height will be more than 183 cm only if at least two of the selected men are taller than 183 cm.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men above and below the average, we can assume a symmetric distribution around the mean.
- To find the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm, we need to consider the probability that in a random sample of three men, at least two are taller than 183 cm.

### Analysis for Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 selects one man randomly.
- The probability that this man is taller than 183 cm can be directly inferred from the population distribution.

### Comparison:
- For Team 2, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is simply the proportion of men taller than 183 cm in the population.
- For Team 1, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm involves more complex calculations but is generally lower than the direct probability for Team 2 because it requires at least two out of three men to be taller than 183 cm.

Given these considerations, Team 2 is likely to record more days where the man's height is more than 183 cm because the condition for Team 1 is more restrictive.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 2}
