{team: 2}

Explanation:
Team 2 is surveying one randomly selected man each day, so the probability that the man they survey is taller than 183 cm is directly related to the distribution of heights in the population. With an average height of 178 cm and a perfectly symmetrical distribution, half of the surveyed men will be above the average height (178 cm), and the distribution is assumed to be normal. Thus, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm can be approximated by the corresponding proportion in the normal distribution.

Team 1, on the other hand, surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. The middle man in this ranking will not necessarily align with the average probability calculated above for a randomly selected individual, as the distribution's properties change slightly when sampling and ranking multiple individuals. 

The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm should be considered. However, given the central tendency and the properties of a normal distribution, he's most likely still going to be closer to the central mean, with slightly less variation going beyond those extreme points compared to the single random selection by Team 2. Thus, Team 2 stands a slightly better chance of having more individuals above 183 cm due to more direct sampling and the properties of the normal distribution not being 'tempered' by the middle rank separation. Overall, both approaches will yield close results, but Team 2's method has a more direct probability alignment.
