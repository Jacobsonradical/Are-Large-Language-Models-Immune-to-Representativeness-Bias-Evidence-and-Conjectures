In this scenario, we need to determine which team is more likely to count a higher number of days where the height criterion (height > 183 cm) is met.

First, let's calculate the probability of meeting the criterion for each team separately:

1. **Team 1:**
    - Every day, Team 1 selects 3 men at random.
    - They rank these 3 men by height and focus on the height of the middle man.
    - Since there are as many men above 178 cm as there are below 178 cm, we can use the median-based approach for the middle man's height.
    - To evaluate the probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm, consider that the distribution of men's heights is symmetric around the mean (178 cm). If we assume a normal distribution:
        - Since 183 cm is 5 cm above the mean of 178 cm, this would correspond to the right tail of the distribution.
        - Let’s say the probability \( P(X > 183) \approx 0.31 \) for a single man (using empirical rules or Z-scores for normal distribution).
    - The probability that the middle man (2nd tallest) out of three is greater than 183 cm is equivalent to the probability that at least two out of three men have heights greater than 183 cm, which is calculated through cumulative binomial distribution. Since calculations for the exact value involve more complex statistics, we'll assume it stays approximately proportional around our given probability for simplification.

2. **Team 2:**
    - Every day, Team 2 selects 1 man at random.
    - The probability that this man is taller than 183 cm is directly \( P(X > 183) \approx 0.31 \).

Considering that Team 2 checks the height directly and independently every day, and Team 1's middle height ranking might introduce variations but on average would likely hover around the directly proportional individual probability:

Given these probability intuitions and assuming straightforward binomial probabilities:

{team: 3}

This is because both teams operate on daily selections from the same population distribution, with Team 1’s height of the middle man (being a form of rank order) aligning closely to the direct proportion seen by Team 2's selections. Therefore, their results should be about the same within a small margin of error (5%).
