{team: 2}

Here is the reasoning for this answer:

Team 1 is selecting three men each day and ranking them. The height of the middle man in a set of three will tend to cluster around the average height of 178 cm. The probability that the middle man has a height significantly above average (like more than 183 cm) will be lower than the probability that any random single man has a height above 183 cm.

Team 2, on the other hand, surveys one random man each day. Since the population is equally split around the average height, thereâ€™s a straightforward probability that on any given day, they select a man taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 2's count will be higher because they are simply sampling from the population without the additional clustering effect of ranking.
