{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to count more days where the height of the man surveyed is greater than 183 cm. 

Here is the reasoning:

- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and the distribution is symmetrical around this average, implying that approximately 50% of the men have a height above 178 cm and 50% below.
- Each team is conducting surveys over 365 days.

For Team 1:
- They select three men randomly each day and rank them by height.
- The height of the middle man will be above 183 cm only if at least two out of the three men selected have a height above 183 cm.
- The probability that any one man is taller than 183 cm is not high, given that only a portion of the population exceeds this height.
- Therefore, the probability that the middle man in a group of three is taller than 183 cm will be relatively low.

For Team 2:
- They survey one random man each day.
- The probability that this single man is taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability that the middle man out of a group of three is taller than 183 cm. This is because there is no condition on ranking; it's just the chance that a single man exceeds 183 cm, which is simpler and more likely given the overall distribution.

Overall, Team 2 is more likely to have a higher count of surveyed men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
