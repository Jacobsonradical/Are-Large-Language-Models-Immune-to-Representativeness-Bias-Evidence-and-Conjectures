Given the conditions, we can compare the expectations of the number of days each team recorded where the height in question is more than 183 cm.

- **Team 1 Strategy**: Each day, Team 1 surveys three men and considers the height of the middle (median) man. The team counts the number of days the median height is more than 183 cm.
- **Team 2 Strategy**: Each day, Team 2 surveys one man and checks if his height is more than 183 cm.

### Analysis

#### Team 1:
For Team 1, each day three men are surveyed and their heights are ranked. The median height (second tallest) is the threshold to compare against 183 cm.
- Since height distribution is symmetric around the mean (178 cm), and there are equal numbers of men below and above the mean, the probability of a given man being taller than 183 cm is the same as being taller than \( 178 + 5 = 183 \) cm.
- Height exceeds 183 cm \( 50% - \text{fraction of men shorter by 183 cm from 178 cm}\).
- For the middle manâ€™s height to exceed 183 cm, at least two of the three men surveyed must be taller than 183 cm.
  
#### Team 2:
For Team 2, the daily surveyed one man's height is counted if taller than 183 cm.
- The straightforward probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same calculation above using symmetric distribution.

### Probability (Consider Both)
Every man has around the same probability.

#### Conclusion
Considering the height distribution, most choices and chances, the equivalency of surveying individually or triplet setups are expected to meet symmetrical same chances.

Thus, it highlights relatively similar percentage with different calculations point.
