To answer this question, we need to consider the statistical properties of the heights sampled by both teams. Here's the analysis:

- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- The heights are symmetrically distributed; that is, the probability of a man being above the average height (178 cm) is equal to the probability of being below it.

### Team 1:
Team 1 surveys three men daily and ranks them. Since the heights are symmetrically distributed, the heights of these three men are independent and identically distributed. The middle man's height is essentially the median of these three randomly sampled heights.

For the median of three values from a symmetric distribution, the probability that this median is greater than any given threshold corresponds to only those cases where at least two of the three values are above that threshold.

Given that the average height is 178 cm, and 183 cm is somewhat higher than 178 cm, the probability that a single man's height is above 183 cm is \(P(X > 183)\). For simplicity, assume that height distribution is approximated to follow a normal distribution with mean 178 cm. Hence, if we continue with this assumption, we can look at the cumulative distribution to find the probabilities. For practical purposes here, the normal distribution properties ensure that the probability calculation holds.

The probability that the middle height exceeds 183 cm is higher because it requires at least two of the sampled men to exceed this threshold due to the assortative ranking. Specifically, the middle man's height exceeding 183 cm correlates to a combination event with independent probabilities.

### Team 2:
Team 2 samples only one man daily. Simply, the probability that a single randomly chosen man exceeds 183 cm is direct.

### Comparison:
- Each member in Team 2's sample individually has to exceed 183 cm.
- In contrast, Team 1â€™s median man benefit from the property of statistical sampling such that even if one or two men are below 183 cm, the aggregated median value shifts slightly higher than the arithmetic mean approach.

Without exact probabilistic calculation but reflecting on the quantiles and median nature, intuitively, Team 1 is likely to count more days meeting the threshold of the middle man >= 183 cm more often than not in the sampling process.

Thus, the answer would be:

```json
{team: 1}
```
Team 1 potentially records more days where the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm because of the median value context in small sample statistics.
