{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the height of the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm. This is because each day they are checking a single individual's height against the threshold of 183 cm, and with half the population being above the average height of 178 cm, consistently finding men above 183 cm over 365 days is more probable. 

In contrast, Team 1 is surveying three men each day and considering only the height of the middle (second tallest) man. For the second tallest among three randomly chosen men to be above 183 cm more frequently, the overall height distribution criteria are much stricter. Thus, Team 1 is less likely to meet the criterion as often as Team 2, explaining the different counts.
