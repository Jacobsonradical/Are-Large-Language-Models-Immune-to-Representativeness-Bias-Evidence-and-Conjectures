{team: 3}

Since the distribution of men's heights is assumed to be symmetric around the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a man's height being above 183 cm is the same regardless of whether one person or three people are surveyed.

For Team 1, when they survey three men and rank them, the probability that the middle man's height is above 183 cm is still based on the same distribution. Given the central limit theorem and the properties of a symmetric distribution, the middle value (median) of a small sample (like 3 men) also tends to reflect the population's distribution fairly closely.

For Team 2, they directly record whether the height of the one man surveyed is above 183 cm, which directly relies on the same distribution.

Therefore, over a large enough sample size (365 days), the fraction of days where the height of the surveyed men is above 183 cm should converge to the same value for both teams, leading to similar counts within a reasonable margin of error (5%).

So based on probabilistic reasoning, the counts of days should be about the same for both teams.
