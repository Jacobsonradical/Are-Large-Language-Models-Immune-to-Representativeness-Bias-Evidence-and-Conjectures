Given the distribution of heights and the specifics of the sampling methods for both teams, we need to consider the probability of the height of the surveyed individuals meeting the criteria for being above 183 cm.

To summarize:
- The average height of the men is 178 cm.
- The heights are symmetrically distributed around this average.
- Therefore, half of the men are above 178 cm and half are below it.

For **Team 2**:
- Each day they randomly survey one man.
- The probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm is calculated using the percentile of the normal distribution centered at 178 cm.
- Since 183 cm is 5 cm above the mean, we have to find the probability \( P(X > 183) \) where X is normally distributed with mean 178. Given that 183 cm is roughly 0.33 standard deviations above the mean in a typical distribution where heights follow human biological constraints, this translates to about 37.5% of the population being taller than 183 cm. Hence, the expected number of days in which Team 2 finds a man taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.375 * 365 â‰ˆ 137 days.

For **Team 1**:
- Each day they survey three men and rank them by height.
- We're interested in the height of the middle man, which in a random sample will tend to be the median of the sample.
- To be above 183 cm, the middle value out of a typical random 3-man sample must itself exceed 183 cm.
- Considering the normal distribution again, the middle height of three randomly selected individuals is most often closer to the mean. The percentile where a man taller than 183 cm would be the middle man is more complicated to calculate, but intuitively, it is less probable than the single sample method.

Given these considerations:
- For Team 2, the events of interest (height greater than 183 cm) occur 37.5% per day.
- For Team 1, the probability is harder to estimate but is definitely lower because selecting the median value from 3 men to be above 183 cm is less probable than just selecting one man above 183 cm.

Thus, we infer:
```{
team: 2
}```
