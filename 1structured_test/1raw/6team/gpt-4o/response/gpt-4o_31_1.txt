{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the height of the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 surveys one randomly selected man each day, giving a straightforward estimate of the probability that a man's height is above 183 cm. Given that the average height is 178 cm and assuming a normal distribution, about 50% of men will be above average, and the distribution's tail will determine how many are above 183 cm.

In contrast, Team 1 surveys three men each day and considers only the middle height. The middle height in a sample of three has a different distribution compared to a single random selection. The middle height is more centered around the median of the population, making it less likely to be extreme values higher than 183 cm compared to a single random selection. Thus, the probability that the middle height exceeds 183 cm on any given day is lower than the probability that a randomly selected man's height exceeds 183 cm.
