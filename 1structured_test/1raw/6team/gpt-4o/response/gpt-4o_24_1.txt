First, letâ€™s understand the statistical implications here:

- **Team 1:** Surveys three men each day and looks at the height of the middle man (the median height in a sample of three).
- **Team 2:** Surveys one man each day and records if he is taller than 183 cm.

Since the height distribution is balanced around the average of 178 cm, the height of the middle man among three randomly selected men will be, on average, very close to the population mean height. 

To make it clearer:
- For Team 1, the probability that the median height of three men is more than 183 cm is equivalent to a situation where majority (at least two) of the three men surveyed have heights more than 183 cm.
- In a symmetric distribution, with an average of 178 cm, roughly 50% of men will be shorter than 178 cm and 50% will be taller. The probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%, considering 183 cm is above the average.

Generally:
- The probability of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm can be denoted as \( P(X > 183) \).
- The probability of the median of three men being taller than 183 cm involves combinatorial considerations but, given the symmetric nature around 178 cm and the moderate height threshold increase (178 to 183), this probability is lower due to the necessary condition of majority being taller than 183 cm.

Given that:
1. The likelihood of a single individual being over 183 cm is straightforward.
2. The likelihood of two out of three individuals being taller than 183 cm is lower due to combinations (binomial probabilities).

Therefore, **Team 2** is more likely to count a higher number of days with at least one man above 183 cm than **Team 1** due to the simpler individual survey condition compared to the grouped median criterion.

In conclusion:
{team: 2}
