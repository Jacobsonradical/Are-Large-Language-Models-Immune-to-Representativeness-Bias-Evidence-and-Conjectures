{team: 3}

The critical insight here is that, since the heights of men in the population are symmetrically distributed around the average height of 178 cm, each man has an equal probability of being above or below any particular threshold (e.g., 183 cm).

For Team 1, every day they select three men randomly, and the height of the middle man (the median) will be more than 183 cm if at least two of the three selected men are taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, every day they select one man randomly and simply check if that man's height is over 183 cm.

Both teams essentially rely on the same population probabilities, where each man's chance of being over 183 cm is symmetrically distributed. This means both teams are equally likely to count the number of days on which a surveyed man's height exceeds 183 cm, taking into account the large number of surveys (365 days).

Thus, both teams recorded about the same number of days where the height criterion above 183 cm was met, within a reasonable margin of error (5%).
