{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to record more days where the height of the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 surveys one man each day, and the probability that this one man is taller than 183 cm is consistent with the overall distribution.

Team 1, on the other hand, surveys three men each day and selects the middle man (the median) based on height. The height of the median man is less variable than that of a randomly chosen man, and it is less likely for the median of three men to be above 183 cm, given that the average height of the population is 178 cm. Therefore, Team 2 should inherently have more days where the surveyed height exceeds 183 cm.
