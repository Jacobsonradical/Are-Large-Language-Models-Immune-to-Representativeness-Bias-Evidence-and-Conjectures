{team: 3}

Explanation: The problem states that the heights of men in the population are normally distributed around an average height of 178 cm, with half the population above 178 cm and half below it. Since both teams have a random sampling process, they are equally likely to encounter men above or below the 183 cm threshold. 

For Team 1, the middle man out of three randomly selected men is essentially a median height and thus is more likely to be near the average height of the population (178 cm). There will be some days where the median height is significantly above 183 cm, but the probability is still relatively low given the distribution tail.

For Team 2, they survey a single man each day, which will give them a probability distribution similar to the men's height distribution in the population. This means that the odds of finding a man over 183 cm in height each day is the same as the probability of a single randomly selected man being over 183 cm, which should be roughly the same as the odds for the median selection in Team 1 given the population distribution shape.

Because the considerations for both teams are influenced by the same underlying distribution in terms of heights, it's reasonable to conclude that both teams' counts of days with heights greater than 183 cm will be approximately similar, with differences likely within a 5% range due to the law of large numbers.
