{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because they survey one man each day, and the probability of that individual being taller than 183 cm directly reflects the distribution of heights in the population.

For Team 1, they are surveying three men each day and counting only the days where the middle height among the three men is above 183 cm. Statistically, the probability that the middle height (the median of three men) is greater than 183 cm is generally lower than the probability of a single person's height being greater than 183 cm because the median tends to be closer to the population mean of 178 cm.

Therefore, Team 2's method is more straightforward and will likely yield a higher count of days where the surveyed man's height exceeds 183 cm.
