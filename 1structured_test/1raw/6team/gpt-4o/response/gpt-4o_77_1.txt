Based on the information provided, let's analyze the likelihoods:

1. **Team 1:**
   - Each day, Team 1 surveys three men and ranks them by height.
   - The middle man is the second-tallest in a group of three.
   - The probability distribution of heights in the population is symmetric around the average (178 cm).
   - For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, more than half of the surveyed heights need to be relatively tall.
   - Given that heights above and below 183 cm should be equally distributed and that height variation (standard deviation) will play a role, the middle man's height has slightly less than 50% likelihood of being above 183 cm.

2. **Team 2:**
   - Each day, Team 2 surveys one man.
   - The probability that any single man is taller than 183 cm is consistent.
   - Since the heights are symmetrically distributed around an average of 178 cm, there's also about a 50% chance that any given man would be taller than 183 cm.

Since the likelihood of the middle man in Team 1 being taller than 183 cm is slightly less than 50%, Team 2, which has a consistent 50% chance, should record more days with heights above 183 cm.
