{team: 2}

The key here is that when Team 1 randomly selects three men and looks at the middle height, this middle height is more likely to be closer to the median height of the population (which is 178 cm) than an individual randomly selected in the manner of Team 2. Because of this, the chance of the middle man's height being above 183 cm is likely lower than the chance of a randomly selected individual's height being above 183 cm.

Given that the distribution of men's heights is such that half are below and half are above 178 cm, about half of Team 2's surveys should record a height above 178 cm, and a lesser fraction above 183 cm, likely around the same region but not skewed by the selection condition imposed by Team 1 on the middle man's height.

Therefore, Team 2, surveying one man each day, will have a straightforward probability reflective of the population's height distribution. Since the middle height constraint affects Team 1's count, I assert that Team 2 will likely have more days where the surveyed height is more than 183 cm.
