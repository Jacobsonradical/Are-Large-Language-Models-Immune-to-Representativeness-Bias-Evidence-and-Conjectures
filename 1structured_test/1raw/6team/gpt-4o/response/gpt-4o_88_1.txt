{team: 1}

Team 1 is likely to record more days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. This is because picking the middle height out of three men increases the probability that this value is closer to the median of the population's height distribution. Given that the heights are symmetrically distributed around an average of 178 cm, it is more likely that the middle height from three picks is just slightly above the average rather than one randomly chosen individual. Thus, the likelihood of the middle height being above 183 cm is higher.

In Team 2's case, each height sampled is completely independent and the probability of any one person being taller than 183 cm remains the same every day. The chance of consistently finding taller men is lower compared to the combined probabilistic advantage seen in Team 1â€™s method of selecting the middle height.
