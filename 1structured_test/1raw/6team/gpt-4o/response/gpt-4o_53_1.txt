{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

Team 2's approach simply counts how many men are above 183 cm, and since the heights of men are evenly distributed around the average height of 178 cm, approximately 50% of the men will be taller than 183 cm. Therefore, on average, Team 2 will record a proportion of days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm as approximately 50%.

On the other hand, Team 1 surveys three men and takes the median height. For the median height to be greater than 183 cm, at least two of the three surveyed men must be taller than 183 cm. Given that approximately 50% of men are taller than 183 cm, this situation (where the median height is above 183 cm) is less likely than just picking one man greater than 183 cm from a random sampling.

Therefore, Team 2 should record more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1 recording days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm.
