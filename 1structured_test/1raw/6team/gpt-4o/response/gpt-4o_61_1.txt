{team: 2}

Team 2 likely counted more such days because they are surveying individual men, and therefore, each man's height is an independent random variable. Since there is an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, approximately 50% of the men surveyed by Team 2 will have a height greater than 183 cm.

On the other hand, Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts a day only if the middle man's height exceeds 183 cm. The probability that the middle man (the second tallest in a random sample of three men) has a height exceeding 183 cm is lower than the probability of a single man exceeding 183 cm. This is because the height of the middle man is likely closer to the overall average due to the nature of ranking and the central limit theorem.

Thus, Team 2 is expected to count more days with a height exceeding 183 cm.
