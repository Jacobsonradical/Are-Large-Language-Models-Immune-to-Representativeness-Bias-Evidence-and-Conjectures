{team: 3} 

Here's the reasoning:

For Team 1, each day they survey three men and take the middle height. The probability that the middle height (median) of an odd number of randomly selected men is above 183 cm is close to the probability that a single randomly selected man's height is above 183 cm, due to the nature of the median, especially when the sample size is small.

For Team 2, they survey one man each day and check if his height is above 183 cm. Given that the probability of a single randomly selected man's height being above 183 cm is around 0.5 (since heights are normally distributed around the average with equal probability above and below the average), the number of days they record a height above 183 cm should be about half (0.5) of 365 days.

Therefore, on average, over 365 days, both teams should count a similar number of instances where the height is above 183 cm because the probability distributions involved are essentially the same. This leads to the conclusion that the counts will be within 5% of each other.
