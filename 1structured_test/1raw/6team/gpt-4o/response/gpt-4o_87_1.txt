{team: 3}

To explain, let's consider the statistical significance of the question. Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, there will be as many men above this height as below. Given the symmetry of the distribution, and assuming it follows a normal distribution, about 50% of men will have a height greater than 178 cm, and about 50% will have a height lesser than 178 cm.

Now, let's analyze each team's data collection strategy:

1. **Team 1** surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. The middle man's height will be greater than 183 cm if at least two out of the three men have heights greater than 183 cm. The probability that one randomly picked man has a height greater than 183 cm is less than 50% because 183 cm is significantly above the average height. 

   Using binomial distribution, we can say that for three men:
   - The probability of exactly two men being taller than 183 cm, and therefore making the middle man taller than 183 cm is a product of binomial coefficient and probabilities.

   However, this probability will still centralize around the tendency of a lesser fraction exceeding 183 cm height.

2. **Team 2** surveys one man each day. The probability that this one man is taller than 183 cm is straightforward and equally about less than 50%. Given these are independent events, over 365 days, the number of days observed where the height exceeds 183 cm would be relatively straightforward to calculate under binomial distribution, converging around the same figure as Team 1's result if treated repeatedly.

Since Team 1's requirement is more strict (depending on the rankings among three men) and Team 2's probability for each day is isolated, both teams are prone to record similar statistical outcomes around the height threshold of 183 cm within tolerable statistical deviation (around 5%).

Therefore, the two teams will count about the same number of days where the height condition is met within a 5% margin.
