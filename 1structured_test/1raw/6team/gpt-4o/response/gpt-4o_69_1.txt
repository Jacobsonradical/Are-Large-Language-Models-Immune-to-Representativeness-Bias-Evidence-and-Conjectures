{team: 2}

Explanation:
Each man in the population has an equal probability of being surveyed by either team. 

For Team 2, each day they randomly survey a single man. The probability that this man's height is greater than 183 cm is the same as the proportion of men in the population whose height is greater than 183 cm.

For Team 1, each day they survey three men and rank them by height. The middle man's height will be greater than 183 cm if and only if at least two out of the three men surveyed have heights greater than 183 cm. Since each selection is random, the selection of the middle man being above 183 cm from the group of three men is essentially choosing the median of the heights for these three men. 

Because the median requires two out of the three values to be greater than the threshold to count, the probability that the middle height is above 183 cm is less than the probability of randomly selecting a single man whose height is above 183 cm. 

Therefore, Team 2 is expected to record more days where the height of the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm.
