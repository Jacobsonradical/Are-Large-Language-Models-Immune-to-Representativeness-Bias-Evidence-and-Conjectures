{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to count more days where the height of the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 checks the height of one man each day directly against the threshold. 

For Team 1, even though they survey three men each day, they are interested only in the height of the middle-ranked man. The probability that this middle man's height is above 183 cm is less than the probability that any single randomly chosen man's height is above 183 cm, because the middle height among three is subject to more stringent criteria (it needs to be greater than the threshold *and* fall in the middle of three heights, not just greater than the threshold).

Since the average height is 178 cm and heights are presumably normally distributed around this average, only a portion of the population will be above 183 cm. Given that both teams have 365 opportunities, Team 2 will consistently check against an individual threshold, making it more likely to count more days with heights above 183 cm. Thus, Team 2's counts will be higher.
