{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the surveyed manâ€™s height exceeded 183 cm. This is because each member of the population has the same likelihood of being above or below 183 cm, and Team 2 directly counts this every day. 

Team 1, on the other hand, ranks the heights of three men and only counts the days where the middle height exceeds 183 cm. For the middle man's height to be above 183 cm, at least two of the three men surveyed need to have heights above 183 cm, which is less probable compared to assessing a single man. Therefore, Team 2 would likely record more such days.
