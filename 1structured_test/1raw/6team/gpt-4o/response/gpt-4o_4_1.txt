{team: 2}

Here’s the reasoning:

- **Team 1** surveys and ranks three men each day. The probability that the middle man (the median height) out of the three will be taller than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights. Given that the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is likely symmetric, each man has a roughly 50% chance of being above or below 178 cm. The probability that at least two out of the three men surveyed are each taller than 183 cm is lower than finding at least one man taller than 183 cm.

- **Team 2** surveys one man each day, and given the height distribution, each man has the same independent probability of being taller than 183 cm (which is typically less than 50%, assuming a symmetric distribution around the mean of 178 cm).

Given the survey setup, Team 2's daily chances rest on the straightforward probability distribution of each man’s height. Team 1's chances get complicated with having to randomly select three men and having the median height among them be over 183 cm, which reduces the effective chances of meeting their criteria when compared to the straightforward sampling of Team 2.

Thus, Team 2 is likely to record more days where a surveyed man's height is taller than 183 cm.
