{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to count more days on which the height of the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm. Here's why:

- The height of men in the population follows a normal distribution centered around 178 cm.
- For Team 1, each day they look at three men and select the middle height. The middle height is likely closer to the average height of the population compared to a randomly selected individual. The chance of the middle value being significantly above the average (183 cm in this case) is lower than that of a single randomly selected man.
- Team 2, by surveying one man each day, directly measures the chance of a man being taller than 183 cm based on the distribution of heights. Since height is normally distributed, about half of the days will have heights above and below the average, and the proportion above 183 cm would follow the tail of the distribution more truly. Thus, Team 2 is directly sampling from the height distribution's tail, which includes heights above 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely capturing more days with heights above 183 cm.
