{team: 3}

Both teams are sampling from the same population in which the distribution of heights is symmetrical around the average height of 178 cm. Given that 183 cm is above the average, approximately half of the surveyed heights will be more than 183 cm.

Team 1 is selecting three men each day and then ranks them by height. The height of the middle man in a group of three should still be a relatively random representative of the population height distribution, although slightly more likely to be closer to the middle of the distribution compared to a completely random selection of single individuals as done by Team 2.

Therefore, while there might be minor differences in the data distributions due to the different sampling methods, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm over many samples should be approximately the same for both teams. Hence, Team 1 and Team 2 are likely to count a similar number of such days within a margin of 5%.
