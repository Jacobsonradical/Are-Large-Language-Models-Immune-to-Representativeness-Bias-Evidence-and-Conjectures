{team: 3}

Both teams are conducting surveys with a random selection of men from the same population, and they are observing whether a randomly selected man's height (or the middle man from a set of three) exceeds 183 cm. The probability of a randomly selected man's height exceeding 183 cm is the same regardless of whether the selection is done individually or in groups of three.

For Team 1, the middle man's height in a random selection of three men should, on average, follow the same underlying height distribution as any single man's height in the population. Consequently, the frequency of the middle man being taller than 183 cm should be similar to the frequency of any individual man being taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, over a large number of days (365 days in this case), the number of days where the middle man from Team 1's survey is taller than 183 cm should be approximately the same as the number of days where the man surveyed by Team 2 is taller than 183 cm. The difference should be within a 5% margin, hence both teams should count about the same number of such days.
