{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning behind this conclusion:

Each day, Team 1 randomly selects three men and ranks them by height. The height of the middle man (the second tallest) is used for their count. Given that the average height is 178 cm, we know the distribution of heights around this average is symmetrical, with 50% of men above 178 cm and 50% below.

Team 2 simply surveys one man each day and checks if he is taller than 183 cm.

Let's consider the probability distributions for both scenarios:

1. **Team 1** (selecting three men and taking the middle height):
   - To determine if the middle man's height is above 183 cm, we need to consider the joint probability distributions of the three men.
   - Statistically, the middle man’s height when sampled from a population with a known distribution (normally distributed around 178 cm with a symmetric property) should have the same probability as a single randomly selected man being above 183 cm, assuming independence.

2. **Team 2** (selecting one man):
   - The probability that a randomly selected man's height is above 183 cm is directly given, without needing to rank or compare with others.

Since both teams are essentially sampling from the same distribution, and the probability of a single man’s height being above 183 cm is unaffected by how many individuals are sampled daily, Team 2’s count should have a more direct and unbiased reflection of the height distribution. Team 2’s process is simpler and less subject to additional variability that might come with the ranking process.

Thus, it is reasonable to assume that Team 2 will count more such days where the height is above 183 cm, as their measure of success doesn't rely on additional sampling dependencies.
