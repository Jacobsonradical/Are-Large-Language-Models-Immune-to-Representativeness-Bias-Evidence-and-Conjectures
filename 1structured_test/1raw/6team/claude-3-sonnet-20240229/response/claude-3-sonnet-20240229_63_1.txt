To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them based on height.
- They count the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- They count the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height above 183 cm is the same as the probability of having a height below 173 cm (178 - 5).

Let's call this probability p.

For Team 1:
The probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm is proportional to the probability of selecting two men with heights less than 183 cm (probability = p^2) and one man with height more than 183 cm (probability = 1 - p). This probability is 3p^2(1 - p).

For Team 2:
The probability of selecting a man with height more than 183 cm is simply p.

Since p is the same for both teams, and 3p^2(1 - p) is a decreasing function of p for p > 1/3, the value of 3p^2(1 - p) is likely to be less than p for the given scenario (where p is expected to be less than 0.5).

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with a man's height over 183 cm compared to Team 1.
