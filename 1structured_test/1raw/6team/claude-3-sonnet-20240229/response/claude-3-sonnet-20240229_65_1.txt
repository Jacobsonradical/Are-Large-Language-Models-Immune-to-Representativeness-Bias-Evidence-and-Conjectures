To answer this question, let's consider the following information:

- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Given that the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric around the mean, we can assume that the probability of a man's height being greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.5 (50%).

For Team 1:
- On each day, they survey three men.
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is the probability of having at least one man with a height greater than 183 cm, which is 1 - (0.5)^3 = 0.875 (87.5%).

For Team 2:
- On each day, they survey one man.
- The probability that the man's height is greater than 183 cm is 0.5 (50%).

Since Team 1 has a higher probability (87.5%) of counting a day as having a middle man's height greater than 183 cm compared to Team 2's probability (50%), we can expect that Team 1 will likely count more days overall.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 1}
