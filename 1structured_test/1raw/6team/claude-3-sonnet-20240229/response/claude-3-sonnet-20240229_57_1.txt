To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and compare the chances of each team recording a height greater than 183 cm.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is greater than 183 cm.

Assumptions:
- The heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.
- The heights are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).

For Team 1:
The probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm depends on the probability of drawing three men from the population and having the middle value greater than 183 cm. This probability is difficult to calculate analytically but can be approximated using simulations or numerical methods.

For Team 2:
The probability of surveying a man with a height greater than 183 cm is simply the area under the normal curve to the right of 183 cm, given the mean of 178 cm. This probability can be calculated using the standard normal distribution table or appropriate statistical software.

Without performing detailed calculations or simulations, it is reasonable to assume that Team 2 is more likely to record more days with a height greater than 183 cm since they are sampling from the entire population each day, while Team 1 is restricted to the middle value of three randomly sampled heights.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
