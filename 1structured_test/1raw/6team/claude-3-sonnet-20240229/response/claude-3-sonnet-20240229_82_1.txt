To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Each day, they survey 3 men randomly from the population.
- They rank the 3 men based on their height.
- They count the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Each day, they survey 1 man randomly from the population.
- They count the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, we can assume that the height distribution is approximately symmetric around 178 cm.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm depends on the heights of all three men surveyed. This probability will be higher than the probability of a single man's height being more than 183 cm (as in Team 2's case).

For Team 2, the probability of the man's height being more than 183 cm is simply the probability of a random man from the population having a height greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 1 is likely to count more days with the middle man's height being more than 183 cm compared to Team 2 counting days with a single man's height being more than 183 cm.
