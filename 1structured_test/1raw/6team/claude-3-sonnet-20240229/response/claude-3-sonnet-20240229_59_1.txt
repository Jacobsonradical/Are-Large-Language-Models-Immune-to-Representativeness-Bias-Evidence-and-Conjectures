To answer this question, we need to analyze the probability distributions of the two teams' survey methods.

{team: 2}

For Team 2, each day they survey one man from the population. Given that the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5 (assuming a normal distribution of heights).

For Team 1, each day they survey three men from the population and rank them by height. The probability of the middle man having a height greater than 183 cm is higher than the probability for Team 2's method. This is because the middle man's height is the second-highest of the three men surveyed, and the probability of the second-highest value being greater than 183 cm is higher than the probability of a single random value being greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 recorded fewer days with a height greater than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
