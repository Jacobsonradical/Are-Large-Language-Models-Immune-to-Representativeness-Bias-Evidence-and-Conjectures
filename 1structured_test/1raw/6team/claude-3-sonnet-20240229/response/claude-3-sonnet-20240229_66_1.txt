To answer this question, we need to understand the distribution of heights in the population and how the two teams are sampling from this distribution.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys three men randomly each day.
- Ranks the three men based on their height.
- Counts the number of days when the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys one man randomly each day.
- Counts the number of days when the height of the man is more than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, we can assume that the heights follow a symmetric distribution around 178 cm.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of a single randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm (as done by Team 2). This is because Team 1 selects the middle height out of three random heights, which increases the likelihood of being above 183 cm.

Therefore, we can expect Team 1 to count more days with the middle man's height being above 183 cm compared to Team 2.
