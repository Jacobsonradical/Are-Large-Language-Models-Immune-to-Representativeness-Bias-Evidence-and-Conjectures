To solve this problem, let's consider the following:

1. The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
2. The distribution of heights is symmetrical around the mean, with an equal number of men above and below the average height.
3. Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm.
4. Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is above 183 cm.

Given the symmetrical distribution of heights around the mean, we can assume that the probability of a randomly selected man having a height above 183 cm is the same as the probability of having a height below 183 cm.

For Team 1, when they survey three men, the probability of the middle man having a height above 183 cm is higher than the probability of a single man having a height above 183 cm (as in the case of Team 2). This is because the middle man is chosen from the taller two out of the three men surveyed.

Therefore, Team 1 is likely to have counted more days with the middle man's height above 183 cm compared to Team 2, who counted days with a single man's height above 183 cm.
