To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of selecting men with height greater than 183 cm in each team's survey method.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men with height above average as below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men randomly each day and ranks them by height.
- Team 1 counts the number of days when the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man randomly each day.
- Team 2 counts the number of days when the man's height is greater than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and the distribution of heights is symmetric around the average, we can assume that approximately half of the men in the population have a height greater than 183 cm.

For Team 1:
The probability of selecting at least one man with height greater than 183 cm in a group of three randomly selected men is 1 - (0.5)^3 = 0.875 or 87.5%.

For Team 2:
The probability of selecting a man with height greater than 183 cm is 0.5 or 50%.

Based on these probabilities, Team 1 is more likely to record a day with the middle man's height greater than 183 cm than Team 2 is to record a day with the surveyed man's height greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 1}
