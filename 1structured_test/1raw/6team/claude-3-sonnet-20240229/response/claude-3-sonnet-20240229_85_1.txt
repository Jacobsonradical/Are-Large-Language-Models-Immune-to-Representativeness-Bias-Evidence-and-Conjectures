To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm for each team's survey method.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them by height.
- For the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men must be taller than 183 cm.
- Let's assume that the heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.
- The probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.3 (based on the standard normal distribution).
- The probability of at least two out of three randomly selected men being taller than 183 cm is 0.3^3 + 3 * 0.3^2 * (1 - 0.3) â‰ˆ 0.189.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- The probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.3.

Since the probability of observing a man taller than 183 cm is higher for Team 2 (0.3) compared to Team 1 (0.189), it is likely that Team 2 counted more days with a height greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
