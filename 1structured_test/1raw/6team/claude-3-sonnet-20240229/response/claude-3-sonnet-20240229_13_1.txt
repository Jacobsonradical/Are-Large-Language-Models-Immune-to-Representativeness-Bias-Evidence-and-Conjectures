To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and make some assumptions.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as below average.
- Team 1 surveys 3 men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys 1 man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is above 183 cm.

Assumptions:
- The heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.
- The heights of the men surveyed each day are independent and randomly selected from the population.

Let's first calculate the probability that a randomly selected man's height is above 183 cm.
Since the distribution is assumed to be normal, we can use the standard normal distribution table or calculator.

The z-score for 183 cm is: (183 - 178) / σ = 5 / σ (where σ is the standard deviation of the distribution)

For a normal distribution, the area under the curve for z-scores greater than 1.645 is approximately 0.05 (5%).
This means that if σ = 5/1.645 ≈ 3.04 cm, then approximately 5% of men have a height above 183 cm.

Now, let's analyze the two teams:

Team 1:
When Team 1 surveys 3 men each day, the probability that the middle man's height is above 183 cm is calculated as follows:
Probability of 1st man being above 183 cm × Probability of 2nd man being above 183 cm × Probability of 3rd man being below 183 cm
+ Probability of 1st man being below 183 cm × Probability of 2nd man being above 183 cm × Probability of 3rd man being above 183 cm
+ Probability of 1st man being above 183 cm × Probability of 2nd man being below 183 cm × Probability of 3rd man being above 183 cm
= 3 × (0.05)^2 × (0.95) = 0.007125 or 0.7125%

Team 2:
For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man with a height above 183 cm is simply 0.05 or 5%.

Comparing the probabilities, Team 2 has a higher probability of finding a man with a height above 183 cm on any given day.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
