To answer this question, I will consider the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm for each team's survey method.

For Team 1:
- Each day, they survey 3 men randomly.
- The middle man's height will be greater than 183 cm if at least 2 out of the 3 men surveyed are taller than 183 cm.
- Let's assume the heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.
- The probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is approximately the area under the normal curve to the right of 183 cm, which is around 0.3.
- The probability of selecting 2 or 3 men taller than 183 cm out of 3 is: (0.3^2 * 0.7) + (0.3^3) â‰ˆ 0.189.
- So, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm on any given day is around 0.189.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they survey 1 man randomly.
- The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is simply 0.3.

Since the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm for Team 1 (0.189) is less than the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm for Team 2 (0.3), we can expect Team 2 to have counted more days with a man taller than 183 cm over the 365-day period.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
