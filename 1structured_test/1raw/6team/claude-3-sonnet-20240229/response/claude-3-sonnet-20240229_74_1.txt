To answer this question, let's consider the following:

1. The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
2. There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
3. Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
4. Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, we can assume that the distribution of heights is approximately symmetric around 178 cm.

For Team 1, when they survey three men, the middle man's height will tend to be closer to the average height (178 cm) due to the symmetry of the distribution. Therefore, the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm is relatively low.

For Team 2, they are surveying a single man each day. Since the distribution is symmetric around 178 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man's height being more than 183 cm is higher than the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm for Team 1.

Based on this reasoning, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with a man's height being taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
