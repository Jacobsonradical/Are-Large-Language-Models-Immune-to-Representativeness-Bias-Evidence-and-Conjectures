To answer this question, let's consider the following:

1. The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
2. Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.
3. Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the height of the man is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, we can assume that the height distribution is approximately symmetric around 178 cm.

For Team 1, when they survey three men each day, the probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights in the population. However, since the distribution is symmetric around the average, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm should be smaller than the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm (which is what Team 2 is counting).

For Team 2, they are simply counting the number of days when the height of the single man they surveyed is greater than 183 cm, which should be higher than the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm in Team 1's case.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 counted more days with a height greater than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
