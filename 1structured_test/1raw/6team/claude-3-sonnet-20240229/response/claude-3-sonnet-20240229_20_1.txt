To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved for each team.

For Team 1:
- On each day, they survey three men randomly from the population.
- The height of men in the population is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 178 cm.
- Since there are as many men above the average height as below, the median height is also 178 cm.
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is the probability that two out of the three randomly selected men have heights greater than 183 cm.
- This probability can be calculated using the standard normal distribution, but it is not straightforward.

For Team 2:
- On each day, they survey one man randomly from the population.
- The probability that the man's height is greater than 183 cm is simply the area under the normal curve to the right of 183 cm.
- This probability can be easily calculated using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator.

Given the information provided, it is easier to calculate the probability for Team 2, and it is likely to be higher than the probability for Team 1 (since Team 1 requires two out of three men to be above 183 cm).

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
