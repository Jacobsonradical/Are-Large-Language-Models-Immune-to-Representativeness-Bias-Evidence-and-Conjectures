To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved for each team.

For Team 1:
- They survey 3 men each day and rank them by height.
- The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights in the population.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, we can assume that the heights are approximately normally distributed.
- For a normal distribution, the probability of a randomly selected value being above a certain value (183 cm in this case) is less than 0.5.

For Team 2:
- They survey 1 man each day.
- The probability of the man being taller than 183 cm is also less than 0.5, since the average height is 178 cm.

Since Team 1 is essentially performing three independent trials each day (selecting three men), the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm on any given day is higher than the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm (as in Team 2's case).

Therefore, we can expect Team 1 to record more days with the middle man being taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2.
