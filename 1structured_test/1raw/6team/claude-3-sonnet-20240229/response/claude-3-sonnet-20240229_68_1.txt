To answer this question, we need to understand the probabilities involved in each team's survey process.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- The distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean (as many men above average as below average).
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is above 183 cm.

For Team 1:
- The probability of selecting a man with height above 183 cm is 0.5 (since the distribution is symmetric).
- The probability of the middle man being above 183 cm is the probability of getting at least two men above 183 cm, which is 0.5^3 + 3(0.5^2)(0.5) = 0.375.

For Team 2:
- The probability of selecting a man with height above 183 cm is 0.5.

Since Team 1 has a lower probability (0.375) of counting a day as above 183 cm compared to Team 2 (0.5), we can expect Team 2 to record more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
