To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three randomly selected men each day.
- They rank the three men based on their height.
- They count the number of days when the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They survey one randomly selected man each day.
- They count the number of days when the height of the man is more than 183 cm.

Since the distribution of heights is symmetric around the mean (178 cm), and the mean is less than 183 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man having a height greater than 183 cm is higher than the probability for a single randomly selected man (as in Team 2's case). This is because, in Team 1's case, the middle man is the second tallest out of three randomly selected men.

Therefore, Team 1 is likely to have counted more days with the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm compared to Team 2 counting the number of days with a single randomly selected man's height being greater than 183 cm.
