To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability distributions of the heights of the men surveyed by each team.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- Each day they survey three men randomly from the population.
- They count the number of days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- Each day they survey one man randomly from the population.
- They count the number of days where the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the heights of men in the population are assumed to be symmetrically distributed around the average of 178 cm, the probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

However, for Team 1, the probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm is higher than the probability of a single man's height being greater than 183 cm for Team 2. This is because Team 1 selects three men each day, and the middle man's height is likely to be closer to the average height than the heights of the extreme men.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Team 1 counted more days where the middle man's height was greater than 183 cm compared to Team 2, who counted days where a single man's height was greater than 183 cm.
