To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, we can assume that the heights of men follow a symmetric distribution around 178 cm.

For Team 1:
- The probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5 (since the average is 178 cm).
- When three men are randomly selected, the probability of the middle man (after ranking) having a height greater than 183 cm is lower than the individual probability.

For Team 2:
- The probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5 but higher than the probability for the middle man in Team 1's case.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with a man's height greater than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
