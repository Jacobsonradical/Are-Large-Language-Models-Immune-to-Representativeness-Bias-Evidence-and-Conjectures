To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions of the heights of the men surveyed by each team, and then compare the probabilities of obtaining a height greater than 183 cm.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men randomly each day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 surveys one man randomly each day.

Assuming the heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm, the probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.3085 (using a standard normal distribution table or calculator).

For Team 1:
The probability of having the middle man's height greater than 183 cm is the probability of having at least two out of the three men with heights greater than 183 cm, which is given by:
P(middle man's height > 183 cm) = 3 × (0.3085)^2 × (1 - 0.3085) + (0.3085)^3 ≈ 0.2283

For Team 2:
The probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm is simply 0.3085.

Since the probability for Team 1 (0.2283) is lower than the probability for Team 2 (0.3085), Team 2 is expected to count more days with a height greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
