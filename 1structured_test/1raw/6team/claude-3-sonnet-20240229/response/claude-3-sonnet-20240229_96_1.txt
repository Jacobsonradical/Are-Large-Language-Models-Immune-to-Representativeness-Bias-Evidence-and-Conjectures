To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of selecting a man with height above 183 cm in each team's survey method.

{team: 2}

For Team 1, they survey three men randomly each day and rank them based on their height. The probability of the middle man having a height greater than 183 cm is not straightforward to calculate since it depends on the distribution of heights in the population.

However, for Team 2, since they survey only one man randomly each day, the probability of that man having a height greater than 183 cm is simply the proportion of men in the population whose height exceeds 183 cm.

Given that the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the distribution of heights is approximately symmetric around the mean of 178 cm.

Therefore, the proportion of men with height greater than 183 cm is likely to be higher than the proportion of men with height greater than the middle man's height in Team 1's survey (which would be around 50%).

As a result, Team 2 is expected to count more days with a man's height exceeding 183 cm compared to Team 1.
