To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved for each team's survey method.

{team: 3}

For Team 1, who surveys three men each day and ranks them by height, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.5. This is because the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above the average as below. So, on any given day, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is roughly 0.5.

For Team 2, who surveys only one man each day, the probability of that man being taller than 183 cm is also approximately 0.5, as the height distribution is symmetric around the average of 178 cm.

Since both teams have the same probability of observing a man taller than 183 cm on any given day (0.5), and they are surveying for the same number of days (365), the expected number of days on which they observe a man taller than 183 cm should be roughly the same (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, my answer is that the two teams are likely to record about the same number of days with a height above 183 cm, within a 5% margin.
