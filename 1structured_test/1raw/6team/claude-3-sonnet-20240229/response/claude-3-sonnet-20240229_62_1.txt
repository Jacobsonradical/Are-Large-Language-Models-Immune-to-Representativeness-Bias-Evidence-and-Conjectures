To answer this question, let's consider the following:

1. The average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men above and below the average height.
2. Team 1 surveys 3 men each day and counts the number of days the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm.
3. Team 2 surveys 1 man each day and counts the number of days the man's height is greater than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men above and below the average, we can assume that the distribution of heights is roughly symmetric around the mean.

For Team 1, they are essentially sampling from the top half of the height distribution each day (since they are looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm). The probability of this happening is higher than the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm, which is what Team 2 is counting.

Therefore, it is likely that Team 1 will record more days with a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2.
