To answer this question, let's analyze the probability of each team recording a height greater than 183 cm on a given day.

For Team 1:
- On each day, they survey three men randomly from the population.
- The height of the middle man (after ranking) represents the median height of the three men surveyed.
- Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the median height is likely to be close to 178 cm.
- Therefore, the probability of the median height being greater than 183 cm is relatively low.

For Team 2:
- On each day, they survey one man randomly from the population.
- Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.5 (assuming a normal distribution of heights).

Based on this analysis, it is more likely that Team 2 recorded more days with a height greater than 183 cm than Team 1.
