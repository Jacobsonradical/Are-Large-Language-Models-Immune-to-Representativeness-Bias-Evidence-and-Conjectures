To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and compare them for the two teams.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm.
- Team 2 randomly surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is above 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and the distribution is symmetric around the average, we can assume that the heights of men follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.

For Team 1:
The probability of the middle man's height being above 183 cm is equal to the probability of two out of three randomly selected men having a height greater than 183 cm. This probability can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution.

For Team 2:
The probability of a randomly selected man's height being above 183 cm is simply the area under the normal curve to the right of 183 cm, which can also be calculated using the CDF of the normal distribution.

Without knowing the exact standard deviation of the height distribution, it is difficult to calculate the precise probabilities. However, we can make a reasonable comparison based on the given information.

Since Team 1 is counting the days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm, which requires two out of three men to have a height greater than 183 cm, the probability for Team 1 will be lower than the probability for Team 2, which only requires one man's height to be above 183 cm.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Team 2 recorded more days with a man's height above 183 cm compared to Team 1.
