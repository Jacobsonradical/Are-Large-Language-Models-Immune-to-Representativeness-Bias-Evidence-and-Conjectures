To answer this question, let's first consider the probability distributions involved.

For Team 1:
- They survey 3 men randomly each day.
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is the probability of getting one value above 183 cm and two values below or equal to 183 cm, or the probability of getting two values above 183 cm and one value below or equal to 183 cm.
- Assuming the heights of men are normally distributed with a mean of 178 cm, the probability of a man's height being greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.25 (since 183 cm is about 1 standard deviation above the mean).
- Therefore, the probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.25^2 * 0.75 + 0.25 * 0.75^2 = 0.1875 + 0.1875 = 0.375.

For Team 2:
- They survey 1 man randomly each day.
- The probability that the man's height is greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.25.

Since Team 1 has a higher probability of observing a height greater than 183 cm each day (0.375 vs. 0.25), they are likely to count more such days over the period of 365 days.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 1}
