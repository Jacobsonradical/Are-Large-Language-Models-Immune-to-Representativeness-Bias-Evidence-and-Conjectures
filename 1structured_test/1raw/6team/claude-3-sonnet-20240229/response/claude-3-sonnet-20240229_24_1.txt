To answer this question, let's analyze the scenarios for both teams:

Team 1:
- Each day, they survey 3 men randomly from the population.
- They rank the men based on their heights.
- They count the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of randomly selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

Team 2:
- Each day, they survey 1 man randomly from the population.
- They count the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

The probability of randomly selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm is also less than 0.5, but it is higher than the probability of selecting the middle man with a height greater than 183 cm for Team 1.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 counted more days with men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
