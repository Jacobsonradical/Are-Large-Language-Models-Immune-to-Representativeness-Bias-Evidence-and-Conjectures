To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved.

For Team 1:
- They survey 3 men each day and rank them by height.
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is the probability that at least one man is taller than 183 cm, and at least one man is shorter than 183 cm.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is roughly 0.5.
- The probability of getting at least one man taller than 183 cm and at least one man shorter than 183 cm when selecting 3 men is 0.75 (1 - 0.5^3 - 0.5^3).

For Team 2:
- They survey 1 man each day.
- The probability that the man's height is greater than 183 cm is roughly 0.5.

Since Team 1 has a higher probability (0.75) of recording a day where the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm compared to Team 2's probability (0.5), we can expect Team 1 to record more such days over the period of 365 days.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 1}
