To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men randomly each day.
- They count the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is 0.5 (since there are as many men above average as below average).
- The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.125 (since all three men need to be taller than 183 cm, and the order doesn't matter).

For Team 2:
- They survey one man randomly each day.
- They count the number of days when the man's height is taller than 183 cm.
- The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is 0.5.

Since Team 1 has a lower probability (0.125) of counting a day compared to Team 2 (0.5), we can expect Team 2 to count more days on average.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
