To answer this question, I need to understand the probabilities involved.

Given information:
- Average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men above average height as below average height.
- Team 1 surveys 3 men randomly each day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 surveys 1 man randomly each day.
- Both teams count the number of days when the height of the surveyed man(s) is above 183 cm.

For Team 1:
- The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is the probability that at least one of the other two men is shorter than 183 cm.
- Assuming heights are normally distributed around the average, this probability is relatively high.

For Team 2:
- The probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is the probability of randomly selecting a man taller than 183 cm from the population.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, this probability is relatively low.

Based on the given information, it is likely that Team 1 recorded more days with the middle man being taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2 recording a single man taller than 183 cm.

{team: 1}
