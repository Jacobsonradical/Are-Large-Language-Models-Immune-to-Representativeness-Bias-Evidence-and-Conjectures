To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distribution of heights in the population and how it relates to the tasks performed by the two teams.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Assumptions:
- The heights of men in the population follow a symmetric distribution around the mean of 178 cm.
- The selection of men for each survey is random and independent of previous selections.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm depends on the probability of picking three men with heights in a specific order. This probability calculation can be complex and depends on the exact distribution of heights.

For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is simply the probability that a randomly selected man's height is greater than 183 cm. Since the distribution is symmetric around the mean of 178 cm, and 183 cm is 5 cm above the mean, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.5 (assuming a normal distribution).

Over 365 days, Team 2 is expected to count around 0.5 Ã— 365 = 182.5 days where the man's height is taller than 183 cm.

Comparing the two teams, it is difficult to determine which team will count more days without knowing the exact probability distribution of heights. However, since Team 2's task is simpler and has a known probability, we can assume that their count will be close to the expected value of 182.5 days.

Therefore, the most reasonable answer is:

{team: 3}

This indicates that the two teams are likely to have counts within 5% of each other, assuming the heights follow a symmetric distribution around the mean.
