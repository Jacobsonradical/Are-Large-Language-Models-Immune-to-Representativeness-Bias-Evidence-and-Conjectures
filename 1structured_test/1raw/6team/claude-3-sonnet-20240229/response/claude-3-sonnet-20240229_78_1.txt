To answer this question, we need to consider the probability distributions involved in the two survey methods used by Team 1 and Team 2.

{team: 2}

For Team 2, since they survey only one man each day, the probability of recording a height above 183 cm is simply the probability that a randomly selected man from the population has a height greater than 183 cm. Given that the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above the average as below, we can assume that the distribution of heights is approximately symmetric around the mean. In this case, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm should be around 0.5 (or 50%).

For Team 1, the situation is more complex. They survey three men each day and record the number of days when the middle man (after ranking by height) is taller than 183 cm. The probability of this event depends on the joint distribution of the three randomly selected heights. While it is not straightforward to calculate the exact probability, we can make some observations:

1. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is less than the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm (which is around 0.5).
2. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is greater than the probability of all three men being taller than 183 cm (which is less than 0.5).

Therefore, the probability of Team 1 recording a day with the middle man taller than 183 cm is likely to be between 0.25 and 0.5.

Since Team 2 has a higher probability (around 0.5) of recording a day with a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1 (probability between 0.25 and 0.5), it is more likely that Team 2 counted more such days than Team 1.
