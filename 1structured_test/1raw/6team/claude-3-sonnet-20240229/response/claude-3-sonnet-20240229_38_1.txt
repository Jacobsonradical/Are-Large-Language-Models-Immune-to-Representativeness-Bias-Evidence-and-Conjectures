To answer this question, we need to consider the probability distribution of heights in the population and how the two teams' sampling methods interact with that distribution.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as below average.
- Team 1 surveys 3 men each day and counts the number of days where the middle man's height is above 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys 1 man each day and counts the number of days where the man's height is above 183 cm.

Assuming that the heights are symmetrically distributed around the mean of 178 cm, we can infer that the probability of a man's height being above 183 cm is approximately 0.5.

For Team 1:
- The probability of the middle man's height being above 183 cm is the sum of the probabilities of the three cases where exactly 1, 2, or 3 men have heights above 183 cm.
- This probability can be calculated using combinations and the probability of 0.5 for each man.
- The probability is approximately 0.375.

For Team 2:
- The probability of the man's height being above 183 cm is simply 0.5.

Since 0.5 is greater than 0.375, Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the surveyed man's height is above 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
