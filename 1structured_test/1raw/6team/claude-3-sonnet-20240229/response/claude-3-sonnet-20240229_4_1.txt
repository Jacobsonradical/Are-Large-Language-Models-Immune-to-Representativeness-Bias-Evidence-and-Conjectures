To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them by height.
- They count the number of days when the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- They count the number of days when the height of the man is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, we can assume that the height distribution is approximately symmetric around 178 cm.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm depends on the probability of selecting three men with heights such that the middle one is above 183 cm. This probability is likely to be lower than the probability of selecting a single man with a height above 183 cm, which is what Team 2 is counting.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 counted more days with heights above 183 cm than Team 1.
