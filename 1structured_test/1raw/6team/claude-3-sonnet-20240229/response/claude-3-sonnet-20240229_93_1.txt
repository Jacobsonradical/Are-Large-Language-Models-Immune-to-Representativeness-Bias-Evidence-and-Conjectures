To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and compare them for the two teams.

{team: 2}

Explanation:
1) For Team 1, each day they survey 3 men randomly from the population. The height of the middle man (after ranking) is the median of the 3 heights. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, the median height is also likely to be close to 178 cm.

2) For a normal distribution, the probability of a randomly selected value being greater than 183 cm (which is 5 cm above the average of 178 cm) is approximately 0.15 (or 15%).

3) For Team 1, the probability that the median of 3 randomly selected heights is greater than 183 cm is even lower than 0.15, as the median tends to be closer to the center of the distribution than the individual values.

4) For Team 2, since they survey only one man each day, the probability of the man's height being greater than 183 cm is simply 0.15 (or 15%).

5) Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have more days where the surveyed man's height is greater than 183 cm, compared to Team 1 having more days where the median height of the 3 surveyed men is greater than 183 cm.

Note: The exact probabilities depend on the specific distribution of heights in the population, but the general reasoning holds true for most reasonable distributions.
