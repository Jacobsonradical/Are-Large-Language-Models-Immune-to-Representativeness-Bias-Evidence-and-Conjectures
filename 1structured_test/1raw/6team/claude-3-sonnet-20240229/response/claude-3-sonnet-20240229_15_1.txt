To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of selecting a man whose height is greater than 183 cm in each team's survey method.

For Team 1:
- On each day, they survey three men randomly from the population.
- The height of the middle man (after ranking) is considered.
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights in the population.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, we can assume that the heights are approximately normally distributed.
- In a normal distribution, the probability of a value being greater than 183 cm (which is about 5 cm above the mean) is roughly 0.3.
- Therefore, the probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm on any given day is approximately 0.3.

For Team 2:
- On each day, they survey one man randomly from the population.
- The probability that the surveyed man's height is greater than 183 cm is also approximately 0.3 (assuming a normal distribution).

Since both teams have the same probability of observing a height greater than 183 cm on any given day, we can expect the total number of days on which they record such heights to be approximately the same over a period of 365 days.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 3}
