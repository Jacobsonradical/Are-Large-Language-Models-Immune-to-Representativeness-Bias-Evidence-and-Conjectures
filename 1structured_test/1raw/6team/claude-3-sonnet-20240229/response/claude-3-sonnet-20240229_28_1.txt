To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of observing a height greater than 183 cm for each team's sampling method.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them by height.
- The middle man's height is above 183 cm if at least one of the three men has a height greater than 183 cm.
- Assuming heights are normally distributed with a mean of 178 cm, the probability of a man having a height greater than 183 cm is around 0.3.
- The probability of at least one out of three men having a height greater than 183 cm is 1 - (0.7)^3 = 0.657 (approximately).

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- The probability of observing a height greater than 183 cm is simply 0.3 (based on the normal distribution assumption).

Since the probability of observing a height greater than 183 cm is higher for Team 1 (0.657) compared to Team 2 (0.3), we can expect Team 1 to count more such days over the 365-day period.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 1}
