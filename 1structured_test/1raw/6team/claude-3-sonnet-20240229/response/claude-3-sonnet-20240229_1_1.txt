To answer this question, let's consider the following:

1. The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
2. There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
3. Team 1 ranks three randomly selected men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm.
4. Team 2 selects one random man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is above 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, we can assume that the height distribution is roughly symmetric around 178 cm. This means that the probability of a randomly selected man having a height above 183 cm is the same for both teams.

However, Team 1 has a higher chance of counting a day as having a middle man's height above 183 cm because they are sampling three men each day and taking the middle value. This increases the likelihood of getting at least one man above 183 cm compared to Team 2's single sample.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 1}

Team 1 is likely to have counted more days with a height above 183 cm due to their sampling method of taking the middle value from three randomly selected men.
