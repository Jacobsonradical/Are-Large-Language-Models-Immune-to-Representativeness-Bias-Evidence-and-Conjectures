To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm.

Let's assume that the heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm and a standard deviation that we don't know.

For Team 1:
The probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm depends on the order statistics of the normal distribution. It is not straightforward to calculate this probability analytically.

For Team 2:
The probability of a randomly selected man's height being more than 183 cm is the area under the normal curve to the right of 183 cm. This probability can be calculated easily using standard normal distribution tables or functions.

Without knowing the standard deviation of the height distribution, it is difficult to compare the probabilities for the two teams quantitatively.

However, we can make a reasonable assumption that the probability of a randomly selected man's height being more than 183 cm (for Team 2) is higher than the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm (for Team 1) when three men are randomly selected.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
