To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved for each team.

For Team 1:
- They survey 3 men each day and rank them by height.
- The probability that the middle man's height is more than 183 cm is the probability that at least one of the men is taller than 183 cm and at least one is shorter than 183 cm.
- Since the height distribution is symmetric around the average of 178 cm, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a man being shorter than 173 cm (183 - 178 = 5, and 178 - 173 = 5).
- Let's call this probability p.
- The probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is then 3p^2 * (1-p) + p * (1-p)^2. (The first term accounts for the cases where the tallest and middle men are taller than 183 cm, and the second term accounts for the cases where the shortest and middle men are shorter than 183 cm.)

For Team 2:
- They survey only 1 man each day.
- The probability that the man's height is more than 183 cm is simply p.

Since p is the same for both teams, and the probability for Team 1 (3p^2 * (1-p) + p * (1-p)^2) is always greater than p for any value of p between 0 and 1, Team 1 will count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 1}
