To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm in each team's survey method.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm.
- Team 2 randomly surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is greater than 183 cm.

Assuming a normal distribution of heights, we can infer that approximately 50% of men in the population have a height greater than 178 cm (the average height).

For Team 1:
- The probability of selecting three men with heights greater than 183 cm is (0.5)^3 = 0.125 (12.5%).
- The probability of selecting two men with heights greater than 183 cm and one man with a height less than 183 cm is 3 × (0.5)^2 × (0.5) = 0.375 (37.5%).
- In both cases, the middle man's height will be greater than 183 cm.
- Therefore, the probability of counting a day as a successful day for Team 1 is 0.125 + 0.375 = 0.5 (50%).

For Team 2:
- The probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm is 0.5 (50%).
- This is the same probability as for Team 1.

Since the probabilities are the same for both teams, we can expect that the number of days counted by each team will be approximately the same (within 5% of each other) over a large sample size (365 days).
