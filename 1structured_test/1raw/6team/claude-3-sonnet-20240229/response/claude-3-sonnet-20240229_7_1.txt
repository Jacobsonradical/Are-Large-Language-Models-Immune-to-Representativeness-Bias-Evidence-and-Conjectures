To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and make some assumptions.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Assumptions:
- The heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.
- The heights of the men surveyed each day are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random samples from the population.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, we can assume that the distribution is symmetric around 178 cm.

For Team 1:
- The probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm is the probability that at least two of the three randomly chosen men have a height greater than 183 cm.
- This probability can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution.

For Team 2:
- The probability of the man's height being more than 183 cm is simply the probability that a randomly chosen man has a height greater than 183 cm.
- This probability can also be calculated using the CDF of the normal distribution.

Without knowing the exact standard deviation of the height distribution, it is difficult to calculate the exact probabilities. However, since the distribution is symmetric around 178 cm, and 183 cm is 5 cm above the mean, the probability for Team 2 is likely to be slightly higher than the probability for Team 1.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
