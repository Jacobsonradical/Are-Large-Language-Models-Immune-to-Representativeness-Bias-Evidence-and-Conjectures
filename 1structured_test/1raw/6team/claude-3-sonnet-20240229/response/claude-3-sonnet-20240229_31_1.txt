To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 randomly surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, we can assume that the heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.

For Team 1:
The probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm is the probability that two out of the three randomly selected men have a height greater than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
The probability of the man's height being more than 183 cm is simply the probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm.

Without knowing the exact standard deviation of the height distribution, it is difficult to calculate the exact probabilities. However, we can make a reasonable assumption that the heights are distributed symmetrically around the mean of 178 cm.

If we assume a symmetric distribution, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm (5 cm above the mean) is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man having a height less than 173 cm (5 cm below the mean).

Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm should be close to 0.5.

Therefore, the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm for Team 1 should be slightly lower than 0.5, while the probability for Team 2 should be close to 0.5.

Based on this analysis, we can expect that Team 2 recorded more days with a man's height taller than 183 cm than Team 1, but the difference may not be significant.
