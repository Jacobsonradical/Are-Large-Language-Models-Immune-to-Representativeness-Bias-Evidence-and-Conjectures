To solve this problem, we need to understand the probabilities involved in each team's survey method.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them based on their height.
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights in the population.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, we can assume that the heights are approximately normally distributed.
- In a normal distribution, the probability of a random value being greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.25 (25%).
- Therefore, on any given day, the probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.25 × 0.5 × 0.25 = 0.03125 (3.125%).

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- The probability that the man's height is greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.25 (25%).

Now, let's compare the expected number of days counted by each team:

Team 1:
- Expected number of days counted = 365 × 0.03125 ≈ 11.41 days

Team 2:
- Expected number of days counted = 365 × 0.25 ≈ 91.25 days

Since Team 2's expected count is significantly higher than Team 1's expected count, we can conclude that Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days with heights greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
