To answer this question, let's make the following assumptions:

1. The heights of men in the population are normally distributed around the mean of 178 cm.
2. The heights of the men surveyed each day are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random samples from the population.

Given these assumptions, we can calculate the probabilities involved and compare them for the two teams.

For Team 1:
- The probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.3085 (assuming a standard deviation of about 6 cm for adult male heights).
- The probability of getting at least one man out of three with a height greater than 183 cm is 1 - (0.6915)^3 = 0.6685.
- Therefore, on average, Team 1 would count about 0.6685 × 365 = 244 days with the middle man having a height greater than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- The probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm is 0.3085.
- Therefore, on average, Team 2 would count about 0.3085 × 365 = 112.6 days with the surveyed man having a height greater than 183 cm.

Comparing the two averages, we can see that Team 1 is expected to count more days with the middle man being taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 1}
