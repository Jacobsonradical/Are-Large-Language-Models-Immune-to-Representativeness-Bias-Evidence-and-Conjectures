To answer this question, let's analyze the probability of each team recording a height greater than 183 cm on any given day.

For Team 1:
- They survey 3 men each day and rank them by height.
- The middle man's height is recorded if it is greater than 183 cm.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men above and below the average, the probability of any randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5.
- However, by selecting the middle man out of 3 men, the probability of that man having a height greater than 183 cm increases.

For Team 2:
- They survey only 1 man each day.
- The probability of recording a height greater than 183 cm is simply the probability of randomly selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm, which is less than 0.5.

Based on this analysis, Team 1 is more likely to record more days with a height greater than 183 cm because they have a higher chance of selecting the middle man out of 3 men, who is likely to be taller than the average.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 1}
