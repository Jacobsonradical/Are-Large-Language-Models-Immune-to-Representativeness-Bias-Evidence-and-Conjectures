To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and compare them.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men with height above average as below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men randomly each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man randomly each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, we can assume that the heights follow a symmetric distribution around 178 cm.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm depends on the probability of selecting three men with at least two of them being taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a man's height being greater than 183 cm in the population.

Without knowing the specific distribution of heights, it is difficult to calculate the exact probabilities. However, we can make a reasonable guess based on the symmetry of the distribution.

If the distribution is symmetric around 178 cm, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm should be less than 0.5 (since 183 cm is 5 cm above the average). Therefore, the probability of selecting three men with at least two of them being taller than 183 cm (Team 1's case) should be lower than the probability of selecting one man taller than 183 cm (Team 2's case).

Therefore, the most likely answer is:

{team: 2}
