To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and compare them.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and the distribution is symmetric, we can assume that the heights of men follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.

For Team 1:
The probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm is the probability that at least two out of the three randomly selected men have heights greater than 183 cm. This probability can be calculated using the normal distribution.

For Team 2:
The probability of the man's height being more than 183 cm is simply the probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm, which can also be calculated using the normal distribution.

Without knowing the exact standard deviation of the height distribution, it's difficult to calculate the exact probabilities. However, we can make a reasonable assumption based on the given information.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that the standard deviation is relatively small. This means that the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is relatively low.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm is even lower than the probability for Team 2, as it requires at least two out of three men to have heights greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Team 2 recorded more days with the man's height being taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
