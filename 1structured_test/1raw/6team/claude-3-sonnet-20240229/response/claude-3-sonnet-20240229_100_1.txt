To answer this question, let's consider the probability distribution of heights in the population.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

This implies that the distribution of heights is approximately symmetric around the mean of 178 cm.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them by height.
- The event they count is when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- This event is more likely to occur when the distribution of heights is skewed towards the higher end.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- The event they count is when the man's height is more than 183 cm.
- This event is equally likely for any man in the population, regardless of the distribution shape.

Since the distribution of heights is approximately symmetric around the mean of 178 cm, Team 1 and Team 2 have roughly equal chances of counting more days when the height exceeds 183 cm.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 3}
