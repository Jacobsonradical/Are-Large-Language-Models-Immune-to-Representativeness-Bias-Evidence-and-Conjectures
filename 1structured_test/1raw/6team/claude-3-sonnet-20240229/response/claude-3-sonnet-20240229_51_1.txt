To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and compare them.

For Team 1:
- They survey 3 men each day and rank them by height.
- The event of interest is when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, we can assume that the heights follow a symmetric distribution around the mean.
- For the middle man to be above 183 cm, at least 2 out of the 3 men must be above 183 cm.
- The probability of a randomly chosen man being above 183 cm is less than 0.5 (since the average is 178 cm).
- Therefore, the probability of the middle man being above 183 cm is less than 0.5^2 = 0.25.

For Team 2:
- They survey 1 man each day.
- The event of interest is when the man's height is more than 183 cm.
- The probability of a randomly chosen man being above 183 cm is less than 0.5 (since the average is 178 cm).

Since the probability of the event of interest is higher for Team 2 (less than 0.5) than for Team 1 (less than 0.25), we can conclude that Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
