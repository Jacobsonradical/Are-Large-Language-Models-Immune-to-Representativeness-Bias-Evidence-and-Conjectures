To answer this question, let's consider the following:

1. The average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
2. Team 1 surveys three random men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm.
3. Team 2 surveys one random man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is greater than 183 cm.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights in the population. Since there are as many men above the average height as below, we can assume a roughly symmetric distribution around the mean of 178 cm.

For Team 2, the probability of the man's height being greater than 183 cm is simply the proportion of men in the population whose height exceeds 183 cm.

Given the symmetric distribution around the mean, the proportion of men taller than 183 cm (5 cm above the mean) is likely to be smaller than the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm when three men are sampled.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Team 1 would have counted more days with the middle man's height greater than 183 cm compared to Team 2 counting days with the single man's height greater than 183 cm.
