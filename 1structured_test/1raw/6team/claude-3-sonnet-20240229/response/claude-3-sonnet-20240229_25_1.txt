To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and make some assumptions.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is above 183 cm.

Assumptions:
- The heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.
- The heights of men are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables.

Let's first calculate the probability that a randomly selected man's height is greater than 183 cm.
Since the heights are normally distributed with a mean of 178 cm, we can use the standard normal distribution table or calculator to find this probability.

Standardizing (183 - 178) / σ, where σ is the standard deviation of the height distribution, and using the standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find the probability that a randomly selected man's height is greater than 183 cm.

Now, for Team 1:
The probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm is the probability that at least two out of the three randomly selected men have heights greater than 183 cm. This probability can be calculated using combinations and the probability obtained above.

For Team 2:
The probability of the surveyed man's height being greater than 183 cm is the same as the probability calculated above.

Comparing the probabilities for Team 1 and Team 2, we can determine which team is likely to have counted more such days.

{team: 3}

Without knowing the specific standard deviation of the height distribution, it is difficult to calculate the exact probabilities. However, based on the given information and assumptions, it is reasonable to expect that the probabilities for Team 1 and Team 2 are approximately equal or within 5% of each other, leading to a similar number of days counted by both teams.
