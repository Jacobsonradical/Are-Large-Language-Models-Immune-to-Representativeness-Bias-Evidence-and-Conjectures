To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved for each team's survey method.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them by height.
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is the probability that at least one man is taller than 183 cm, and at least one man is shorter than 183 cm.
- Assuming the heights of the men are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and the average height is 178 cm, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5, but greater than the probability for Team 2 (explained below).

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- The probability that the surveyed man's height is greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5, as the average height is 178 cm.

Since the probability for Team 1 is higher than that for Team 2, we can expect Team 1 to record more days where the surveyed man's height is greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 1}
