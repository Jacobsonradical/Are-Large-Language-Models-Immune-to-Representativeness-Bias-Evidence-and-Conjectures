To solve this problem, let's consider the following:

1. The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
2. There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
3. Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
4. Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

For Team 1, the probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm on a given day is higher than for Team 2, as they are selecting three men instead of one. However, Team 1 only counts the days when the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm, which reduces the number of days counted compared to Team 2.

For Team 2, the probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm on a given day is lower than for Team 1, but they count every day when the man's height is greater than 183 cm.

Considering these factors, it is reasonable to assume that the number of days counted by both teams would be similar, as the higher probability of selecting a taller man for Team 1 is offset by the requirement of the middle man being taller, while the lower probability for Team 2 is offset by counting every day when the man is taller.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 3}
