To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of selecting a man with height greater than 183 cm in both scenarios.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is greater than 183 cm.

Assuming that the heights of men follow a normal distribution, we can calculate the probability of selecting a man with height greater than 183 cm.

Let's denote the probability of selecting a man with height greater than 183 cm as p.

For Team 1:
The probability of selecting at least one man with height greater than 183 cm out of three men is 1 - (1 - p)^3.
The probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm is (1 - (1 - p)^3) / 3.

For Team 2:
The probability of selecting a man with height greater than 183 cm is p.

Since we don't have enough information to determine the value of p, we can compare the probabilities based on the assumption that p is small (less than 0.5).

If p is small, then (1 - (1 - p)^3) / 3 â‰ˆ p.

Therefore, both teams are expected to have approximately the same number of days when the surveyed man's height is greater than 183 cm.
