To solve this problem, we need to understand the underlying probability distributions of the heights of the surveyed men for each team.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men randomly each day and rank them by height.
- They count the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- The probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights in the population.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man randomly each day.
- They count the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.
- The probability of the man's height being more than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights in the population.

Since the distribution of heights is not specified, we cannot calculate the exact probabilities. However, we can make a reasonable assumption based on the given information.

Assuming that the heights follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm, and given that there are as many men above average as below average, we can infer that the distribution is roughly symmetric around the mean.

In this case, the probability of a randomly selected man's height being greater than 183 cm (which is 5 cm above the mean) would be approximately 0.3085 or 30.85%.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm would be higher than 30.85% since they rank the three men by height. However, the exact probability is difficult to calculate without knowing the specific distribution of heights.

For Team 2, the probability of a randomly selected man's height being greater than 183 cm is approximately 30.85%.

Based on this analysis, it is reasonable to assume that Team 1 recorded more days with the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm compared to Team 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 1}
