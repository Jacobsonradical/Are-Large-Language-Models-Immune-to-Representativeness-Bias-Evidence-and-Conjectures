To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and make some assumptions.

Let's assume that the heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm and a standard deviation of, say, 6 cm (this is a reasonable assumption based on the given information that there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average).

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them by height.
- The probability that the middle man (second-highest) has a height greater than 183 cm is the probability that at least two out of the three men have a height greater than 183 cm.
- This probability can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution.
- Let's call this probability P1.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- The probability that the man's height is greater than 183 cm is simply the complement of the CDF of the normal distribution evaluated at 183 cm.
- Let's call this probability P2.

Now, Team 1 counts the number of days out of 365 where the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm, which is approximately 365 × P1.

Team 2 counts the number of days out of 365 where the man's height is greater than 183 cm, which is approximately 365 × P2.

Since the normal distribution is symmetric about the mean, and 183 cm is higher than the mean of 178 cm, we can expect P1 to be smaller than P2.

Without specific calculations, it's difficult to determine whether the difference between 365 × P1 and 365 × P2 is within 5% of each other. However, based on the assumptions and the nature of the normal distribution, it is more likely that Team 2 recorded more days with heights greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
