To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability distributions of the heights of the men surveyed by each team.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the heights of men are symmetrically distributed around the mean of 178 cm, we can assume that the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.5.

For Team 1:
- The probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm is given by the combination of selecting one man with height > 183 cm and two men with height <= 183 cm, or two men with height > 183 cm and one man with height <= 183 cm.
- The probability of this event is (0.5)^3 + 3 * (0.5)^2 * (0.5) = 0.375

For Team 2:
- The probability of the surveyed man's height being greater than 183 cm is simply 0.5.

Since the probability for Team 1 (0.375) is lower than the probability for Team 2 (0.5), we can expect Team 2 to have counted more days with heights greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
