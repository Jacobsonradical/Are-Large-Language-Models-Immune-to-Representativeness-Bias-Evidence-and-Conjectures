To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of selecting a man whose height is greater than 183 cm in each team's survey method.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them based on height, counting the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric, we can assume that approximately 50% of men have a height greater than 183 cm.

For Team 1:
The probability of selecting three men, at least one of whom is taller than 183 cm, is given by:
P(at least one man > 183 cm) = 1 - P(all three men â‰¤ 183 cm)
= 1 - (0.5)^3
= 0.875

For Team 2:
The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is 0.5.

Since Team 1 has a higher probability of encountering a man taller than 183 cm on any given day, they are likely to count more such days over the 365-day period.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 1}
