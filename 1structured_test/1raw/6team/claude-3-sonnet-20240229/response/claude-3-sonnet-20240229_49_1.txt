To answer this question, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm in each team's survey method.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 randomly surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, we can assume that the distribution of heights is approximately symmetric around 178 cm.

For Team 1:
When selecting three random men, the probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights. However, we can expect this probability to be relatively low since 183 cm is well above the average height.

For Team 2:
The probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm is directly proportional to the fraction of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm. Since the distribution is symmetric around 178 cm, we can expect this fraction to be relatively small, but larger than the probability for Team 1.

Therefore, it is likely that Team 2 counted more days with a man's height greater than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
