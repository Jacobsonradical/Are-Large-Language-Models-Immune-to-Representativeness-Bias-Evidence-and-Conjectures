To answer this question, let's consider the following:

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and the distribution of heights is symmetric around the average, we can assume that approximately 50% of the men have a height greater than 183 cm.

For Team 1:
- On each day, they survey three men randomly.
- The probability that the middle man's height is more than 183 cm is (0.5)^3 + 3(0.5)^2(0.5) = 0.375 (assuming independence).

For Team 2:
- On each day, they survey one man randomly.
- The probability that the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm is 0.5.

Since Team 2 has a higher probability (0.5) of counting a day compared to Team 1 (0.375), we can expect Team 2 to have counted more days on average.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
