To answer this question, I need to understand the probability distributions involved.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- This implies that the distribution of heights is approximately symmetric around the mean of 178 cm.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men randomly each day.
- The probability that the middle man's height is more than 183 cm depends on the probability of drawing three men, with at least two of them having heights greater than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man randomly each day.
- The probability that the man's height is more than 183 cm depends on the probability of drawing a man with a height greater than 183 cm from the population.

Since the distribution of heights is symmetric around 178 cm, the probability of drawing a man with a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 1, the probability of drawing at least two men with heights greater than 183 cm is lower than the probability of drawing one man with a height greater than 183 cm (as in Team 2's case).

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 will count more days with a man's height taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1 counting days with the middle man's height taller than 183 cm.
