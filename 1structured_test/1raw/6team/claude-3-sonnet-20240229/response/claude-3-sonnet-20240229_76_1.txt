To answer this question, we need to consider the probability distributions involved in each team's survey method.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them by height.
- The probability that the middle man's height is more than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights in the population.
- Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below, we can assume a symmetric distribution around the mean.
- For the middle man's height to be more than 183 cm, at least two of the three men surveyed must have heights greater than 183 cm.
- The probability of this event is difficult to calculate precisely without knowing the exact distribution, but it is likely to be relatively low.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- The probability that the man's height is more than 183 cm depends on the proportion of men in the population whose height exceeds 183 cm.
- Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below, we can assume that roughly half of the men in the population have a height greater than 183 cm.
- Therefore, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.5 on any given day.

Based on these considerations, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a man taller than 183 cm, as their probability of observing this event is higher on each day.
