To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability distributions of the heights of men surveyed by each team.

For Team 1:
- Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below, the height distribution is likely symmetric around 178 cm.
- When surveying three men, the middle man's height is the median of the three heights.
- For a symmetric distribution, the probability that the median is greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2:
- Since they are surveying a single man each day, the probability that the man's height is greater than 183 cm is also less than 0.5.

However, Team 1 is surveying three men each day, so they have more opportunities to find a middle man with a height greater than 183 cm compared to Team 2, who surveys only one man per day.

Therefore, my answer is:
{team: 1}
