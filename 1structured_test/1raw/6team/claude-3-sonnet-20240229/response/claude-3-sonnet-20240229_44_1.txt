To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and make some assumptions about the heights in the population.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Assumptions:
- The heights of men in the population follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution with a mean of 178 cm.
- The standard deviation of the heights is not provided, but we can assume a reasonable value, say 6 cm.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men randomly each day.
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm depends on the distribution of the order statistics.
- For a normal distribution, the median of the order statistics is the middle value, which is the 50th percentile.
- If we assume a standard deviation of 6 cm, then the height corresponding to the 50th percentile is approximately 178 cm.
- Therefore, the probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man randomly each day.
- The probability that the man's height is greater than 183 cm is the area under the normal curve to the right of 183 cm.
- With a mean of 178 cm and a standard deviation of 6 cm, this probability is approximately 0.31.

Considering the probabilities involved, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with heights greater than 183 cm than Team 1.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
