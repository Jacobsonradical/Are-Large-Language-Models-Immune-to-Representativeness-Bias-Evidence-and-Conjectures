To solve this problem, let's make a few assumptions and calculations:

1. Given that the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, we can assume that the heights of men follow a symmetric distribution around 178 cm.

2. For Team 1, on any given day, the probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is the probability that at least two out of the three randomly selected men have heights greater than 183 cm.

3. If we assume a normal distribution for the heights, and since 183 cm is approximately 0.37 standard deviations above the mean of 178 cm, the probability that a randomly selected man's height is greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.355 (using a standard normal distribution table).

4. The probability that at least two out of three randomly selected men have heights greater than 183 cm is given by: 1 - (probability of 0 men above 183 cm) - (probability of 1 man above 183 cm) = 1 - (0.645)^3 - (3 * 0.645^2 * 0.355) â‰ˆ 0.329.

5. For Team 2, the probability that a randomly selected man's height is greater than 183 cm is simply 0.355.

Since the probability for Team 1 (0.329) is slightly lower than the probability for Team 2 (0.355), we can expect that Team 2 recorded more days with heights greater than 183 cm, but the difference may not be significant.

However, please note that this analysis assumes a normal distribution for the heights, which may not be entirely accurate in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the assumptions made about the distribution of heights above and below the average may not hold true in all cases.
