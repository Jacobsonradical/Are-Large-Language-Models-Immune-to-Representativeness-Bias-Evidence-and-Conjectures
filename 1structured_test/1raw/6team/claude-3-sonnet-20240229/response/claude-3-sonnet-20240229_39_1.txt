To answer this question, let's make a few assumptions and calculations:

1. The heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.
2. Since there are as many men above the average height as below, the distribution is symmetric about the mean.
3. The standard deviation (σ) of the height distribution is not given, but we can estimate it based on the information that the average height is around 178 cm.

Assuming that "around" means within 5 cm, we can take σ = 5 cm as a reasonable estimate.

With these assumptions, we can calculate the probability that a randomly selected man's height is greater than 183 cm:

P(height > 183 cm) = 1 - P(height ≤ 183 cm)
                   = 1 - Φ((183 - 178) / 5)
                   = 1 - Φ(1)
                   ≈ 0.159 (where Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution)

For Team 1:
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is 0.159 × 0.159 × 0.841 + 0.159 × 0.841 × 0.159 + 0.841 × 0.159 × 0.159 ≈ 0.268
- The expected number of days with the middle man's height greater than 183 cm is 0.268 × 365 ≈ 98 days

For Team 2:
- The probability that a randomly selected man's height is greater than 183 cm is 0.159
- The expected number of days with the man's height greater than 183 cm is 0.159 × 365 ≈ 58 days

Therefore, we expect Team 1 to record more days with the middle man's height greater than 183 cm compared to Team 2.
