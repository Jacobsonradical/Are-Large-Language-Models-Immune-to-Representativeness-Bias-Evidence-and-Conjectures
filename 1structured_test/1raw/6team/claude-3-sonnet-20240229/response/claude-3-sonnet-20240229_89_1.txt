To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm in each team's survey approach.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them by height.
- For the middle man's height to be greater than 183 cm, at least two of the three men must have a height greater than 183 cm.
- If the men's heights are independent and identically distributed (IID), the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is the same for all three men.
- Let's assume this probability is p.
- The probability of the middle man having a height greater than 183 cm is given by the sum of the probabilities of the following cases:
  1) All three men have a height greater than 183 cm: p^3
  2) Exactly two men have a height greater than 183 cm: 3p^2(1-p)

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- The probability of the surveyed man having a height greater than 183 cm is simply p.

Now, if p is greater than 0.5 (i.e., more men have a height greater than 183 cm), then Team 1 will likely record more days with the middle man's height greater than 183 cm compared to Team 2. However, if p is less than 0.5, Team 2 will likely record more such days.

Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, we can assume that p is close to 0.5.

In this case, the probabilities for Team 1 and Team 2 are likely to be close, and the difference in the number of days recorded by the two teams should be within 5% of each other.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 3}
