To answer this question, we need to consider the probabilities of selecting men taller than 183 cm in each team's survey method.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 randomly surveys one man each day.

For Team 1:
Let's assume that the heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm and a standard deviation that allows for a reasonable number of men taller than 183 cm.

The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm in a single random selection is less than 0.5 (since the average height is 178 cm).

However, when selecting three men and ranking them, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of a single random selection being taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm in a single random selection is the same as for Team 1's single random selection.

Considering the probabilities, it is likely that Team 1 recorded more days with the middle man being taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2's single random selections.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 1}
