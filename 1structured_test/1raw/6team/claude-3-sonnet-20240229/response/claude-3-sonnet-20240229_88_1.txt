To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm in each team's survey method.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them by height.
- They count the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is the same for each of the three men surveyed.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- They count the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.
- The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is the same as for Team 1.

Since the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams, and Team 1 surveys three men each day, it is more likely that Team 1 will have more days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm compared to Team 2, which surveys only one man each day.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 1}
