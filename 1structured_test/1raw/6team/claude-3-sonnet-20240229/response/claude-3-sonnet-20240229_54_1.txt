To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of observing a man taller than 183 cm in each team's survey method.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them based on height.
- They count the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm depends on the height distribution in the population.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- They count the number of days when the man's height is taller than 183 cm.
- The probability of observing a man taller than 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, and the average height is 178 cm, we can assume that the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is less than 50%.

In this case, Team 2 is more likely to observe more days with a man taller than 183 cm because they have more opportunities to sample from the population (365 opportunities compared to Team 1's smaller number of opportunities, which depends on the height distribution).

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
