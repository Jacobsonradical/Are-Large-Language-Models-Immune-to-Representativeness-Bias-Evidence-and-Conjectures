To answer this question, let's consider the following:

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men with height above average as below average.
- Team 1 surveys 3 men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys 1 man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is above 183 cm.

For Team 1, the probability of selecting a man with height above 183 cm is less than 0.5 because the average height is 178 cm. However, they are selecting 3 men each day, which increases the chances of having at least one man with height above 183 cm in the middle position.

For Team 2, the probability of selecting a man with height above 183 cm is also less than 0.5.

Since Team 1 is surveying more men each day, it is likely that they will count more days with the middle man's height above 183 cm compared to Team 2, who surveys only one man per day.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 1}
