To answer this question, let's consider the probability of a man's height being greater than 183 cm in each team's survey method.

For Team 1:
- They survey 3 men each day and rank them by height.
- For the middle man to have a height greater than 183 cm, at least 2 out of the 3 men must have a height greater than 183 cm.
- Assuming the heights of men are independent and identically distributed, and the average height is 178 cm, the probability of a man's height being greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5.
- The probability of at least 2 out of 3 men having a height greater than 183 cm is relatively low.

For Team 2:
- They survey 1 man each day.
- The probability of the surveyed man's height being greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5, but higher than the probability for Team 1.

Considering the above, it is likely that Team 2 recorded more days with a man's height greater than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
