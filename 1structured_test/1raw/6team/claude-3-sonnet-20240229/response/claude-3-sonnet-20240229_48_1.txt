To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them by height.
- They count the number of days when the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- They count the number of days when the height of the man is more than 183 cm.

Since the population is symmetric around the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.5.

For Team 1:
- The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is the probability of at least two out of the three randomly selected men being taller than 183 cm.
- This probability is given by: 1 - (0.5)^3 - 3(0.5)^2(0.5) = 0.375

For Team 2:
- The probability of the selected man being taller than 183 cm is simply 0.5.

Since Team 1 has a lower probability (0.375) of counting a day as meeting the criterion compared to Team 2 (0.5), we can expect Team 2 to count more such days on average.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
