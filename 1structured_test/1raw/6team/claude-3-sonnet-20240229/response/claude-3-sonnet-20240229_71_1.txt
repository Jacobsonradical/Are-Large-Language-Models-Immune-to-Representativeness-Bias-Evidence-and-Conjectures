To answer this question, we need to consider the probability distributions of the heights recorded by each team.

For Team 1:
- On each day, they survey 3 men randomly from the population.
- They rank the men by height and record the height of the middle man.
- For the middle man's height to be greater than 183 cm, at least 2 out of the 3 men surveyed must have heights greater than 183 cm.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is likely to be less than 0.5.
- Therefore, the probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm on any given day is relatively low.

For Team 2:
- On each day, they survey 1 man randomly from the population.
- The probability of the surveyed man having a height greater than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm, which is likely to be less than 0.5 but higher than the probability for Team 1.

Based on this analysis, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with a height greater than 183 cm than Team 1.
