To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved for each team's survey method.

{team: 3}

For Team 1, surveying three men each day and counting the days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm, the probability of this event is approximately 0.25. This is because the average height is 178 cm, and the heights are assumed to be symmetrically distributed around the mean. Therefore, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.25.

For Team 2, surveying one man each day and counting the days when the man's height is above 183 cm, the probability of this event is also approximately 0.25, for the same reason as above.

Since both teams are essentially counting the number of occurrences of the same event (a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm), and they are surveying from the same population, the expected number of days counted by both teams should be approximately the same, within a 5% margin of error, over the course of 365 days.

Therefore, the answer is that the two teams are likely to record about the same number of days (within 5% of each other).
