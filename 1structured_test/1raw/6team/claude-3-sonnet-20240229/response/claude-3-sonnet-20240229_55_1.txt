To answer this question, we need to consider the probability distributions of the heights of the men surveyed by each team.

{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. The probability that the middle man has a height greater than 183 cm is the probability that at least one man has a height greater than 183 cm, multiplied by the probability that at least one man has a height less than 183 cm. This is because the middle man's height must be between the highest and lowest heights of the three men.

2. Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm is likely to be less than 0.5.

3. Therefore, the probability that the middle man has a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

4. On the other hand, Team 2 surveys only one man each day. The probability that the surveyed man has a height greater than 183 cm is likely to be greater than the probability that the middle man in Team 1's survey has a height greater than 183 cm.

5. Since Team 2 has a higher probability of surveying a man with a height greater than 183 cm on any given day, it is likely that Team 2 counted more such days than Team 1 over the period of 365 days.

However, it's important to note that this conclusion assumes that the height distribution in the population is approximately symmetric around the mean of 178 cm, and that the heights of the men surveyed on different days are independent events. If these assumptions are violated, the conclusion may not hold.
