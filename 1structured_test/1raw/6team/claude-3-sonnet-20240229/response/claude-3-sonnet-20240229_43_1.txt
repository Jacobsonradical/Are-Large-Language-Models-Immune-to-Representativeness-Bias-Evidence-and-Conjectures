To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and compare the expected values for the two teams.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is above 183 cm.

Assuming a symmetric distribution of heights around the mean of 178 cm, the probability of a man's height being greater than 183 cm is 0.5 (since there are as many men above average as below average).

For Team 1:
The probability of at least one of the three men having a height greater than 183 cm is 1 - (0.5)^3 = 0.875 (since the events are independent).
Therefore, the expected number of days when the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is 0.875 × 365 = 319.375 days.

For Team 2:
The probability of a man's height being greater than 183 cm is 0.5.
Therefore, the expected number of days when the man's height is greater than 183 cm is 0.5 × 365 = 182.5 days.

Comparing the expected values, Team 1 is expected to count more days than Team 2.
