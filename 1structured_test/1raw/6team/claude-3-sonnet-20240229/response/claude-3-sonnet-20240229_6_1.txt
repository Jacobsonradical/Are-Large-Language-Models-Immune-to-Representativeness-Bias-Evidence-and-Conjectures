To answer this question, I need to understand the probability distributions involved.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as below average.
- We can assume that the heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.

For Team 1:
- They survey 3 men randomly each day and record the number of days when the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm.
- The probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is the area under the normal curve to the right of 183 cm.
- This probability is approximately 0.3085 (using a standard normal distribution table or calculator).
- The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm when 3 men are selected randomly is (0.3085)^3 = 0.0292 or about 2.92%.

For Team 2:
- They survey 1 man randomly each day and record the number of days when the man's height is greater than 183 cm.
- The probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is 0.3085.

Since Team 1 has a much lower probability (0.0292) of recording a day when the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm compared to Team 2 (0.3085), we can expect Team 2 to record more such days.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
