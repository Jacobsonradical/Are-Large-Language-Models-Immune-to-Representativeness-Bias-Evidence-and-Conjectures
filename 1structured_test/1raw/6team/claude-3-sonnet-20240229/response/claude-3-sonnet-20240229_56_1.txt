To answer this question, let's make the following assumptions:

1. The heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.
2. The standard deviation of the heights is not given, but we can assume a reasonable value, say 10 cm.

With these assumptions, we can calculate the probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm.

Using a standard normal distribution calculator or table, the z-score corresponding to a height of 183 cm is (183 - 178) / 10 = 0.5.

The probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is the area under the normal curve to the right of z = 0.5, which is approximately 0.309 or 30.9%.

Now, let's consider the two teams:

Team 1:
- On each day, they survey 3 men and rank them by height.
- The probability that the middle man has a height greater than 183 cm is the probability that at least 2 out of the 3 men have a height greater than 183 cm.
- This probability can be calculated using the binomial distribution with n = 3 and p = 0.309.
- The probability of having at least 2 successes (men with height > 183 cm) out of 3 trials is approximately 0.227 or 22.7%.

Team 2:
- On each day, they survey 1 man.
- The probability that the man has a height greater than 183 cm is simply 0.309 or 30.9%.

Comparing the two probabilities, we can see that Team 2 has a higher probability of counting more days with a man taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
