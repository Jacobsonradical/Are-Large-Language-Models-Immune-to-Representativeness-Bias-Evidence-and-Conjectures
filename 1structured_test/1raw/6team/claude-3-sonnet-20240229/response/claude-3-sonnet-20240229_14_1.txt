To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men randomly each day and rank them by height.
- They count the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man randomly each day.
- They count the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and the distribution is symmetric around the average, we can assume that the probability of a man's height being greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.5.

For Team 1:
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is more complicated to calculate, as it involves the order statistics of three randomly selected heights.
- However, we can reasonably expect this probability to be less than 0.5, as the middle man is not necessarily the tallest of the three.

For Team 2:
- The probability that the man's height is greater than 183 cm is simply 0.5.

Given that Team 2 has a higher probability of counting a day as "more than 183 cm," and they perform this check every day (just like Team 1), it is reasonable to expect that Team 2 will count more such days than Team 1.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
