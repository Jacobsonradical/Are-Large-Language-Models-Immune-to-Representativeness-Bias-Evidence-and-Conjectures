To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probability distributions of the heights recorded by each team.

Given information:
- Average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men randomly each day and rank them by height.
- They count the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man randomly each day.
- They count the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, we can assume that the heights of men in the population follow a symmetric distribution around 178 cm.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights. If we assume a normal distribution, the probability would be relatively low since 183 cm is quite far from the mean of 178 cm.

For Team 2, the probability of a man's height being greater than 183 cm is simply the proportion of men in the population whose height exceeds 183 cm. This proportion is likely to be higher than the probability for Team 1, as it does not depend on the ranking of heights.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 recorded more days with heights greater than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
