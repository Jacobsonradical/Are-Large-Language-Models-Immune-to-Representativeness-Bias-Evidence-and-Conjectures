To answer this question, we need to consider the probability distributions of the heights of the surveyed individuals for each team.

{team: 2}

For Team 1, who surveys three men each day, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is not directly given by the information provided. The average height being 178 cm and the distribution being symmetric around the average does not necessarily imply a specific probability for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm.

However, for Team 2, who surveys one man each day, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is directly related to the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm. Since the height distribution is symmetric around the average of 178 cm, and there are as many men above the average as below, the probability of randomly selecting a man taller than 183 cm is greater than 0.5.

Therefore, Team 2, who surveys one man each day, is more likely to have recorded more days with the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1, who surveys three men each day and looks at the middle man's height.
