To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and compare them.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, we can assume that the heights of men in the population follow a symmetric distribution around 178 cm.

For Team 1, when they survey three men each day and rank them by height, the probability that the middle man's height is more than 183 cm depends on the specific distribution of heights. However, we can expect this probability to be lower than the probability of a single man's height being more than 183 cm, as the middle man is not the tallest of the three.

For Team 2, they are simply counting the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm, which is directly proportional to the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm.

Based on this reasoning, Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the man's height is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1 counting the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
