{team: 2}

To explain:

1. For Team 1, each day they survey 3 random men and rank them by height. The height of the middle man is then recorded if it's above 183 cm.

Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average height as below, the probability of randomly selecting a man with height above 183 cm is less than 0.5.

When selecting 3 random men, the probability of the middle man having a height above 183 cm is even lower than 0.5.

2. For Team 2, each day they survey 1 random man, and record if his height is above 183 cm.

Since the probability of randomly selecting a man with height above 183 cm is less than 0.5 but not extremely low, Team 2 is likely to record more days with a height above 183 cm compared to Team 1.

Therefore, Team 2 is expected to have counted more such days than Team 1.
