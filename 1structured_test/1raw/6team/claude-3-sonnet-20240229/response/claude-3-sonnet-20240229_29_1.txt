To answer this question, we need to consider the probability distributions involved for each team's survey method.

{team: 2}

For Team 1, who surveys three men each day and ranks them by height, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights in the population. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below, the distribution is likely to be approximately symmetric around 178 cm. In this case, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm would be relatively low.

For Team 2, who surveys only one man each day, the probability of that man being taller than 183 cm depends solely on the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, we can expect a significant portion of the population to be taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 2, who surveys one man each day, is more likely to have recorded more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1, who recorded the middle man's height from a group of three.
