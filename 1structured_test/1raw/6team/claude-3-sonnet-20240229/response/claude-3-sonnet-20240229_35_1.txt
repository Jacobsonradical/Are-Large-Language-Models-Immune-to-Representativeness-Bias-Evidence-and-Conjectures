To solve this problem, let's make a few assumptions and simplify the calculations:

1. The heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.
2. The standard deviation of heights is not given, but we can assume a reasonable value, say 6 cm.

With these assumptions, we can calculate the probability that a randomly selected man's height is greater than 183 cm.

Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the probability of a value being greater than 0.833 standard deviations above the mean (i.e., (183 - 178) / 6 = 0.833) is approximately 0.2023 or 20.23%.

Now, let's consider the two teams:

Team 1:
On each day, they survey 3 men and record the number of days when the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm.
The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is (0.2023)^3 + 3 * (0.2023)^2 * (1 - 0.2023) = 0.0821 or 8.21%.

Team 2:
On each day, they survey 1 man and record the number of days when the man's height is greater than 183 cm.
The probability of the man being taller than 183 cm is 0.2023 or 20.23%.

Comparing the two probabilities, Team 2 has a higher probability of recording more days where the height is greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
