To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability distributions of the heights of the surveyed individuals for both teams.

For Team 1:
- Each day, they survey 3 random men from the population.
- The probability that the height of the middle man (after ranking) is greater than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights in the population.
- Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below, we can assume a symmetric distribution around 178 cm.
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is likely to be less than 0.5 but not negligible.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they survey 1 random man from the population.
- The probability that the height of the surveyed man is greater than 183 cm is the same as the probability that a randomly selected man from the population has a height greater than 183 cm.
- Since the average height is 178 cm and the distribution is symmetric around the average, this probability is likely to be less than 0.5.

Comparing the two teams:
- Team 1 has a higher chance of recording a day with the middle man's height greater than 183 cm because they survey 3 men each day.
- However, the probability for Team 1 is still less than 0.5.
- Team 2 has a lower chance of recording such a day since they survey only 1 man each day, but their probability is also less than 0.5.

Given the symmetry of the height distribution and the fact that both teams have a probability less than 0.5 for recording a day with the desired height condition, it is reasonable to assume that the total number of days recorded by both teams would be similar, within a 5% difference.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 3}
