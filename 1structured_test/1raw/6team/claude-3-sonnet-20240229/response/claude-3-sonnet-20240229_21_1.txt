To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm in each team's survey method.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 randomly surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and the heights are symmetrically distributed around the average, we can assume that the probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

For Team 1:
The probability of selecting three men with heights greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5^3 (since the events are independent).
The probability of selecting one man with a height greater than 183 cm and the other two with heights less than or equal to 183 cm is 3 × (0.5 × 0.5^2) (since there are three ways to arrange the taller man).
The probability of selecting two men with heights greater than 183 cm and one man with a height less than or equal to 183 cm is 3 × (0.5^2 × 0.5) (since there are three ways to arrange the shorter man).

Therefore, the probability of selecting a middle man with a height greater than 183 cm is less than the sum of these probabilities, which is less than 0.5.

For Team 2:
The probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

Since the probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5 for both teams, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with a man's height greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
