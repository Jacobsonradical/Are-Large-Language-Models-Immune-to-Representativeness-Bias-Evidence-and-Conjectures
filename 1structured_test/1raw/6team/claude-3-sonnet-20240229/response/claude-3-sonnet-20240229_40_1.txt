To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of selecting men taller than 183 cm for each team.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them based on their height.
- They count the number of days when the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm.
- The probability of selecting three men taller than 183 cm is (0.5)^3 = 0.125 (assuming heights are uniformly distributed).
- The probability of selecting two men taller than 183 cm and one man shorter than 183 cm is 3 × (0.5)^2 × (0.5) = 0.375.
- Therefore, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is 0.125 + 0.375 = 0.5.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- They count the number of days when the man's height is greater than 183 cm.
- The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is 0.5 (assuming heights are uniformly distributed).

Since both teams have the same probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm (0.5), we can expect them to record a similar number of days (within 5% of each other) over the period of 365 days.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 3}
