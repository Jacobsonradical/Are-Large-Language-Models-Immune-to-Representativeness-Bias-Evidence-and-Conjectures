To answer this question, let's first understand the problem:

- The average height of men in the population is 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys 3 men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys 1 man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Now, let's analyze the probabilities for each team:

1. Team 1:
   - To have the middle man's height more than 183 cm, at least 2 out of the 3 men must have a height greater than 183 cm.
   - Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5.
   - The probability of having 2 or 3 men with height greater than 183 cm out of 3 is less than 0.5.

2. Team 2:
   - The probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5.

From the analysis, it's clear that Team 2 has a higher probability of counting more days when the man's height is greater than 183 cm since they only need one man to satisfy the condition each day, whereas Team 1 needs at least 2 out of 3 men to satisfy the condition.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
