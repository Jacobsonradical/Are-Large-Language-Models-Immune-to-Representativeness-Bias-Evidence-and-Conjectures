To answer this question, we need to consider the probabilities involved in each team's survey method.

For Team 1:
- On each day, they survey three random men from the population.
- For the height of the middle man to be more than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men must have heights greater than 183 cm.
- Assuming that the heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is roughly 0.3 (based on the empirical rule for normal distributions).
- The probability of getting at least two out of three men with heights greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.3^2 + 0.3^3 = 0.18 (using the binomial probability formula).

For Team 2:
- On each day, they survey one random man from the population.
- The probability of the surveyed man having a height greater than 183 cm is approximately 0.3 (same as above).

Since the probability of Team 1 recording a day with the middle man's height greater than 183 cm is lower than the probability of Team 2 recording a day with the surveyed man's height greater than 183 cm, we can expect Team 2 to have recorded more such days.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
