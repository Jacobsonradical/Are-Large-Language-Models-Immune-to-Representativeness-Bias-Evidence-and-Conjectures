To answer this question, let's consider the probability of selecting a man whose height is more than 183 cm in each team's survey method.

For Team 1:
- Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of selecting a man with height greater than 183 cm is less than 0.5.
- When selecting three men randomly, the probability of the middle man having a height greater than 183 cm is even lower than the individual probability.

For Team 2:
- Since they are selecting one man randomly each day, the probability of selecting a man with height greater than 183 cm is the same as the individual probability, which is less than 0.5.

Comparing the two probabilities, Team 2 has a higher probability of selecting a man with height greater than 183 cm on any given day.

Therefore, over the period of 365 days, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a height greater than 183 cm.
