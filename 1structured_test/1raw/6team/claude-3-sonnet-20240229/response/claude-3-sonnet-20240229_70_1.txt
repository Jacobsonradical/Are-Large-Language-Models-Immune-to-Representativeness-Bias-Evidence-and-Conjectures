To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved for each team's survey method.

For Team 1:
- On each day, they survey 3 random men from the population.
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm depends on the probability of selecting 3 men with specific height rankings.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5.
- The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm will be lower than the probability of selecting a single man taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- On each day, they survey 1 random man from the population.
- The probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5, but higher than the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm in Team 1's case.

Given the information provided, it is reasonable to expect that Team 2 will count more days with a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
