To solve this problem, let's consider the following information:

- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.

For Team 1, since there are as many men above average height as below, the probability of selecting a middle man with a height greater than 183 cm is relatively high. This is because the middle man will be either the tallest or the second tallest of the three men surveyed.

For Team 2, since they survey only one man each day, the probability of selecting a man with a height greater than 183 cm is lower than that of Team 1, as they are sampling from the entire population.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Team 1 will count more days with a height greater than 183 cm compared to Team 2.
