To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men randomly each day and rank them based on their height.
- They count the number of days when the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man randomly each day.
- They count the number of days when the height of the man is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and the distribution is symmetric around the average, we can assume that the heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution with a mean of 178 cm.

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm depends on the distribution of the order statistics of a sample of size 3 from a normal distribution. This probability is relatively smaller compared to the probability of a single observation being taller than 183 cm.

For Team 2, the probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is simply the area under the normal curve to the right of 183 cm, which is larger than the probability for Team 1.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 recorded more days with heights taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
