To answer this question, we need to consider the probability distributions of the heights sampled by each team.

{team: 2}

For Team 1, who surveys three men each day, the height of the middle man (after ranking) follows the distribution of the median of three random samples from the population. Since the average height in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men above the average as below, the median height in the population is also 178 cm. The probability that the median of three random samples is greater than 183 cm is relatively small.

For Team 2, who surveys one man each day, the height of the surveyed man follows the distribution of a single random sample from the population. Since the population has an average height of 178 cm, and there are as many men above the average as below, the probability that a randomly sampled man has a height greater than 183 cm is higher than the probability for Team 1.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 counted more days with a height greater than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
