To solve this problem, we need to understand the probability distributions involved for each team's survey method.

For Team 1:
- They survey 3 men each day and rank them according to height.
- The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights in the population.
- Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below average, we can assume that the heights follow a symmetric distribution around the mean (e.g., a normal distribution).
- In a symmetric distribution, the probability of the middle value (in this case, the middle man's height) being above a certain value (183 cm) is less than 0.5.

For Team 2:
- They survey 1 man each day.
- The probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is the proportion of men in the population whose height is above 183 cm.
- Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below average, the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is expected to be greater than 0.5.

Based on these considerations, Team 2 is more likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
