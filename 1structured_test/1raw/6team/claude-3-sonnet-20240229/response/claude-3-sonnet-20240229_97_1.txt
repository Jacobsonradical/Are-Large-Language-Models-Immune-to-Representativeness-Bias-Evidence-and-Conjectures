To answer this question, we need to understand the probability distributions involved and compare them.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys 3 men randomly each day.
- Ranks the 3 men based on their height.
- Counts the number of days when the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 man randomly each day.
- Counts the number of days when the height of the man is more than 183 cm.

Since the population is assumed to be normally distributed around the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm (which is 5 cm above the average) is approximately 0.3085 (using the standard normal distribution table).

For Team 1:
- The probability of the middle man having a height greater than 183 cm is the probability of at least 2 out of the 3 randomly selected men having a height greater than 183 cm.
- This probability is calculated as: 3C2 × (0.3085)^2 × (1 - 0.3085) + 3C3 × (0.3085)^3 ≈ 0.2138 (using the binomial distribution formula).

For Team 2:
- The probability of the randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is simply 0.3085.

Since the probability for Team 1 (0.2138) is lower than the probability for Team 2 (0.3085), we can expect Team 2 to have counted more days with a height greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 2}
