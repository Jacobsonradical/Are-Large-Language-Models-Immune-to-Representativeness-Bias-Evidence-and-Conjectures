To solve this problem, I need to understand the probability distributions of the heights measured by each team.

For Team 1:
- They survey 3 men each day and rank them by height.
- The middle man's height is recorded if it is greater than 183 cm.
- Since the average height is 178 cm, and the heights are symmetrically distributed around the mean, the probability that a randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm is 0.5 (assuming a normal distribution).
- The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is the probability that at least 2 out of the 3 men have heights greater than 183 cm, which is (0.5)^3 + 3(0.5)^2(0.5) = 0.375.

For Team 2:
- They survey 1 man each day.
- The probability that the man's height is greater than 183 cm is 0.5.

Comparing the two probabilities, Team 1 has a lower probability (0.375) of recording a day where the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm, compared to Team 2 (0.5).

Therefore, my answer is:

{team: 2}
