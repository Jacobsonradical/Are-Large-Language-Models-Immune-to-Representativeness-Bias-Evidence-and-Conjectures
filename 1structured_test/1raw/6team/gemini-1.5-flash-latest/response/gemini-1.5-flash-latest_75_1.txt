{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  While Team 1 surveys three men, the middle man is only considered if his height is above 183cm.  This means they only count days where *at least* two out of the three men are taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183cm to count the day. 

Since there are more days where a single man might be taller than 183cm than days where at least two out of three men are taller than 183cm, Team 2 is more likely to count more days.
