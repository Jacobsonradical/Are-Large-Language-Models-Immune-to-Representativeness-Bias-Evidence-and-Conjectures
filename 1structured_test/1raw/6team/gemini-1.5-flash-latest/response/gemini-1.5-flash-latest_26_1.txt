Here's how to break down the problem to arrive at the answer:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Team 1:**  They are looking for days where the *middle* man in a group of 3 is taller than 183 cm. This means *at least two* out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2:** They are looking for days where *any* single man is taller than 183 cm.

**Reasoning:**

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, there's a higher probability that a randomly selected group of 3 will have at least one man taller than 183 cm. This is because it's easier for at least one man in a group of three to be above average than for the middle man specifically to be above average.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}

**Explanation:** Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a man taller than 183 cm because they only need one man to meet the criteria, while Team 1 needs two out of three.
