{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Strategy:** Team 1 is looking for the middle man in a group of three to be taller than 183 cm. This means that at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm.  Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers above and below average, it's statistically less likely to have two out of three men taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2's Strategy:** Team 2 only needs one man out of one to be taller than 183 cm. This has a higher probability of occurring since it only requires one person to meet the criteria.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.
