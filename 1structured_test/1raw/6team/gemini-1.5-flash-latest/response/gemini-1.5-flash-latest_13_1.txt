{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's approach:** Team 1 is focusing on the middle man out of three. This means they are more likely to get a man who is closer to the average height (178 cm). It's less likely that the middle man will be significantly taller than 183 cm. 
* **Team 2's approach:** Team 2 is looking at a single individual each day. Since the distribution of heights is balanced around the average, there's a 50% chance of selecting a man taller than average. This means they have a better chance of selecting someone taller than 183 cm.

**Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the man is taller than 183 cm.**
