Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Team 1:**  They are looking for the middle man in a group of three to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2:** They are looking for a single man to be taller than 183 cm.

**Reasoning:**

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below,  there are likely fewer men taller than 183 cm than men shorter than 183 cm.  

* **Team 1** has a lower chance of finding a middle man taller than 183 cm because it needs at least two tall men in a group of three.
* **Team 2** has a higher chance of finding a single man taller than 183 cm.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
