{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Approach:** Team 1 is looking for the middle man in a group of three to be taller than 183 cm.  This is a more stringent requirement than just looking for *any* man to be taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2's Approach:** Team 2 only needs *one* man out of the entire population to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and half the population is above average, there's a decent chance that any given man will be taller than 183 cm. 

**Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.**
