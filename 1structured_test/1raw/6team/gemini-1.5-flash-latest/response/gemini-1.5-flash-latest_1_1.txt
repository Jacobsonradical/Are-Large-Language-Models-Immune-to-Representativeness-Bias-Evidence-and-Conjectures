Here's how to think about this problem:

* **Team 1's Strategy:** Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means *at least two* of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm.  Since the average height is 178 cm, there's a good chance that at least one of the men will be shorter than average, making it less likely for the middle man to be above 183 cm.
* **Team 2's Strategy:** Team 2 only needs *one* man to be taller than 183 cm. This is a much simpler condition to meet.

**Conclusion:** Team 2 has a higher probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm on any given day. Therefore, they are more likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.

**Answer:** {team: 2}
