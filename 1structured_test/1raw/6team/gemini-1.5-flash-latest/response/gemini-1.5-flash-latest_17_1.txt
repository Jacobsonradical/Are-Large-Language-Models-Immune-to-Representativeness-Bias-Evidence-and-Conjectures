{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  They need to find a middle man taller than 183 cm. This means *at least two* out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, this is a less likely scenario.
* **Team 2:** They only need one man to be taller than 183 cm. This is a more likely outcome since half the population is above average height.

While we don't know the exact distribution of heights, the probability of finding at least two men taller than 183 cm is much lower than finding one man taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days.
