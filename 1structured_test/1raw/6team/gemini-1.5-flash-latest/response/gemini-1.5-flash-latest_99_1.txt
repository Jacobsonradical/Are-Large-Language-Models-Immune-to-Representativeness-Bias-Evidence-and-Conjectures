{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's approach:**  Team 1 has to have *all three* men in their sample be taller than 183 cm for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This makes it less likely for them to count a day where the middle man is taller than 183 cm.

* **Team 2's approach:** Team 2 only needs *one* man to be taller than 183 cm. This makes it much more likely for them to count a day where the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

**In conclusion:** Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm.
