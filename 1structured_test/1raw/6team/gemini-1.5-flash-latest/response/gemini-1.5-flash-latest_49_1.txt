{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Strategy:** Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm.  Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below average, the probability of getting two men taller than 183 cm in a group of three is relatively low.

* **Team 2's Strategy:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, a significant portion of the population is likely taller than 183 cm, making it more probable for Team 2 to encounter someone taller than 183 cm on any given day.

**Conclusion:** Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
