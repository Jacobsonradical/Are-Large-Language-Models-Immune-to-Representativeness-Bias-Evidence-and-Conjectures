{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Challenge:** Team 1 needs the middle man out of three to be over 183cm. This means at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183cm.  Since the average height is 178cm, having two men out of three exceed 183cm is less likely than having just one man exceed 183cm.
* **Team 2's Advantage:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183cm.  Since there are as many men above average height as below, this is a more likely scenario than Team 1's requirement. 

**Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days with a man taller than 183cm.**
