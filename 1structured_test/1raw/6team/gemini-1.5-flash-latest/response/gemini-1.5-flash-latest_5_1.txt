{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's approach:** Team 1 is looking for the middle man out of three to be taller than 183 cm. This means *at least two* out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm.  The probability of this happening is lower than the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm.

* **Team 2's approach:** Team 2 only needs one man out of one to be taller than 183 cm. This has a higher probability than the scenario Team 1 is looking for.

**Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.**
