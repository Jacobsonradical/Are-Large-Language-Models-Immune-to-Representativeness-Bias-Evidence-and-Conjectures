{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's strategy:**  Team 1 is looking for a specific ranking (middle man taller than 183 cm). While this can happen, it's a more specific event than simply finding one man taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2's strategy:** Team 2 is looking for a simple condition (any man taller than 183 cm).  Since there are as many men above average as below average, there's a decent chance each day that a man they survey will be taller than 183 cm.

**In simpler terms:** Team 2 has a higher probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm on any given day compared to Team 1 finding a specific ranking. This means Team 2 is likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
