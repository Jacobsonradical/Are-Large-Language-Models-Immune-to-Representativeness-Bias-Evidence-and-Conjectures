Here's how to break down the problem and determine the answer:

* **Team 1:** They are looking for the middle man out of three to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm. 
* **Team 2:** They only need one man out of one to be taller than 183 cm.

**Reasoning:**

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below average, we can assume a roughly normal distribution of heights.  This means there will be fewer men significantly taller than 183 cm than there are men slightly above average.

* **Team 1's chances are lower:**  For Team 1 to count a day, two out of three men need to be taller than 183 cm. This is less likely than just one man out of one being taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2's chances are higher:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm, which is more likely to happen with a random sample.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
