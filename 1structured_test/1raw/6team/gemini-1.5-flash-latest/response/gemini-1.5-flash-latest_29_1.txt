{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Challenge:**  Team 1 needs to have the middle man out of three be taller than 183 cm. This means *at least two* of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below average, this is less likely.

* **Team 2's Advantage:** Team 2 only needs *one* man to be taller than 183 cm. This is a much simpler condition to meet.

**Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm.**
