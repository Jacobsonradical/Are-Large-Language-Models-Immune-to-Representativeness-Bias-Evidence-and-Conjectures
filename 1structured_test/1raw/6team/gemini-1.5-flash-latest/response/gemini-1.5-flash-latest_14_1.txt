Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Surveys three men, ranks them by height, and focuses on whether the middle man is taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2:** Surveys one man and checks if that man is taller than 183 cm.

**Reasoning**

* **Team 1 has a lower chance of finding a tall man:** Since they are looking at the middle man of three, they are less likely to find a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2, who is surveying one man.
* **Team 2 has a higher chance of finding a tall man:** Because they are focusing on a single individual, there's a greater probability that the randomly selected man will be above the 183 cm threshold.

**Answer**

Based on the above reasoning, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a man taller than 183 cm.

**Answer Format:**

{team: 2}
