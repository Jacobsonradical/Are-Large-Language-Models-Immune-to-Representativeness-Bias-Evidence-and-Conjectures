{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's approach:**  Team 1 is essentially looking for the probability of the middle man out of three being taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, there's a 50/50 chance any given man is taller or shorter than 183 cm.  The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm isn't as simple to calculate directly, but it's going to be less than 50%.  
* **Team 2's approach:** Team 2 is simply looking at the probability of any single man being taller than 183 cm, which is again around 50%.

**Conclusion:** While Team 1 might have slightly more days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm, the difference is unlikely to be greater than 5%.  Therefore, the number of days recorded by both teams is likely to be very similar.
