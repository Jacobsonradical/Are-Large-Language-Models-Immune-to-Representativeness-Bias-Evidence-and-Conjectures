{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Strategy:** Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm.  While this seems like a higher bar, it's important to remember the distribution of heights.
* **Team 2's Strategy:** Team 2 is simply looking for one man to be taller than 183 cm. This seems like a lower bar, but the sample size is much smaller.

**Reasoning:**

* Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, the number of men taller than 183 cm is likely to be significantly less than half the population. 
* Team 1 has a higher chance of getting at least two men taller than 183 cm in a single day, but this is offset by the fact that they need to succeed on two out of three tries. 
* Team 2 has a lower chance of finding one man taller than 183 cm, but they only need to do it once per day. 

**Conclusion:** The chances of either team recording more days are roughly equal. The slight advantage of Team 1's higher success rate on a single day is probably canceled out by the fact that they need to succeed twice in a row.
