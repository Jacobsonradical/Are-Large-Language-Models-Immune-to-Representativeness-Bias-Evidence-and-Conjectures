{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  Team 1 has a lower chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm because they need all three men to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, the odds of finding three men in a row who are all taller than 183 cm are relatively low.
* **Team 2:** Team 2 only needs to find *one* man taller than 183 cm on any given day. This significantly increases their probability of finding such a man.

Therefore, Team 2 is much more likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
