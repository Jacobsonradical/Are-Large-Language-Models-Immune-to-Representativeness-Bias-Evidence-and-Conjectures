{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  The probability of the middle man in a group of three being taller than 183 cm is directly tied to the proportion of men in the population taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, this proportion is likely to be less than 50%.
* **Team 2:**  The probability of a single randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the proportion of men in the population taller than 183 cm. This is the same proportion as for Team 1.

**Therefore, both teams are essentially measuring the same probability, just over different sample sizes.**  While the larger sample size of Team 1 might lead to a slightly more accurate estimate, the difference is unlikely to be more than 5%.
