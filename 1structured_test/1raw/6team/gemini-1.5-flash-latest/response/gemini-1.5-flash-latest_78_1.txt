{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's approach:** Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm.  While there's a 50/50 chance of any individual man being taller than 183 cm, the probability of two out of three being taller is significantly lower.
* **Team 2's approach:** Team 2 only needs one man out of one to be taller than 183 cm.  This is a much higher probability.

**In conclusion:** Team 2 has a higher chance of counting more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
