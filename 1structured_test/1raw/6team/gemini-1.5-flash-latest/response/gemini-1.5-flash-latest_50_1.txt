Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the answer:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Team 1:** Surveys three men and focuses on the *middle* man's height.
* **Team 2:** Surveys one man and focuses on *that* man's height.

**Key Insight:**

The crucial point is that the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below average. This means that:

* There's a greater chance of getting at least one man above 183 cm when surveying three men (Team 1). 
* It's less likely to find a man taller than 183 cm in a single survey (Team 2).

**Answer:**

{team: 1}

**Explanation:**

Team 1 has a significantly higher probability of finding at least one man taller than 183 cm in a group of three.  While Team 2 might find a tall man occasionally, Team 1 is more likely to encounter such a scenario due to surveying multiple men each day.
