Here's how to break down the problem to arrive at the answer:

* **Team 1:**  They are looking for the middle man in a group of three to be taller than 183cm. This means at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2:** They are looking for a single man to be taller than 183cm.

Since there are more men below average height than above average height, it's more likely for Team 1 to have at least two men taller than 183cm in a group of three. 

**Therefore, the answer is {team: 1}**
