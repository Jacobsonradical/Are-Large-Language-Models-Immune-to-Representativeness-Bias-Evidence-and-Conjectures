Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Team 1:** They need all three men to be taller than 183 cm for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm.  This means they're looking for a more specific outcome.
* **Team 2:** They only need one man to be taller than 183 cm.  This is a broader, less specific outcome.

**Logic:** Since Team 2 has a broader outcome to count, they are more likely to encounter a day where the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

**Answer:** {team: 2}
