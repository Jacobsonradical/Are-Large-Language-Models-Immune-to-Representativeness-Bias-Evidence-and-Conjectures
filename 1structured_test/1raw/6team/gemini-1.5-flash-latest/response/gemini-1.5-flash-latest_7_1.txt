{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  While they are surveying three men, the middle man being taller than 183 cm depends on the distribution of heights within that group.  It's possible all three could be above 183 cm, or none of them, or any combination. 
* **Team 2:** They are directly measuring against the 183 cm threshold. 

The key is that the average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below average. This suggests that the number of men taller than 183 cm is likely a smaller percentage of the population.

Therefore, while Team 2 is only surveying one person per day, they are more likely to get a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1 is likely to get a middle man out of three that is taller than 183 cm.  However, the difference may be small, hence why the answer is "about the same (within 5% of each other)."
