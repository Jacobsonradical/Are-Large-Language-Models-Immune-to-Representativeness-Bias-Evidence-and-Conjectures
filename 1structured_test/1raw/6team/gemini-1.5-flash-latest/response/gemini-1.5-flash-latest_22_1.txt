Here's how to reason through this:

* **Team 1:**  They are looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above and below average, this means the middle man is likely to be close to the average height. It's much less likely he'll be significantly taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2:** They only need one man to be taller than 183 cm. Since there are men taller than 183 cm, they will have a higher chance of encountering one on any given day.

**Therefore:** Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a man taller than 183 cm.

**Answer:** {team: 2}
