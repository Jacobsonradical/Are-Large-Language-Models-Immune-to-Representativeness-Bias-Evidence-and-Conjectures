{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Challenge:** Team 1 needs to find a day where the middle man out of three is taller than 183 cm. This means *all three* men must be taller than 183 cm.  The chances of this happening are relatively low, especially since half the population is below the average height of 178 cm.
* **Team 2's Advantage:** Team 2 only needs one man out of one to be taller than 183 cm. Since there are men taller than 183 cm in the population, this will happen more frequently than Team 1's condition. 

**In summary:** Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm because they only need one person to meet that criteria, while Team 1 needs three.
