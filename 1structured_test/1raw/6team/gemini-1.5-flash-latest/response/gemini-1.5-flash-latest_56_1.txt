{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Challenge:** Team 1 needs to find a middle man taller than 183 cm. This means *all three* men they survey need to be above average height (178 cm) *and* at least one needs to be taller than 183 cm.  This is a more stringent requirement.
* **Team 2's Advantage:** Team 2 only needs to find *one* man taller than 183 cm.  Since the population has an equal number of men above and below average, they have a higher probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm on any given day.

**Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with a man taller than 183 cm.**
