{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's method:**  Team 1 has a lower chance of finding a day where the middle man is taller than 183cm.  They need at least two out of three men to be taller than 183cm for this to happen. 
* **Team 2's method:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183cm to count a successful day. 

Since Team 2 has a higher chance of finding a man taller than 183cm on any given day, they are likely to count more such days than Team 1.
