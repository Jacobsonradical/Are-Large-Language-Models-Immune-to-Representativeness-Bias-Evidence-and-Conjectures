{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  Since Team 1 is looking at the middle man in a group of three, they are less likely to get a man taller than 183 cm.  There needs to be at least two men taller than 183 cm in the group of three for the middle man to be above that height.
* **Team 2:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm on any given day.  This significantly increases their probability of getting a "tall" man compared to Team 1.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
