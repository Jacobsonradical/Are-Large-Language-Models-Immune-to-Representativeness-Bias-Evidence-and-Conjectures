Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the answer:

* **Team 1:** They need the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm. 
* **Team 2:** They only need one man to be taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, there are more men below average height than above average height.  This makes it less likely for Team 1 to find two men taller than 183 cm.

**Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.**

**{team: 2}**
