{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's strategy:**  Team 1 has a lower chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm because they are looking for the *middle* man in a group of three.  The middle man is more likely to be closer to the average height.
* **Team 2's strategy:** Team 2 has a higher chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm because they are simply looking at one man at a time. They have a 50% chance of finding someone taller than average (178 cm). While 183 cm is still above average, it's more likely for someone to be above 178 cm than to be above 183 cm.

**In summary:** Team 2 has a higher probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm each day, making it more likely they will count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
