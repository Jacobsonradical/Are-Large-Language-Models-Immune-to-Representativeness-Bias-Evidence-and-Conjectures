{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's strategy is less efficient.**  They are looking for a specific outcome (middle man taller than 183 cm) in a group of three. This means they need a combination of heights where the middle man is tall, which is less likely than just having one man be tall.
* **Team 2's strategy is direct.** They are only looking for one man to be tall, and they have a 50/50 chance of finding someone above average height (since the population is evenly distributed).

While the exact number of days each team will have a taller-than-183cm man is impossible to predict with certainty, team 2 has a higher probability of getting a "tall" man each day, leading to a larger count overall.
