{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Challenge:**  Team 1 needs to have the middle man out of three be taller than 183 cm. This means *at least two* out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men above and below average, the probability of this happening is relatively low.

* **Team 2's Advantage:** Team 2 only needs *one* man to be taller than 183 cm.  This is a much higher probability since there are men taller than 183 cm in the population.

**Conclusion:** Team 2 is likely to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.
