{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  To have the middle man be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm. This means Team 1 is looking for a more specific outcome.
* **Team 2:**  They only need one man to be taller than 183 cm. This is a less specific outcome, making it more likely to occur.

Since Team 2 has a less stringent requirement, they are likely to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.
