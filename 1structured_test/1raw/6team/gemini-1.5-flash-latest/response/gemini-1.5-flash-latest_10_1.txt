{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Approach:**  By surveying three men and focusing on the middle man, Team 1 is effectively looking for a scenario where **at least two** out of the three men are taller than 183 cm. This is because the middle man is only taller than 183 cm if at least two others are taller.
* **Team 2's Approach:** Team 2 simply needs to find one man taller than 183 cm on any given day.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below average, it's likely that there are more days where you'll find at least one man taller than 183 cm than days where you'll find at least two men taller than 183 cm. 

**Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.**
