{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  While Team 1 is looking at the middle man, this still relies on random selection.  The probability of the middle man being over 183 cm is roughly the same as the probability of any individual man being over 183 cm.
* **Team 2:** This team is directly measuring the probability of a single man being over 183 cm.

Since both teams are essentially measuring the same underlying probability, they should get similar results.  The slight difference in the survey methods is unlikely to create a significant difference (greater than 5%) in the number of days they count.
