{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Approach:**  Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm.  This means *at least* two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm.  Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men above and below average, the probability of getting two or three men taller than 183 cm in a group of three is relatively low.

* **Team 2's Approach:** Team 2 only needs *one* man to be taller than 183 cm. This has a higher probability of occurring, as it only depends on the height of a single individual.

**Conclusion:** Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with a man taller than 183 cm because their method has a higher chance of success.
