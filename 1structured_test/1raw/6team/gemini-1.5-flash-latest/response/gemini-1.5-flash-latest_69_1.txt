{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Approach:**  Team 1 has a higher chance of finding a day where the middle man is taller than 183cm.  This is because they're surveying three men. However, this approach is inherently less efficient.  If only one of the three men is taller than 183cm, they'll still only count that day once.
* **Team 2's Approach:** Team 2 has a lower chance of finding a man taller than 183cm on any given day, as they're only surveying one person. However, they're directly assessing each individual, so they're more likely to count every instance where a man over 183cm is found.

**In summary:** Even though Team 1 has a higher chance of finding a tall man in a single day, Team 2's direct approach will likely result in a higher overall count of days with a man taller than 183cm.
