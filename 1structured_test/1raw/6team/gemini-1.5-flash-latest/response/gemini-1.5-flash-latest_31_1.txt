{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Advantage:** Team 1 has a higher chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm because they are surveying three men each day.
* **Team 2's Advantage:**  However, Team 2 has a simpler requirement. They only need one man to be taller than 183 cm, while Team 1 needs the middle man (out of three) to be taller.

**The key is that the probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm is lower than finding one man out of three taller than 183 cm.**

While Team 1 has a higher chance of finding at least one man taller than 183 cm on a given day, the requirement of it being the middle man makes their overall success rate lower than Team 2's.

**Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a man taller than 183 cm.**
