{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's strategy:**  Team 1 has a lower chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm because they need *two* men to be taller than 183 cm in their sample of three. Since there are more men below average height, the probability of getting two taller than 183 cm is lower.

* **Team 2's strategy:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm. This means they have a higher probability of finding a taller man on any given day.

**Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.**
