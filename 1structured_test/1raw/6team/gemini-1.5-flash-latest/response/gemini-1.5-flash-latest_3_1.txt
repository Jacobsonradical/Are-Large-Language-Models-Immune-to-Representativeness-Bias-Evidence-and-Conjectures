{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's approach:**  Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm.  This is a less likely event than a single man being taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2's approach:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm. This is a more likely event.

Since the teams are surveying from the same population, and Team 2 has a higher chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm on any given day, they are more likely to record a higher number of such days.
