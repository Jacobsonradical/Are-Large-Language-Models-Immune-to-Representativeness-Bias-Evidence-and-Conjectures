{team: 2} 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Team 1:**  To have the middle man be taller than 183cm, at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183cm. Since 183cm is significantly taller than the average height, the probability of this happening on any given day is relatively low. 
* **Team 2:**  They only need one man to be taller than 183cm.  This is a much higher probability than Team 1 needing two out of three.

Therefore, it's much more likely that Team 2 will have more days where they find a man taller than 183cm.
