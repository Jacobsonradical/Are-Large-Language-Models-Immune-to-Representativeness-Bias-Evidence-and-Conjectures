{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Strategy:**  Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, this is a relatively unlikely event.

* **Team 2's Strategy:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm.  Since there are an equal number of men above and below the average height, there's a decent chance that any randomly selected man will be taller than 183 cm. 

**Conclusion:** Team 2 is likely to record more days with a man taller than 183 cm because their criteria is less stringent.
