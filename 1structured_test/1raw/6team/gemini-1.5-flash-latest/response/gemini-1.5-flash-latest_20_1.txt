Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Symmetry:** The fact that there are as many men above average height as below average height is crucial. It means the height distribution is symmetrical around the average.
* **Team 1:**  Team 1 is looking for the middle man in a group of three to be taller than 183 cm.  This is a stricter condition than Team 2's.
* **Team 2:** Team 2 is simply looking for any single man to be taller than 183 cm.

**Reasoning**

* **Team 1:** Since Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be above 183 cm, it's likely that at least two of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm. This makes their condition less likely to be met.
* **Team 2:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm, making this condition more likely to be met.

**Conclusion**

Team 2 is likely to count more days where the man is taller than 183 cm.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
