{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  While they survey three men, the middle man's height being over 183 cm is dependent on the heights of the other two men. It's possible to have a scenario where all three are over 183 cm, two are over and one is under, or one is over and two are under.  This makes it less predictable.
* **Team 2:** They have a simple comparison â€“ one man's height against the threshold. 

While the probability of a single man being over 183 cm might be lower than the probability of at least one out of three men being over 183 cm, the number of observations Team 1 makes per day is also lower.

**It's reasonable to assume that the difference in the number of days they count would be within a 5% range due to the factors mentioned above.**
