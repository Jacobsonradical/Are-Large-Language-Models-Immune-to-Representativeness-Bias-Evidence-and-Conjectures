{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  They need the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means *at least* two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm.  Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men above and below average, this is less likely to happen frequently.

* **Team 2:** They only need *one* man to be taller than 183 cm. This is much more likely to happen, especially since there are men taller than 183 cm in the population. 

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
