{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's strategy:**  Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be over 183 cm. This means two out of the three men surveyed need to be shorter than 183 cm.  Since the average height is 178 cm, there's a higher probability of getting at least two men shorter than 183 cm in a group of three.

* **Team 2's strategy:** Team 2 is only looking for one man to be over 183 cm. This depends entirely on the individual man they select.

**However, the difference in the probability of these events is likely to be small.**  The probability of getting one man over 183 cm is likely to be similar to the probability of getting two men shorter than 183 cm out of three. 

**In conclusion:** It's likely that the number of days each team records a man taller than 183 cm will be very close. The difference is unlikely to be greater than 5%.
