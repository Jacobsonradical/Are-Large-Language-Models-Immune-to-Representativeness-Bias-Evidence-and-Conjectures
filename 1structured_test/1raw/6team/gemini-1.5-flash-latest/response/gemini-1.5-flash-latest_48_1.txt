{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's approach:**  They are essentially looking for the probability that the middle man out of three is taller than 183 cm. This is less likely than a single man being taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2's approach:** They are directly measuring the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm. 

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below,  the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of the middle man out of three being taller than 183 cm.  Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
