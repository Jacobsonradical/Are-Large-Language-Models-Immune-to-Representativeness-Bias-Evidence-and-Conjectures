{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  Team 1 needs to find a day where the middle man out of three is taller than 183 cm. This means *at least two* out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there's an equal distribution of heights above and below average, this is a less likely scenario.
* **Team 2:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm. This is a much more probable event since there are a significant number of men taller than 183 cm (though likely fewer than those under 183 cm).

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
