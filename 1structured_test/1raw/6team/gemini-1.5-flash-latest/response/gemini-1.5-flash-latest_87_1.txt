{team: 3} 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Team 1's approach:**  Team 1 is essentially looking for the probability of getting at least one man taller than 183 cm in a group of three. Since there are as many men above average as below, this probability is relatively high. However, they need at least one man taller than 183 cm, and then they also need the middle man to be the one over 183 cm. This adds another layer of probability.

* **Team 2's approach:** Team 2 is simply looking at the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm. This is a more straightforward calculation.

**Why they are likely to be similar:** While the probability of getting at least one man over 183 cm in a group of three is higher for Team 1, the additional condition of the middle man being over 183 cm significantly reduces their chances. This is likely to balance out with the simpler probability calculation of Team 2.

**Important Note:** This analysis assumes a normal distribution of heights and does not account for potential skewness or other factors that might influence the actual distribution of heights in the population.
