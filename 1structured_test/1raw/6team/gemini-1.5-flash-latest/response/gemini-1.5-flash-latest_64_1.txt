Here's how to break down the problem to figure out the answer:

* **Team 1:**  They are looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, it's likely that only a small percentage of men are taller than 183 cm.  
* **Team 2:** They are only looking for one man to be taller than 183 cm.  This is a much easier condition to meet.

**Therefore, it's likely that Team 2 will count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.**

**Answer: {team: 2}**
