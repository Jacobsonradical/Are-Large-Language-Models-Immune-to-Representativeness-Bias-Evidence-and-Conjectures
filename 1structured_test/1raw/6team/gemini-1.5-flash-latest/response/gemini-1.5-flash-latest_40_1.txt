{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Strategy:**  Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be taller than 183cm. This means they need *at least* two out of the three men to be taller than 183cm. 
* **Team 2's Strategy:** Team 2 only needs one man out of one to be taller than 183cm.

**Probability:**  Since the average height is 178cm and there are as many men above average as below, the probability of a single man being taller than 183cm is lower than the probability of at least two out of three men being taller than 183cm. 

**Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a man taller than 183cm.**
