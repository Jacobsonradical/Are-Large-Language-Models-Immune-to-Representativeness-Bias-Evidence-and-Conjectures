{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Approach:**  Team 1 is looking for the middle man in a group of three to be taller than 183 cm. This means they need *at least two* of the three men to be taller than 183 cm. This scenario is less likely than simply having one man be taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2's Approach:** Team 2 only needs *one* man to be taller than 183 cm. Since there are as many men above average as below, there's a significant chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm in a single survey. 

Therefore, Team 2 is much more likely to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.
