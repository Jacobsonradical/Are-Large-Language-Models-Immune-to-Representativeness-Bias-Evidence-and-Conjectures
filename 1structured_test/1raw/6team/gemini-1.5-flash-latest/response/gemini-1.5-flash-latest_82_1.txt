{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  Team 1 needs to have all three men in their sample be taller than 183 cm for their count to increase. This is a relatively rare event since 183 cm is likely above the average height.
* **Team 2:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm to increase their count. This is a much more likely scenario, even if the percentage of men above 183 cm is relatively small.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
