{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  While Team 1 is looking at the middle man, their focus is on a relative ranking within a small sample (3 men). This is heavily influenced by random chance. On any given day, the middle man could be unusually tall or short, regardless of the population average.
* **Team 2:** Team 2 is directly comparing each individual man's height to a fixed threshold (183 cm).  This makes their count more directly representative of the percentage of men in the population taller than 183 cm.

**The key:** Since there are as many men above average height as below, and 183 cm is likely above the average, we expect roughly the same percentage of days where Team 1 would find a middle man taller than 183 cm, and Team 2 would find a single man taller than 183 cm.

**In conclusion:** The number of days each team records will likely be very similar, within a margin of error due to random chance in sampling.
