Here's how to reason through this problem:

* **Team 1:**  They are looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means *at least two* out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men taller than average as shorter, this event is relatively less likely. 
* **Team 2:** They only need one man to be taller than 183 cm.  This is more likely to occur since there are a significant number of men taller than average.

**Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm.**

**Answer: {team: 2}**
