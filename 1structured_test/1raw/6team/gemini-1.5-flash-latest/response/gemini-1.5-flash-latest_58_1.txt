{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Approach:**  Team 1 has to find a middle man whose height is above 183cm. This means *all three* men in the group must be above average height (since half of the men are below average height). This makes it less likely for Team 1 to find a day where this occurs.
* **Team 2's Approach:** Team 2 only needs to find one man taller than 183cm. Since there are men above average height, they have a better chance of finding a day where this occurs.

Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to count more days with a man taller than 183cm.
