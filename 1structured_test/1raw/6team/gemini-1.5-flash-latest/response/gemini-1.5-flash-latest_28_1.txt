{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  Team 1 needs all three men they survey to be taller than 183 cm for their count to increase. This is a much stricter condition. 
* **Team 2:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm. 

Since there are likely many more days where at least one man will be taller than 183 cm than days where three men are all taller than 183 cm, Team 2 will likely have a higher count.
