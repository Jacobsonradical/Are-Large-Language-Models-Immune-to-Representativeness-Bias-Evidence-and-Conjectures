{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's approach:** By surveying three men and focusing on the middle man's height, Team 1 is inherently introducing a bias.  They are more likely to encounter days where the middle man is *close* to the average height (178 cm), as it's more probable to have a mix of taller and shorter individuals in a group of three.  This means they are less likely to have the middle man be taller than 183 cm.

* **Team 2's approach:** By surveying only one man each day, Team 2 is directly measuring the probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm in the population. This approach is more straightforward and less affected by the averaging effect that Team 1 experiences.

**In summary:** Team 2 is more likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm because their method directly reflects the distribution of heights in the population.
