{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's strategy:**  Team 1 has a lower chance of finding a man taller than 183cm because they need to find *three* men in a row where the middle one is taller than 183cm.
* **Team 2's strategy:** Team 2 only needs to find *one* man taller than 183cm on a given day.

Since the number of men above and below average height is equal, Team 2 has a significantly higher chance of finding a man taller than 183cm on any given day. Over 365 days, this difference in probability will lead to Team 2 counting more days with a man taller than 183cm.
