{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Logic:** Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be taller than 183cm. This means two out of three men need to be shorter than 183cm. Since the average height is 178cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below average, it's more likely that at least one man out of three will be below 183cm.  This makes it less likely for the middle man to be above 183cm.

* **Team 2's Logic:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183cm.  Since there are as many men above as below average, there's a good chance any randomly chosen man will be taller than 183cm.

**Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to count more days with a man taller than 183cm.**
