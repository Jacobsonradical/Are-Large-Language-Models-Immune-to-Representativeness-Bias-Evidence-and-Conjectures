{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's challenge:** Team 1 needs the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means *at least two* out of the three men they survey need to be taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2's advantage:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, there's a good chance of finding at least one man taller than 183 cm in a random sample. 

While we don't know the exact distribution of heights, it's likely that finding two men taller than 183 cm in a sample of three will happen less frequently than finding one man taller than 183 cm in a sample of one.
