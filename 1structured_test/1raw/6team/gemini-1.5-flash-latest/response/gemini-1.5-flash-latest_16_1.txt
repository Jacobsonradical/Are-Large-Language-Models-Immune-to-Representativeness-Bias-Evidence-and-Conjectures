Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Team 1:**  Focuses on the middle man in a group of three. This means they're essentially looking for the probability that *at least two* out of three randomly selected men are taller than 183 cm. 
* **Team 2:**  Looks at the probability of *one* randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm.

**Key Idea**

The probability of finding someone taller than 183 cm is going to be lower than the probability of finding *at least two* people taller than 183 cm in a group of three. This is because the more people you sample, the higher the chance of finding someone with a rare characteristic (being taller than 183 cm).

**Answer**

Therefore, **Team 1** is more likely to record more days with the middle man taller than 183 cm.

**Answer format:**

{team: 1}
