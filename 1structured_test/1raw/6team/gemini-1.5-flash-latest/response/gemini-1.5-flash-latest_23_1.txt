{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's challenge:** For Team 1 to count a day, the middle man out of three needs to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there's an equal distribution above and below average, the probability of this happening is relatively low.
* **Team 2's advantage:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm for their count to increase. This has a higher probability than the scenario for Team 1.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
