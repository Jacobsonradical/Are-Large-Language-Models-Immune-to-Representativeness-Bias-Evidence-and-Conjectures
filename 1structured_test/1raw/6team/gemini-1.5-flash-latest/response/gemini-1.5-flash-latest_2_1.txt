{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Strategy:**  Team 1 has a higher chance of finding a day where the middle man is taller than 183 cm. This is because they are selecting three men, and the middle man has a higher chance of being taller than 183 cm compared to a single random selection.
* **Team 2's Strategy:** Team 2 is focusing on a single random selection.  This means they have a lower chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm on any given day. 
* **The Key Factor:**  While Team 1 has a higher chance on each individual day, Team 2 has many more opportunities (365 days vs. 365 days / 3 = 121.6 days).  
* **Overall:**  The increased number of opportunities for Team 2 to find a man taller than 183 cm outweighs the slightly higher probability of Team 1 finding a day where the middle man is taller than 183 cm. 

**In short, Team 2 will likely find more days with a man taller than 183 cm due to the sheer number of chances they have.**
