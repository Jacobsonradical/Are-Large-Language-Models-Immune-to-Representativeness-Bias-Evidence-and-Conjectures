{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's approach:**  They are looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm.  This means at least two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm.  Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, finding two men taller than 183 cm (which is quite a bit above average) is statistically less likely. 
* **Team 2's approach:** They only need one man to be taller than 183 cm.  Since there are a significant number of men above the average height of 178 cm, it's more likely that Team 2 will find at least one man taller than 183 cm on a given day.

**In conclusion:** Team 2 is more likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
