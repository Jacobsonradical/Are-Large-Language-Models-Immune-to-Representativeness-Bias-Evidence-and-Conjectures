{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  The middle man in Team 1's group of three has a higher chance of being taller than 183 cm than a randomly selected individual.  This is because for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm. 
* **Team 2:** Team 2 is simply looking at the probability of a single individual being taller than 183 cm.  

Since the probability of one individual being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of two out of three individuals being taller than 183 cm, Team 2 will likely count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
