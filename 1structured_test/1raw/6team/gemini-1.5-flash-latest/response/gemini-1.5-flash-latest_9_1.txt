{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Strategy:** Team 1 has a higher chance of finding a middle man taller than 183 cm because they are looking at three men. However, they need *all three* men to be arranged in a specific way (two shorter, one taller). 
* **Team 2's Strategy:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm. 

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men above and below average,  there's a higher probability of finding *at least one* man above 183 cm than finding *three* men arranged in a specific height order.
