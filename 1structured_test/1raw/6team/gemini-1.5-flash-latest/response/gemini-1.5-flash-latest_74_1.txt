Here's how to break down the problem and determine the answer:

**Understanding the problem:**

* **Team 1:** Surveys 3 men daily and counts days where the middle man is over 183 cm.
* **Team 2:** Surveys 1 man daily and counts days where the man is over 183 cm.
* **Key information:** The average height is 178 cm, and half the men are taller than average, half shorter.

**Reasoning:**

* **Team 1:**  The middle man in Team 1's group has a higher chance of being over 183 cm compared to a randomly selected individual. This is because to be the middle man, at least one of the other two men must be shorter.
* **Team 2:**  Since Team 2 only surveys one man, they're directly measuring the probability of a single man being over 183 cm.

**Conclusion:**

Because Team 1 has a higher likelihood of finding a man over 183 cm due to the middle man being more likely to be taller than a randomly selected individual, Team 1 would likely count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.

**Answer:**

{team: 1}
