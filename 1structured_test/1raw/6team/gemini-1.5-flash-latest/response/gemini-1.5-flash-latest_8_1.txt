Here's how to break down the problem to find the answer:

* **Team 1:**  They are looking for the middle man to be over 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2:** They are looking for a single man to be taller than 183 cm.

**Reasoning:**

Since there are as many men above the average height of 178 cm as below it, the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm (which is above average) is less than 50%. This is likely to be similar for Team 1, as they need *two* out of three men to be taller than 183 cm. 

**Conclusion:**

Team 2 has a higher probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm on a given day, as they only need one. 

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
