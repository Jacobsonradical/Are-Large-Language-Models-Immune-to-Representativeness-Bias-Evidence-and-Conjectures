{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Approach:**  By surveying three men and focusing on the middle man, Team 1 is essentially looking for days where at least two out of the three men are taller than 183 cm. This is a less likely scenario than having just one man be taller than 183 cm. 

* **Team 2's Approach:** Team 2 is only looking for a single man to be taller than 183 cm. This is a much more likely occurrence.

Since the average height is 178 cm and the height distribution is symmetrical, we can assume that the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is less than 50%. This means Team 2 is more likely to count a higher number of days with a man taller than 183 cm.
