{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Strategy:** Team 1 is looking for the middle man in a group of three to be taller than 183 cm. This means that at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm.  Since there are roughly as many men above average height as below, the probability of this happening is relatively low.
* **Team 2's Strategy:** Team 2 is simply looking for any single man to be taller than 183 cm. This is a much higher probability since it doesn't require multiple men to meet the criteria.

Therefore, Team 2 is much more likely to count more days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.
