Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the answer:

* **Team 1:**  They are looking for the middle man in a group of three to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2:** They are looking for a single man to be taller than 183 cm.

Since there are an equal number of men above and below the average height (178 cm), and 183 cm is significantly higher than average, it's much more likely that a single man (Team 2) will be taller than 183 cm than it is for two out of three men (Team 1).

**Therefore, the answer is: {team: 2}**
