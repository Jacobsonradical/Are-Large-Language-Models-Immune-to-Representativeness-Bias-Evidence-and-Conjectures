{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Strategy:** Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means that *at least two* out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm.  Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers above and below average, this is a less likely scenario.

* **Team 2's Strategy:** Team 2 only needs *one* man out of the three they survey to be taller than 183 cm. This is a much more likely scenario given the distribution of heights. 

**In summary:** Team 2 has a higher probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm on any given day, making it more likely they would record more days with this outcome.
