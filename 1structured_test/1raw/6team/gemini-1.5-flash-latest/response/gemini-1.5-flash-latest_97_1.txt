Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Team 1:** They need the middle man out of three to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm. 
* **Team 2:** They only need one man to be taller than 183 cm.

Since it's stated that the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men taller than average as shorter, we can assume:

* **More men are shorter than 183 cm than taller.**

Therefore, Team 1 will have a much harder time finding days where their middle man is taller than 183 cm.

**Answer:** {team: 2}
