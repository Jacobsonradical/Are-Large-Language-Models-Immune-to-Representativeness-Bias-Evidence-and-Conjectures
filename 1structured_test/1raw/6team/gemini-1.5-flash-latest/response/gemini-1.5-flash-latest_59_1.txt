{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  The middle man in Team 1's survey has a higher chance of being taller than 183 cm compared to a single randomly chosen man. This is because to be the middle man, at least one of the other two men surveyed needs to be shorter than him. However, the probability of this happening is still relatively low.

* **Team 2:** Team 2 directly measures the height of one man each day, so the probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm is simply the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm.

Since there are likely more men whose height is *below* 183 cm than above it (as the average height is 178 cm), Team 2 is more likely to encounter taller individuals simply due to the higher probability of finding a man above 183 cm when sampling one at random.
