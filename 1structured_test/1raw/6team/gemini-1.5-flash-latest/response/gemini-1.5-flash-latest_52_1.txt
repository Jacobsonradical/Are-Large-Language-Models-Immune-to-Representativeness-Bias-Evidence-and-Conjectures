{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Strategy:**  Team 1 is essentially looking for the probability that the middle man out of three is taller than 183 cm. This probability is likely lower than the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm. 
* **Team 2's Strategy:** Team 2 is directly measuring the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men taller than average as shorter, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm is not significantly different from the probability that the middle man out of three is taller than 183 cm.  While the difference might exist, it's unlikely to be more than 5%.
