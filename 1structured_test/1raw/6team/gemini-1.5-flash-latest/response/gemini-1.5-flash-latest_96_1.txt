{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:** They are looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means two out of three men need to be shorter than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above as below average, it's statistically less likely that two out of three men will be shorter than 183 cm.
* **Team 2:** They are looking for any single man to be taller than 183 cm. This is a more likely scenario given the distribution of heights.

**Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a man taller than 183 cm.**  However, the difference is unlikely to be significant (within 5%). The exact difference would depend on the precise distribution of heights around the average.
