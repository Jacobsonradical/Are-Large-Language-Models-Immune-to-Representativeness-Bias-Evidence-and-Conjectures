{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's approach:**  They are looking for the middle man to be taller than 183cm. This means *at least two* of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183cm. 
* **Team 2's approach:** They only need *one* man to be taller than 183cm. 

Since the average height is 178cm, and there are equal numbers of men above and below average, it's statistically more likely that a single random man will be taller than 183cm than it is for two out of three randomly selected men to be taller than 183cm.
