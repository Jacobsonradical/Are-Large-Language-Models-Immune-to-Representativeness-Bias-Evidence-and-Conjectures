{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's strategy:** By surveying three men, Team 1 increases the chances of finding a man taller than 183 cm. However, they only count the day if the *middle* man is taller than 183 cm. This adds a layer of complexity and reduces the likelihood of counting a day compared to Team 2.
* **Team 2's strategy:** Team 2 is simpler, only needing one man to be taller than 183 cm for the day to count.  This strategy has a more direct relationship to the proportion of men taller than 183 cm in the population.

**Considering the average height and distribution:**

* Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below average, it's likely that the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is relatively small.
* This means both teams will likely encounter a relatively low number of days where the height criteria are met. 

**Conclusion:**

While Team 1 has a higher *chance* of encountering a taller man in any given survey, the condition of the middle man being taller introduces a significant bias. This makes it likely that both teams will count similar numbers of days within a 5% range.
