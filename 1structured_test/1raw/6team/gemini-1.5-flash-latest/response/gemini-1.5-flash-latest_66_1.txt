{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's strategy:** Team 1 is looking for the middle man in a group of three to be over 183 cm. This means that *at least two* of the three men need to be over 183 cm for this to happen. 
* **Team 2's strategy:** Team 2 only needs *one* man to be over 183 cm in their single daily survey.

Since there are more chances for a single man to be over 183 cm than there are for two out of three men to be over 183 cm, Team 2 is more likely to have more days where they count a man over 183 cm.
