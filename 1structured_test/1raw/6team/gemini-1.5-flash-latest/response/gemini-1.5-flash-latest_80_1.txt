{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's approach:**  Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be over 183 cm. This means two out of the three men surveyed need to be below 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men above and below average, it's less likely for two out of three men to be below 183 cm.
* **Team 2's approach:** Team 2 only needs one man to be over 183 cm. This is a much higher probability than needing two out of three men to be below 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
