Here's how to break down the problem to arrive at the answer:

* **Understanding the Distribution:** Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below, we can assume a roughly normal distribution of heights. This means most men will be close to the average, and fewer will be very tall or very short.

* **Team 1:**  Team 1 needs the *middle* man to be over 183 cm.  This is a higher threshold than just needing *any* man to be over 183 cm.  Since there are fewer men significantly taller than 183 cm, this will happen less often.

* **Team 2:** Team 2 only needs *one* man to be over 183 cm.  This is a much easier condition to meet.

**Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.**

**Answer:** {team: 2}
