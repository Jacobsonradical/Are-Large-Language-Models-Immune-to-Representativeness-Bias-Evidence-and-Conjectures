{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:** To have the middle man taller than 183 cm, at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm. This means Team 1 relies on the probability of selecting two taller-than-average men in a sample of three.
* **Team 2:** Team 2 only needs to select one man taller than 183 cm. 

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above as below the average, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm (which is significantly above average) is much higher for Team 2 than for Team 1. 

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
