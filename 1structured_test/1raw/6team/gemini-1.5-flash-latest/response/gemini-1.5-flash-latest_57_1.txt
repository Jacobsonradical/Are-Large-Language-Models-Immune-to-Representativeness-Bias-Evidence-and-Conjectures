{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's strategy:** Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means they need *two* out of the three men surveyed to be taller than 183 cm. This is a less likely event compared to just one man being taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2's strategy:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm. This is a more likely event.

**Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm.**
