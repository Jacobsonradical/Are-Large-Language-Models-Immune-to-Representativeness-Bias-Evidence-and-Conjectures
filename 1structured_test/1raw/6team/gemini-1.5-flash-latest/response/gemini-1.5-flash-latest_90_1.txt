Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Team 1:**  They are looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, it's less likely for two or three men in a group of three to be significantly taller than average.
* **Team 2:** They only need one man to be taller than 183 cm. Since there are as many men above average height as below, this is more likely to happen.

**Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.**

**Answer: {team: 2}**
