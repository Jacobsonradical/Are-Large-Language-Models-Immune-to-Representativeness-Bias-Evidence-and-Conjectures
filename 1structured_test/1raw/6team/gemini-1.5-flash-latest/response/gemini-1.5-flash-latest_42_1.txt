Here's how to break down the problem to determine the answer:

* **Understanding the Data:** The average height is 178 cm, and there are an equal number of men above and below average. This implies a normal distribution of heights.  
* **Team 1:** Team 1 needs the middle man of three to be above 183 cm. Since the height distribution is normal, this means at least two out of the three men need to be above average.  
* **Team 2:** Team 2 only needs one man out of one to be above 183 cm.

**Reasoning:**

* The probability of randomly selecting a man above 183 cm (which is significantly above the average) is lower than the probability of randomly selecting at least two out of three men above average.  
* While Team 1 has three chances per day, the probability of success in each individual chance is lower than Team 2's single chance.

**Conclusion:**

Team 2 is more likely to have a higher count of days where the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm. 

**Answer:** {team: 2}
