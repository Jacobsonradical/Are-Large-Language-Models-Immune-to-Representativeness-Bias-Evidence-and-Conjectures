Here's how to reason through this:

* **Team 1:**  They are looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm.  Since 183 cm is above the average height, this means at least two out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than average.
* **Team 2:** They are looking for a single man to be taller than 183 cm. This means they only need one man to be taller than average.

**Conclusion:** Team 2 is more likely to count more days where the man is taller than 183 cm. This is because they only need one man to meet the criteria, while Team 1 needs two out of three.

**Answer:** {team: 2}
