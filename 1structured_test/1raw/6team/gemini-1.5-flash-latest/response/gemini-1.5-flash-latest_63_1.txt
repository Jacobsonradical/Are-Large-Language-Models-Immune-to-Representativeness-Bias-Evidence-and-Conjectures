{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Approach:** Team 1 has a smaller chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm because they need *all three* men to be taller than 183 cm for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm.
* **Team 2's Approach:** Team 2 only needs one man to be taller than 183 cm, giving them a higher probability of finding such a man each day.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
