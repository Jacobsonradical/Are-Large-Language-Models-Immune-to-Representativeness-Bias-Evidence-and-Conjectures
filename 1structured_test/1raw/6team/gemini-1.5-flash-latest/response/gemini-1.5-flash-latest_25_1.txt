{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's strategy:**  Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means *at least two* out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm.  Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers above and below average, this is a relatively rare occurrence.

* **Team 2's strategy:** Team 2 only needs *one* man to be taller than 183 cm.  This is much more likely to happen, as it only requires one individual to be in the taller half of the population. 

**In summary:** Team 2 has a higher probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm on any given day, making it likely they would record more such days over a year.
