{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Approach:** Team 1 is looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means *at least two* out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm.  Since the average height is 178 cm, the chances of two men randomly selected being taller than 183 cm are relatively low.

* **Team 2's Approach:** Team 2 only needs *one* man to be taller than 183 cm.  This means they have a higher probability of finding a taller man in a single survey. 

**Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.**
