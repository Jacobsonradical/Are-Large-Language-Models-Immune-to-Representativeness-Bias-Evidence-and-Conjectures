{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:** The middle man in Team 1's sample has a higher chance of being taller than 183 cm than a randomly selected individual. This is because they need two out of the three men to be shorter than 183 cm. 
* **Team 2:** Team 2 is simply looking at individual instances where a man is taller than 183 cm. Since there's an equal chance of a man being above or below the average height, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is less than the probability of the middle man in Team 1's sample being taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count fewer days with a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1.
