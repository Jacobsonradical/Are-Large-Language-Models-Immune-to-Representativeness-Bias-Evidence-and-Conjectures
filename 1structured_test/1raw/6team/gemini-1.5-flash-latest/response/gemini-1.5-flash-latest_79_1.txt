{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's approach:**  They are looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means *at least two* out of the three men surveyed need to be taller than 183 cm.  Since the average height is 178 cm, and half the men are above average, the odds of getting two men taller than 183 cm in a group of three are relatively low.

* **Team 2's approach:** They are looking for *any* man to be taller than 183 cm. This is a much less stringent requirement.  Since half the men are above average, they have a roughly 50% chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm on any given day.

**Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count significantly more days with a man taller than 183 cm.**
