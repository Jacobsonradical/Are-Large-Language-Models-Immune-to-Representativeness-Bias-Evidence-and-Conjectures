{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Approach:**  Team 1 has to have *all three* men they survey be taller than 183cm for their count to increase. This means they need a fairly high concentration of men above 183cm in their sample.
* **Team 2's Approach:** Team 2 only needs *one* man to be taller than 183cm for their count to increase. This makes it much more likely for them to record a higher number of days.

**Think of it like flipping coins:**

* Team 1 is like flipping three coins and needing all three to be heads (a rare event).
* Team 2 is like flipping one coin and needing it to be heads (a more common event). 

While we don't know the exact distribution of heights above and below 183cm, it's highly probable that Team 2 will record more days with a man taller than 183cm.
