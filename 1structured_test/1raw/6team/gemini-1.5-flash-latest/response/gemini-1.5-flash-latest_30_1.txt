{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's approach:** They are looking for the middle man in a group of three to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of three men need to be taller than 183 cm.  Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below average, the probability of two out of three men being above 183 cm is relatively low. 
* **Team 2's approach:** They only need one man to be taller than 183 cm.  This means they have a higher probability of counting a day where this occurs.

**In short, Team 2 has a higher probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm on any given day, making it likely they count more such days.**
