Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Team 1:**  They're looking for the middle man in a group of three to be taller than 183cm. This means at least two out of the three men must be taller than 183cm. 
* **Team 2:** They're looking for a single man to be taller than 183cm.

**Logic:**

* Since the average height is 178cm, there are more men below 183cm than above 183cm.
* Team 1 has a much lower chance of finding two men taller than 183cm in a group of three.
* Team 2 has a higher probability of finding at least one man taller than 183cm in a single survey.

**Answer:**

{team: 2}
