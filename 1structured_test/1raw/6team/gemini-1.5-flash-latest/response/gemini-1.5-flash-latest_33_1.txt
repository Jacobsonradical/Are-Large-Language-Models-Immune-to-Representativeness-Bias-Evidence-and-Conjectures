{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  The probability of the middle man in a group of three being taller than 183cm is lower than the probability of a single man being taller than 183cm. This is because the middle man has to be taller than at least one other man in the group.
* **Team 2:** Team 2 directly measures the probability of a single man being taller than 183cm.

Since Team 2 is directly measuring the probability of a man being taller than 183cm, they are likely to record more days with that outcome compared to Team 1.
