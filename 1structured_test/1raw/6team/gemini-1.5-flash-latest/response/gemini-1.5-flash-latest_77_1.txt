{team: 3} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1:**  They are looking for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm. This means at least two out of the three men need to be taller than 183 cm.  Since the average height is 178 cm, there are likely fewer days where two out of three randomly selected men will be significantly taller than average.
* **Team 2:** They are simply looking for one man to be taller than 183 cm. Since there are as many men above average height as below, there's a decent chance they will encounter a man taller than 183 cm on any given day.

**The key point is that Team 1 has a much stricter criteria for counting a day, while Team 2's criteria is much broader.**

It's impossible to say for sure without knowing the exact distribution of heights in the population, but it's reasonable to assume Team 2 will count more days where the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm, even if the difference is within a 5% margin.
