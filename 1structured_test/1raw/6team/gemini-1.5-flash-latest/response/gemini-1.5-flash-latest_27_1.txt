{team: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Team 1's Method:** Team 1 is focusing on the middle man in a group of three.  While this means there's a chance the middle man could be taller than 183 cm, it's less likely than if they were looking at any single man. 
* **Team 2's Method:** Team 2 is simply looking at the height of a single man each day. Since the average height is 178 cm and there's an equal number of men above and below average, they have a higher probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm.

**In essence, Team 2 has a higher probability of encountering a man taller than 183 cm each day, making it likely they'll count more such days.**
