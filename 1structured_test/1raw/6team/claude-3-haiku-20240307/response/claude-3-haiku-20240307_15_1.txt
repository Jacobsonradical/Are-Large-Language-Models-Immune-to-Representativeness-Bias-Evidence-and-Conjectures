{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys three men from the population randomly every day for 365 days.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys one man from the population randomly every day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of
selecting a man taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Additionally, the ranking of the three men surveyed by Team 1 does not affect the probability of the middle man being
taller than 183 cm. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of
the man surveyed by Team 2 being taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, the number of days recorded by both teams is expected to be about the same, within 5% of each other.
