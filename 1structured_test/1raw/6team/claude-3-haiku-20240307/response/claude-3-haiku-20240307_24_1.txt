{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Randomly surveys three men from the population each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Randomly surveys one man from the population each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of a man's height being above 183 cm is approximately the same for both teams.

Team 1 surveys three men each day, so the probability of at least one of the three men being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of the single man surveyed by Team 2 being taller than 183 cm.

However, Team 1 only counts the days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm, while Team 2 counts all the days when the surveyed man's height is above 183 cm.

Considering these factors, the number of days recorded by the two teams is likely to be within 5% of each other, so the answer is 3.
