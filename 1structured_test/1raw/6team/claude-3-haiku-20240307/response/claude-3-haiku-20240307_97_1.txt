{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys 3 men per day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 surveys 1 man per day.
- Both teams are counting the number of days where the surveyed height is taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of a man's height being above 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Team 1 is surveying 3 men per day, and the middle man's height is more than 183 cm on the same number of days as the single man surveyed by Team 2.

Therefore, the two teams are likely to record about the same number of days (within 5% of each other) where the surveyed height is taller than 183 cm.
