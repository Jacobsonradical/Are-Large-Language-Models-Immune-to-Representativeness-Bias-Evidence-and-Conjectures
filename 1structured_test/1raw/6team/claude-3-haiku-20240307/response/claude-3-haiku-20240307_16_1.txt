{team: 3}

Explanation:

The key observations are:
1. The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
2. There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

This means that the distribution of men's heights is symmetrical around the average of 178 cm.

For Team 1:
- They survey 3 men per day and rank them by height.
- The middle man's height being more than 183 cm implies that the man's height is in the top 50% of the population.
- Since the height distribution is symmetrical, the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm is 0.5.
- Over 365 days, the expected number of days the middle man's height exceeds 183 cm is 0.5 × 365 = 182.5 days.

For Team 2:
- They survey 1 man per day and count the number of days the man's height exceeds 183 cm.
- The probability of a randomly selected man's height exceeding 183 cm is also 0.5.
- Over 365 days, the expected number of days the man's height exceeds 183 cm is 0.5 × 365 = 182.5 days.

Since the expected number of days for both teams is the same (182.5 days), they are about the same (within 5% of each other).
