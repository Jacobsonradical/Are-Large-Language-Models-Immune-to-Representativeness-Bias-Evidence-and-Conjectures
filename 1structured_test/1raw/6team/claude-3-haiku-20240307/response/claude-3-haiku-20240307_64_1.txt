{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys 3 men randomly each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 man randomly each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population is distributed such that there are as many men above the average height as below, the probability
of selecting a man taller than 183 cm (which is about 5 cm above the average height) is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days on which Team 1 and Team 2 record a man taller than 183 cm should be about the same
(within 5% of each other), as they are both randomly selecting from the same population.
