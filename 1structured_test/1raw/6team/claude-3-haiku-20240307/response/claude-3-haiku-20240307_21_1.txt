{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They randomly survey three men from the population each day for 365 days.
- They rank the three men with respect to their height.
- They count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They randomly survey one man from the population each day for 365 days.
- They count the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is around 178 cm and there are as many men above average as there are below average, the
probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, it is likely that the two teams will record about the same number of days (within 5% of each other) where
the height of the surveyed men was taller than 183 cm.
