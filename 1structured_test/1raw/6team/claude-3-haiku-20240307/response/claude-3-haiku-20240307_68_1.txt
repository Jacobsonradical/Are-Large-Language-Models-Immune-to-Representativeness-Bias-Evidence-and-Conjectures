{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

This means that the distribution of men's heights is symmetric around the average of 178 cm.

Team 1 surveys 3 men per day and ranks them by height. The middle man's height is more than 183 cm on a certain day if the heights of the 3 men are distributed such that the middle one is above 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys 1 man per day and counts the days when the height is above 183 cm.

Since the height distribution is symmetric, the probability of a randomly chosen man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams. Therefore, the number of days with a height above 183 cm should be about the same for both teams (within 5% of each other).
