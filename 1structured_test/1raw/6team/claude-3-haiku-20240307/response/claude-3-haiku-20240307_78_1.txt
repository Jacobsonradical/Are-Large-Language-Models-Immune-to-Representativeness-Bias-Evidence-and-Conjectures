{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys 3 men randomly each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the 3 men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 man randomly each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a random
man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Furthermore, the number of days on which the middle man's height is more than 183 cm (for Team 1) should be approximately
the same as the number of days on which the single man's height is more than 183 cm (for Team 2), as the middle man's
height is likely to be close to the average height.

Therefore, the two teams are expected to count about the same number of days (within 5% of each other), and the answer
is 3.
