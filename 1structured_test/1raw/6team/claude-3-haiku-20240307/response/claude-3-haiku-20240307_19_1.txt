{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 randomly surveys three men from the population and ranks them with respect to their height.
- At the end of the period (365 days), the team counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 randomly surveys only one man from the population.
- At the end of the period (365 days), the team counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days recorded by both teams is expected to be about the same (within 5% of each other).
