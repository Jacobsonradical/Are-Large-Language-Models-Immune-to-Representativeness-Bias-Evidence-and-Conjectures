{team: 3}

Here's my reasoning:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They randomly survey 3 men each day.
- They rank the 3 men with respect to their height, and count the number of days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They randomly survey 1 man each day.
- They count the number of days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

The key difference is that Team 1 surveys 3 men each day, while Team 2 surveys only 1 man each day. However, Team 1 is only counting the days where the middle man's height is above 183 cm, which effectively reduces their sample size compared to Team 2.

Assuming the population distribution is normal, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is about 15.9%. Given the large sample size (365 days), I expect the number of days recorded by both teams to be within 5% of each other.

Therefore, I think the number of days recorded by both teams will be about the same (within 5% of each other).
