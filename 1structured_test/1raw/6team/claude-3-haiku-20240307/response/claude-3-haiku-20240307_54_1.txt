{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Randomly surveys three men from the population each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Randomly surveys one man from the population each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

To determine which team counted more such days or if they are about the same (within 5% of each other), we need to consider the following:

1. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below average, the median height is also around 178 cm.
2. The middle man in Team 1's survey is likely to be close to the median height, and the probability of his height being above 183 cm is around 50%.
3. The man surveyed by Team 2 is randomly selected, and the probability of his height being above 183 cm is also around 50%.

Given this, the total number of days with a height above 183 cm is likely to be similar for both teams, and they are about the same (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 3}
