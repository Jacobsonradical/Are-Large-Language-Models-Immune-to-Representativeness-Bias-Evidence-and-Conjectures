{team: 1}

Explanation:

In this problem, we need to determine which team is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed individual(s) had a height greater than 183 cm.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys 3 men each day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 surveys only 1 man each day.

The key difference between the two teams is the way they select and rank the individuals.

Team 1 surveys 3 men each day and ranks them by height. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above the average as below, the middle man in the ranking is more likely to be around the average height of 178 cm.

On the other hand, Team 2 surveys only 1 man each day. Since the men's heights are evenly distributed above and below the average, the probability of the surveyed individual being taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of the middle man in Team 1's survey being taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, Team 1 is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed individual(s) had a height greater than 183 cm.
