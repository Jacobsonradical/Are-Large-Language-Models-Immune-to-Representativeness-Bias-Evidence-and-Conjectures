{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 randomly surveys three men and ranks them by height.
- At the end of the period (365 days), the team counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 randomly surveys one man.
- At the end of the period (365 days), the team counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the expected number of days with a man taller than 183 cm should be about the same for both teams, and they are likely to be within 5% of each other.

Hence, the answer is {team: 3}.
