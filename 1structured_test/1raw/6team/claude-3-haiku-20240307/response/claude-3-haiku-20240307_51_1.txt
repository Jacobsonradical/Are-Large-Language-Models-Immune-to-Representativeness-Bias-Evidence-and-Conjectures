{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men from the population each day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 randomly surveys one man from the population each day.
- Both teams count the number of days where the surveyed height is taller than 183 cm.

Since the height distribution is symmetric around the average of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Team 1 surveys three men each day, and the height of the middle man (the second tallest) is what they count. The probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man's height being greater than 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys one man each day, and they count the number of days where the surveyed height is greater than 183 cm. The probability of this happening is also the same as the probability of a randomly selected man's height being greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, the number of days counted by both teams is expected to be about the same (within 5% of each other), as they are both based on the same underlying probability.
