{team: 3}

Explanation:

The given information suggests that the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- Each day, they survey 3 random men and rank them by height.
- They are interested in the days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and the heights are symmetrically distributed, the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm is the same for each day.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they survey 1 random man.
- They are interested in the days where the height of the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and the heights are symmetrically distributed, the probability of the surveyed man's height being more than 183 cm is the same for each day.

Therefore, the two teams are expected to count about the same number of days (within 5% of each other) where the height condition is met.
