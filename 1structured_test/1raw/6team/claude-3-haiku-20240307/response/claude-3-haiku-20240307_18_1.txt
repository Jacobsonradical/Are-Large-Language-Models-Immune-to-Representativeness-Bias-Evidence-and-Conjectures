{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given the following information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys 3 men per day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 surveys 1 man per day.
- Both teams are counting the number of days where the surveyed height is greater than 183 cm.

To determine which team is likely to record more days with a height greater than 183 cm, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below, the distribution of heights is likely to be symmetric around the mean. This means that the number of men with a height above 183 cm is approximately equal to the number of men with a height below 173 cm (since 183 cm is about 5 cm above the average).

For Team 1, which surveys 3 men per day, the middle man's height is more likely to be closer to the average of 178 cm. Therefore, the number of days where the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is expected to be similar for both teams.

Assuming the distribution of heights is approximately normal, the difference in the number of days recorded by the two teams is expected to be within 5% of each other.

Therefore, the most likely answer is that they are about the same (within 5% of each other).
