{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men from the population each day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 randomly surveys one man from the population each day.
- Both teams count the number of days where the height of the surveyed man(s) is taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and the number of men above and below the average is equal, the probability of a random man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Team 1 surveys three men each day, and the middle man's height is more than 183 cm if at least one of the three men is taller than 183 cm. This means that the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of a single randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm (as in the case of Team 2).

However, the difference in the number of days counted by the two teams is not expected to be significant, as it is within 5% of each other.

Therefore, the correct answer is 3, meaning they are about the same (within 5% of each other).
