{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given the following information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 randomly surveys one man each day.
- Both teams are counting the number of days where the height of the surveyed man(s) is taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Team 1 is surveying three men each day, and the middle man's height is the one that matters. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability for a randomly selected man, which is about the same as for Team 2.

Therefore, the number of days counted by both teams is expected to be about the same, within 5% of each other.
