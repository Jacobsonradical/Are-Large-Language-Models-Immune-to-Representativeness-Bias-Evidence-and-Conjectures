{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They randomly survey three men each day and rank them by height.
- They count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They randomly survey one man each day.
- They count the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of a
randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days where the surveyed men are taller than 183 cm should be about the same for both teams,
and they are within 5% of each other.
