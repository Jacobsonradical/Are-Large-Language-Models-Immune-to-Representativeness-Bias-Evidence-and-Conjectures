{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given the following information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They randomly survey 3 men from the population each day for 365 days.
- They rank the 3 men with respect to their height.
- At the end of the period, they count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They randomly survey 1 man from the population each day for 365 days.
- At the end of the period, they count the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days on which Team 1 and Team 2 recorded a height greater than 183 cm should be about the same (within 5% of each other).
