To solve this problem, we need to analyze the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm for Team 1 and the probability of the surveyed man's height being more than 183 cm for Team 2.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Assumptions:
- The heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution.
- The standard deviation of the heights is such that approximately 16% of the men have a height greater than 183 cm.

Probability analysis:

Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 surveys three men and ranks them by height.
- The middle man's height is more than 183 cm if at least one of the three men has a height greater than 183 cm.
- The probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm is approximately 1 - (1 - 0.16)^3 = 0.4032 or 40.32%.

Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 surveys one man.
- The probability of the surveyed man's height being more than 183 cm is approximately 0.16 or 16%.

Comparison:
- Team 1 has a higher probability (40.32%) of recording a day where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm compared to Team 2 (16%).
- Therefore, Team 1 is expected to record more such days than Team 2.
