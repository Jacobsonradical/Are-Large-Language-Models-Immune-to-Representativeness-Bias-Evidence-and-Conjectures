{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men from the population each day for 365 days.
- They rank the three men with respect to their height and count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Team 2 randomly surveys only one man from the population each day for 365 days.
- They count the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm (which is above the average height of 178 cm) is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days on which the height of the surveyed men was taller than 183 cm should be about the same for both teams, and they are likely to be within 5% of each other.
