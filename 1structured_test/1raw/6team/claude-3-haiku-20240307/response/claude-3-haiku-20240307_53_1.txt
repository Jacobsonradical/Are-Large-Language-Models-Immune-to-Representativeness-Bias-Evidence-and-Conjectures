{team: 3}

Here's my reasoning:

1. The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
2. There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
3. Team 1 surveys 3 men each day and ranks them by height. The middle man's height is more than 183 cm on some days.
4. Team 2 surveys 1 man each day, and the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm on some days.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, the probability of a man's height being greater than 183 cm is approximately the same for both teams.

Therefore, I believe the number of days on which each team recorded a height greater than 183 cm will be about the same (within 5% of each other), so the correct answer is 3.
