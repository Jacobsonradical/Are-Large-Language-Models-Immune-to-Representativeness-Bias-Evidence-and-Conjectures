{team: 3}

Explanation:

The key points here are:
1. The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
2. There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
3. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
4. Team 2 surveys one man each day.
5. Both teams are counting the number of days where the man/middle man surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Given the distribution of heights, the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams. 

Team 1 is looking at the middle man's height, which is more likely to be closer to the average of 178 cm. Team 2 is looking at the height of a single randomly selected man.

Since the probabilities are the same for both teams, the number of days they record the man/middle man being taller than 183 cm should be about the same, within 5% of each other.

Therefore, the answer is 3, indicating that the two teams are about the same (within 5% of each other).
