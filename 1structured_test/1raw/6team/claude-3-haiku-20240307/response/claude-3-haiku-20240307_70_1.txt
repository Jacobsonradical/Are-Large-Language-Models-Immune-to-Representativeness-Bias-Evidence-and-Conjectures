{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys three men per day for 365 days.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys one man per day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below, the probability of a randomly
selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days on which the height of the middle man (Team 1) is more than 183 cm and the number of days
on which the height of the man surveyed (Team 2) is more than 183 cm should be about the same (within 5% of each other).

Hence, the answer is {team: 3}.
