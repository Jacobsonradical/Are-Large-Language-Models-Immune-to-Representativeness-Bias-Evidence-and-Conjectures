{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day.
- Both teams count the number of days where the surveyed height was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above and below the average, the median height is also around 178 cm.

For Team 1:
- On any given day, the middle man's height has a 50% chance of being above 183 cm.
- Over the 365 days, the expected number of days where the middle man's height is above 183 cm is 0.5 * 365 = 182.5 days.

For Team 2:
- On any given day, the surveyed man's height has a 50% chance of being above 183 cm.
- Over the 365 days, the expected number of days where the surveyed man's height is above 183 cm is also 0.5 * 365 = 182.5 days.

Since the expected number of days for both teams is the same (182.5 days), they are about the same (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, the answer is {team: 3}.
