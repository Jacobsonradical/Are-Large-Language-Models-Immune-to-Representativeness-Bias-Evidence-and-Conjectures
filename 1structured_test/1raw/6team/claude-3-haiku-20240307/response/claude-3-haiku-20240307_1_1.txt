{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys 3 men per day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 surveys 1 man per day.
- Both teams are counting the number of days when the height of the surveyed man(s) is taller than 183 cm.

To compare the teams' results, we need to consider the probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm in each scenario.

For Team 1:
- Since there are as many men above and below the average height, the middle man in the group of 3 has a 50% chance of being taller than 183 cm.
- The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm on a given day is 0.5.
- Over 365 days, the expected number of days with the middle man taller than 183 cm is 182.5 (0.5 × 365).

For Team 2:
- The probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is also 0.5.
- Over 365 days, the expected number of days with the surveyed man taller than 183 cm is 182.5 (0.5 × 365).

Since the expected number of days for both teams is the same (182.5), they are about the same (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, the answer is {team: 3}.
