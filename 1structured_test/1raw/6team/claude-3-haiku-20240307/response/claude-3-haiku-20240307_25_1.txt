{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given the information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Randomly surveys three men from the population each day.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Randomly surveys one man from the population each day.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the distribution of heights is symmetric around the average of 178 cm, the probability of a man's height being above 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Team 1 will have a higher chance of encountering a man taller than 183 cm, as they survey three men each day, compared to Team 2, which surveys only one man each day.

However, the difference in the number of days where the surveyed men were taller than 183 cm is not expected to be significant, as it is within 5% of each other.

Therefore, the teams are expected to have about the same number of days where the surveyed men were taller than 183 cm.
