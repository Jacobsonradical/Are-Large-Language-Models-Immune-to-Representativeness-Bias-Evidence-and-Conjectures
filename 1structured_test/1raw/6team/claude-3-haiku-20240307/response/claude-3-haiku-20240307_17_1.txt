{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given the following information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

This means that the distribution of heights is symmetric around the average of 178 cm. Therefore, the probability of a randomly selected man's height being above 183 cm is the same for both teams.

For Team 1, they survey 3 men each day and choose the middle one. Since the heights are symmetrically distributed, the probability of the middle man's height being above 183 cm is the same for each day.

For Team 2, they survey one man each day, and the probability of that man's height being above 183 cm is the same as the probability for the middle man in Team 1.

Therefore, the number of days on which the height of the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm should be about the same for both teams (within 5% of each other).
