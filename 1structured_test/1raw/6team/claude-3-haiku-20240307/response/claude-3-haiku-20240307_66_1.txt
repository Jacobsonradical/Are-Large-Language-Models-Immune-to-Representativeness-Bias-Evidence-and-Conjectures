{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys three men randomly each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys one man randomly each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a
randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Assuming the sampling is truly random, the number of days on which a man taller than 183 cm is surveyed should be
about the same for both teams, within 5% of each other.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
{team: 3}
