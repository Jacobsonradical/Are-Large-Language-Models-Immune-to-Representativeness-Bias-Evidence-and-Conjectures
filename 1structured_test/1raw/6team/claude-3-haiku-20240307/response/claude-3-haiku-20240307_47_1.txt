{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys 3 men randomly each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the 3 men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 man randomly each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a man's
height being above 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Team 1 is considering the middle man in a group of 3, while Team 2 is considering a single man. The expected number of
days with a man taller than 183 cm should be similar for both teams, as they are drawing from the same population.

Therefore, the number of days recorded by the two teams is expected to be about the same (within 5% of each other).
