{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys three men randomly each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys one man randomly each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population is divided equally between men above and below the average height, the distribution of heights is
likely to be symmetric around the average. This means that the chance of a randomly selected man being taller than 183
cm is the same for both teams.

Assuming the surveys are conducted randomly, the total number of days on which the height of the surveyed men exceeds
183 cm should be about the same for both teams, as the underlying distribution of heights is the same.

Therefore, I believe the number of days counted by both teams will be about the same (within 5% of each other), so the
answer is 3.
