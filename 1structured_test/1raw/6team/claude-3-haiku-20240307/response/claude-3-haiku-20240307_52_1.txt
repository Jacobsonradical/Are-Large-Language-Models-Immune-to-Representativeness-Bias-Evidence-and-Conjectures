{team: 3}

Explanation:

The key information given in the problem is:
1. The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
2. There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
3. Team 1 randomly surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
4. Team 2 randomly surveys one man each day.
5. Both teams are counting the number of days where the height of the surveyed man(s) is taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the number of days where the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm. Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days where the man's height is greater than 183 cm.

Since the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is the same for both teams, the expected number of days where the surveyed man(s) have a height greater than 183 cm should be about the same for both teams. Therefore, they are likely to be within 5% of each other.
