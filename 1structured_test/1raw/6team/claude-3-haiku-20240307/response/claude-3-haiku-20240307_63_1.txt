{team: 3}

Explanation:

Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the distribution of heights is likely to be symmetrical around the mean of 178 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. The middle man's height is more than 183 cm on a certain day if the heights of the three men surveyed are such that the middle one is taller than 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days where the height of the man surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Given the symmetrical distribution of heights around the mean of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams. Therefore, the number of days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm (for Team 1) and the number of days where the man's height is more than 183 cm (for Team 2) are likely to be about the same, within 5% of each other.

Hence, the answer is that the teams are about the same (within 5% of each other).
