{team: 3}

Explanation:

1. The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

2. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. At the end of the 365-day period, they count the number of days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

3. Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the number of days where the man's height is taller than 183 cm.

Since the height distribution is symmetric around the average of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man's height being above 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Assuming the samples are random, the expected number of days where the middle man's height is above 183 cm for Team 1 should be roughly the same as the number of days where the single surveyed man's height is above 183 cm for Team 2.

Therefore, the two teams are expected to record about the same number of such days, and the difference should be within 5% of each other.
