To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the sampling methods used by the two teams.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day.
- The height threshold is 183 cm.

Analysis:
1. For Team 1, the middle man's height has a higher chance of being above 183 cm, as the middle man is more likely to be close to the average height.
2. For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is simply the proportion of men in the population whose height is above 183 cm.

Since the population is symmetrically distributed around the average height of 178 cm, the proportion of men taller than 183 cm is likely to be smaller than the proportion of days when the middle man's height in Team 1's survey is above 183 cm.

Therefore, the answer is:

{team: 1}
