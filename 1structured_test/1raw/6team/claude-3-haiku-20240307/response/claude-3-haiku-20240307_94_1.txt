{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys 3 men randomly each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the 3 men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 man randomly each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height, the probability of getting a man
taller than 183 cm (5 cm above the average) is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the expected number of days on which Team 1 and Team 2 will record a height above 183 cm should be about the same.

As the difference is within 5%, the teams are expected to record about the same number of days.
