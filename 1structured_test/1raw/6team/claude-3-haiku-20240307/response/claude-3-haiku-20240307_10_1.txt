{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men from the population each day for 365 days.
- They rank the three men with respect to their height.
- At the end of the period, they count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Team 2 randomly surveys one man from the population each day for 365 days.
- At the end of the period, they count the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days on which the height of the middle man (for Team 1) and the height of the randomly selected man (for Team 2) are taller than 183 cm should be about the same (within 5% of each other).
