To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expected number of days when the height of the middle man (in Team 1) or the surveyed man (in Team 2) is taller than 183 cm.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 randomly surveys three men from the population and ranks them by height.
- The team counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 randomly surveys one man from the population.
- The team counts the total number of days on which the height of the surveyed man is more than 183 cm.

Analysis:
1. For Team 1:
   - Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the height of the middle man is likely to be close to the average height of 178 cm.
   - The probability that the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm is relatively low, as 183 cm is greater than the average height.

2. For Team 2:
   - Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is higher than for Team 1.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 will count more days on which the surveyed man's height is taller than 183 cm.
