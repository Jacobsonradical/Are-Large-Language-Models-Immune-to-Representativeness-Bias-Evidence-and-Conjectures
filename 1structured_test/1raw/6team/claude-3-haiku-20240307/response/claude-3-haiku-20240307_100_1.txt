Here is my analysis:

The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average. This means that the distribution of heights is symmetric around 178 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. The middle man's height is more than 183 cm on a given day if the three men's heights are distributed such that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm.

Since the heights are symmetrically distributed around 178 cm, the probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm is the same as the probability of it being less than 173 cm (since 183 cm is the same distance from 178 cm as 173 cm is).

Team 2 simply counts the number of days where the single surveyed man's height is greater than 183 cm. Since the heights are symmetrically distributed, the probability of a randomly selected man's height being greater than 183 cm is the same as the probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm in Team 1's case.

Therefore, the two teams are expected to count about the same number of days (within 5% of each other) where the height exceeds 183 cm.
