To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expected number of days when the height of the middle man (in Team 1) and the height of the surveyed man (in Team 2) are taller than 183 cm.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 randomly surveys three men from the population and ranks them by their height.
- At the end of the period, they count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 randomly surveys one man from the population.
- At the end of the period, they count the total number of days on which the height of the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm.

Analysis:
- Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the median height is equal to the average height of 178 cm.
- For the middle man in Team 1's survey to have a height greater than 183 cm, the heights of the three men must be such that the middle man's height is above 183 cm.
- This means that the probability of the middle man's height being greater than 183 cm is lower than the probability of the surveyed man's height being greater than 183 cm in Team 2's survey.

Therefore, we can conclude that:
{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the height of the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
