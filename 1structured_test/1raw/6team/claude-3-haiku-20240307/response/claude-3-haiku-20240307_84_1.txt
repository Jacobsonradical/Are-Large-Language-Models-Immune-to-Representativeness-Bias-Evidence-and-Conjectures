{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys 3 men randomly each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 man randomly each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the likelihood of the
middle man in Team 1's survey having a height of more than 183 cm is the same as the likelihood of the single man
in Team 2's survey having a height of more than 183 cm.

Therefore, the two teams are likely to record a similar number of days (within 5% of each other) where the surveyed
height was more than 183 cm.
