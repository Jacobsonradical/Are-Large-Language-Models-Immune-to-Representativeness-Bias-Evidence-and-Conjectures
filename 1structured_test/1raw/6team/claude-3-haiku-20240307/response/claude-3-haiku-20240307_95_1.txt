{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys 3 men randomly each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the 3 men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 man randomly each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of a
man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

When Team 1 surveys 3 men, the height of the middle man will be above 183 cm on the same number of days as when
Team 2 surveys 1 man and finds him to be taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, the number of days counted by both teams is expected to be about the same (within 5% of each other).
