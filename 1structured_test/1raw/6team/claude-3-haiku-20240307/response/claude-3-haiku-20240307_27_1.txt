{team: 3}

Explanation:

The key points here are:
1. The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
2. Team 1 surveys three men per day and ranks them by height, then counts the number of days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
3. Team 2 surveys one man per day and counts the number of days where the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Given the symmetry in the height distribution, the probability of a man's height being above 183 cm is the same for both teams. Since Team 1 is looking at the middle man's height, and Team 2 is looking at the height of a single random man, the total number of days where the conditions are met should be about the same for both teams, within 5% of each other.

Therefore, the correct answer is {team: 3}.
