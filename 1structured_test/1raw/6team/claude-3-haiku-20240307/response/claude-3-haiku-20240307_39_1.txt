{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men randomly each day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 surveys one man randomly each day.
- Both teams count the number of days where the height of the surveyed man(s) is taller than 183 cm.

To determine which team counted more such days, we need to consider the following:

1. Team 1:
   - Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above and below the average, the middle-ranked man
     on any given day is likely to be close to the average height of 178 cm.
   - The probability of the middle-ranked man being taller than 183 cm is relatively low, as this would require him to
     be in the upper end of the height distribution.
   - Over the course of 365 days, the total number of days where the middle-ranked man is taller than 183 cm is likely
     to be low.

2. Team 2:
   - Since Team 2 surveys only one man per day, the probability of that man being taller than 183 cm is the same as
     the probability of a randomly selected man from the population being taller than 183 cm.
   - This probability is likely to be similar to the probability of the middle-ranked man in Team 1's survey being
     taller than 183 cm.

Given the similarities in the underlying probabilities for both teams, it is reasonable to conclude that the number of
days where the surveyed man(s) are taller than 183 cm will be about the same for both teams (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, the answer is {team: 3}.
