{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men from the population each day and ranks them with respect to their height.
- At the end of the period (365 days), the team counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Team 2 randomly surveys only one man from the population each day.
- At the end of the period (365 days), the team counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as there are below average, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the two teams are likely to count about the same number of days (within 5% of each other) where the surveyed man's height was more than 183 cm.
