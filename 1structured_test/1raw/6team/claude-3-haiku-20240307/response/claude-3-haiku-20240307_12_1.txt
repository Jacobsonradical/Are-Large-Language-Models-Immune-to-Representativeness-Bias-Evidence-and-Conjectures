{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 randomly surveys three men from the population and ranks them by height.
- At the end of the 365-day period, the team counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 randomly surveys only one man from the population.
- At the end of the 365-day period, the team counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is around 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the total number of days on which the height of the middle man (Team 1) or the randomly selected man (Team 2) is more than 183 cm should be about the same, within 5% of each other.
