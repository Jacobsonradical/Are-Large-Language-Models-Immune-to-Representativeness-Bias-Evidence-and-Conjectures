{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys 3 men randomly each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the 3 men by their height and counts the number of days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 man randomly each day for 365 days.
- Counts the number of days where the height of the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has as many men above average height as below average height, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days recorded by both teams is likely to be about the same, within 5% of each other.
