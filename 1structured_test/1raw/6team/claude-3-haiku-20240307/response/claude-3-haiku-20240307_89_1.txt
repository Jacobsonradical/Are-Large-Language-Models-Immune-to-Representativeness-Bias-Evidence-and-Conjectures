{team: 3}

Explanation:

Based on the given information, the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1, they randomly survey three men each day and rank them with respect to their height. The question is asking about the total number of days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Given that the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above and below the average, the distribution of heights is likely to be symmetric. This means that the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm is the same for each day.

For Team 2, they randomly survey one man each day and count the total number of days where the height of the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Since the distribution of heights is likely to be symmetric, the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of the middle man in Team 1's survey being taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, the two teams are expected to have a similar number of days where the surveyed height is more than 183 cm, and they are likely to be within 5% of each other.
