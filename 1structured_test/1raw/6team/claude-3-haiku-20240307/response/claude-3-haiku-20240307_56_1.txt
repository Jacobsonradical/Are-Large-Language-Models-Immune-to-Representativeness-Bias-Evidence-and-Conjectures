{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Randomly surveys three men from the population each day.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Randomly surveys one man from the population each day.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population is symmetrically distributed around the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly
selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Team 1 is looking at the middle man, while Team 2 is looking at any randomly selected man. However, the probability
of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than
183 cm.

Therefore, the number of days counted by both teams is expected to be about the same (within 5% of each other).
