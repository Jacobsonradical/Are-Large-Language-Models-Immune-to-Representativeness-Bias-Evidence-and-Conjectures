{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey 3 men randomly each day.
- They rank the 3 men with respect to their height.
- They count the total number of days when the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They survey 1 man randomly each day.
- They count the total number of days when the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above as below the average, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams. Therefore, the number of days recorded by both teams is expected to be about the same (within 5% of each other).
