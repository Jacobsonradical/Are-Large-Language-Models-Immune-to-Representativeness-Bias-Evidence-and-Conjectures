{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- Each day, they randomly survey 3 men and rank them by height.
- At the end of the period, they count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they randomly survey 1 man.
- At the end of the period, they count the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is around 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm (5 cm above average) is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days counted by both teams is expected to be about the same, within 5% of each other.
