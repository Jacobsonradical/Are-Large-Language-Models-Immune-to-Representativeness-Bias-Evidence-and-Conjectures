To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the sampling strategies used by the two teams.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 randomly surveys three men from the population and ranks them by height.
- At the end of the 365-day period, the team counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 randomly surveys one man from the population.
- At the end of the 365-day period, the team counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Analysis:
- Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the distribution of heights in the population is symmetric around the average of 178 cm.
- For Team 1, the middle man in the group of three will have a height that is closer to the average (178 cm) compared to the tallest and shortest men in the group.
- Therefore, the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm (which is 5 cm above the average) is lower for Team 1 compared to the probability of the single man's height being more than 183 cm for Team 2.

Based on the analysis, I think:

{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to record more days where the surveyed man's height was taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
