{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys 3 men randomly each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the 3 men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 man randomly each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has as many men above the average height as below, the probability of the middle man's height being
more than 183 cm (which is 5 cm above the average) is the same as the probability of the randomly surveyed man's height
being more than 183 cm.

Therefore, the two teams are expected to record about the same number of days (within 5% of each other).
