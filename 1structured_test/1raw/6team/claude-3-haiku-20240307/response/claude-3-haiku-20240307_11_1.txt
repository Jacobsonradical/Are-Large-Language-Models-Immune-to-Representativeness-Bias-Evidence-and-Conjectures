{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day.
- Both teams are counting the number of days where the surveyed height is more than 183 cm.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population and the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm for each team.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below, the distribution of heights is likely to be symmetric around 178 cm. This means that the probability of a man's height being above 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and counts the days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the heights are randomly distributed, the probability of the middle man's height being more than 183 cm is the same as the probability of a single man's height being more than 183 cm.

Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts the days where the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm. Again, the probability of the surveyed man's height being more than 183 cm is the same as the probability for Team 1.

Therefore, the number of days counted by both teams is likely to be about the same (within 5% of each other).
