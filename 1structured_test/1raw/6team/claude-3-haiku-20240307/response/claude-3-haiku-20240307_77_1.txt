{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 randomly surveys three men and ranks them by height.
- They count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 randomly surveys one man from the population.
- They count the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below, the probability of a man's height being greater than 183 cm is approximately the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days counted by Team 1 and Team 2 are likely to be about the same (within 5% of each other).
