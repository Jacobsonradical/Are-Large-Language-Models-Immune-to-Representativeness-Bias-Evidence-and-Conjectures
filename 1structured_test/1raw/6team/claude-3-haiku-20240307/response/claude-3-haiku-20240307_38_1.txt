Here is my analysis:

The key information given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 randomly surveys 3 men and ranks them by height.
- At the end of 365 days, they count the total number of days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 randomly surveys 1 man.
- At the end of 365 days, they count the total number of days where the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm.

To determine which team is likely to have counted more such days:

Since there are as many men above average height as below, the middle man in Team 1's survey is likely to be around the average height of 178 cm. 

For the middle man's height to be more than 183 cm, the man would need to be in the top quarter of the height distribution. This is a relatively rare occurrence.

In contrast, for Team 2's single surveyed man to be taller than 183 cm, the man would only need to be in the top half of the height distribution, which is more common.

Therefore, I believe Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the surveyed man's height was taller than 183 cm.
