{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Randomly surveys 3 men each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the 3 men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Randomly surveys 1 man each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Reasoning:
1. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the
   distribution of heights is likely to be symmetric around the average height of 178 cm.
2. The probability of a man's height being more than 183 cm is the same for both teams, as they are randomly
   selecting men from the same population.
3. The difference in the number of days counted by the two teams is likely to be within 5% of each other, as the
   probability of a man's height being more than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the teams are about the same (within 5% of each other), and the answer is 3.
