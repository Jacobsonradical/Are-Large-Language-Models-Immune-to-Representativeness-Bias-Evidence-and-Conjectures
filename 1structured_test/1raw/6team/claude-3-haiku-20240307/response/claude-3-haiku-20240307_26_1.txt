{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- Each day, they randomly survey three men and rank them by height.
- At the end of 365 days, they count the number of days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they randomly survey one man.
- At the end of 365 days, they count the number of days where the height of the surveyed man is more than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of
selecting a man taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Team 1 surveys three men each day, so the probability of at least one of them being taller than 183 cm is higher
compared to Team 2, which surveys only one man each day.

However, Team 1's count will be influenced by the height of the middle man, while Team 2's count will be influenced
by the height of the single man surveyed.

Given the information provided, it is likely that the two teams will record a similar number of days where the height
of the surveyed men was taller than 183 cm, and they will be within 5% of each other.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that the two teams are about the same (within 5% of each other).
