{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- This team randomly selects 3 men each day and ranks them by height.
- They count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- This team randomly selects 1 man each day and counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is around 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days on which the condition is met should be about the same for both teams, within 5% of each other.
