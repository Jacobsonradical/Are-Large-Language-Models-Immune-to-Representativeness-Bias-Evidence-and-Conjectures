{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- Each day, they randomly survey three men and rank them by height.
- They count the total number of days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they randomly survey one man.
- They count the total number of days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the distribution of heights is symmetrical around the average of 178 cm, the probability that a randomly selected man's height is above 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the expected number of days where the height of the middle man (for Team 1) or the randomly selected man (for Team 2) is above 183 cm should be about the same.

As the question states, they should be within 5% of each other, so the answer is 3 (they are about the same).
