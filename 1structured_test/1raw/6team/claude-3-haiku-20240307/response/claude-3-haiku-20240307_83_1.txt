{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They randomly survey three men from the population each day.
- They rank the three men with respect to their height.
- At the end of the 365-day period, they count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They randomly survey one man from the population each day.
- At the end of the 365-day period, they count the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the distribution of heights is likely to be symmetric around the average. This means that the number of men whose height is above 183 cm is approximately equal to the number of men whose height is below 183 cm.

Therefore, the number of days on which the height of the middle man (for Team 1) is more than 183 cm, and the number of days on which the height of the man surveyed (for Team 2) is more than 183 cm, are expected to be about the same, within 5% of each other.

Hence, the answer is 3, indicating that the two teams are about the same (within 5% of each other) in the number of days they recorded where the height was more than 183 cm.
