{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys 3 men randomly each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 man randomly each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the
probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm (which is 5 cm above the average) is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days on which the height of the middle man (Team 1) or the surveyed man (Team 2) is taller
than 183 cm should be about the same (within 5% of each other).
