{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men each day and rank them by height.
- They count the number of days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man each day.
- They count the number of days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of
selecting a man taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Team 1 has a better chance of encountering a man taller than 183 cm, as they survey three men each day. However,
they need the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, which reduces their chances compared to Team 2.

Considering these factors, it is likely that the two teams will have about the same number of days where they
recorded a man taller than 183 cm (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, the answer is {team: 3}.
