{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They randomly survey 3 men each day and rank them by height.
- They count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They randomly survey 1 man each day.
- They count the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of the middle man in Team 1's survey having a height greater than 183 cm is the same as the probability of the single man in Team 2's survey having a height greater than 183 cm.

Therefore, the number of days counted by both teams is expected to be about the same (within 5% of each other), and the answer is 3.
