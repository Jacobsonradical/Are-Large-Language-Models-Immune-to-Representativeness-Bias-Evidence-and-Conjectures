{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day.
- Both teams are counting the number of days where the height of the surveyed man(s) is taller than 183 cm.

The key observations are:
1. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above and below the average, the median height is also 178 cm.
2. For Team 1, the middle man in their survey is likely to be close to the median height of 178 cm.
3. For Team 1, the number of days where the middle man's height is above 183 cm is likely to be around 50% of the total days (assuming a normal distribution of heights).
4. For Team 2, the probability of surveying a man taller than 183 cm is also likely to be around 50% (since the population is equally distributed above and below the median).

Therefore, the number of days counted by both teams is likely to be about the same (within 5% of each other), so the answer is 3.
