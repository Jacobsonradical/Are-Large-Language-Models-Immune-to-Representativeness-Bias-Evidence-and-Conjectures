{team: 3}

Explanation:

Based on the given information, the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- Each day, they randomly survey three men from the population.
- They rank the three men with respect to their height.
- At the end of the period (365 days), they count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they randomly survey only one man from the population.
- At the end of the period (365 days), they count the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, it is likely that the two teams will record about the same number of days (within 5% of each other) where the height of the surveyed men was taller than 183 cm.
