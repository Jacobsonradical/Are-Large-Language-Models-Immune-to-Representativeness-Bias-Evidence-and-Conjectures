{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They randomly survey 3 men from the population each day for 365 days.
- They rank the 3 men with respect to their height and count the number of days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They randomly survey 1 man from the population each day for 365 days.
- They count the number of days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height, the probability of getting a man taller than 183 cm (about 2.5 standard deviations above the mean) is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days recorded by both teams is expected to be about the same, and they are within 5% of each other.
