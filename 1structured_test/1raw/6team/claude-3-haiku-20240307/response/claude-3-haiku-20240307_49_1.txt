{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given the information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They randomly survey 3 men each day.
- They rank the 3 men with respect to their height.
- They count the total number of days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They randomly survey 1 man each day.
- They count the total number of days where the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the
probability of getting a man taller than 183 cm (which is 5 cm above the average) is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days recorded by both teams is expected to be about the same (within 5% of each other).
