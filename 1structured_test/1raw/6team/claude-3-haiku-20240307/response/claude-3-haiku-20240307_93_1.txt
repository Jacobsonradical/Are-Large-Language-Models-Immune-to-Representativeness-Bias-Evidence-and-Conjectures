To solve this problem, we need to analyze the strategy of each team and the probability of observing a man taller than 183 cm.

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They survey three men randomly each day.
- They count the number of days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.
- Since the distribution of heights is symmetric around the average, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is the probability that the man's height is in the top 50% of the population.
- Assuming a normal distribution, the probability of a man's height being above 183 cm is approximately 0.159 (based on a z-score of 0.9).
- Over 365 days, the expected number of days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm is 365 × 0.159 ≈ 58 days.

For Team 2:
- They survey one man randomly each day.
- They count the number of days where the height of the surveyed man is more than 183 cm.
- The probability of the surveyed man being taller than 183 cm is also approximately 0.159.
- Over 365 days, the expected number of days where the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm is 365 × 0.159 ≈ 58 days.

Since the expected number of days for both teams is approximately the same, we can conclude that they are about the same (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 3}
