{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given the information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- Each day, they survey 3 men and rank them by height.
- They count the total number of days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above and below average, the height of the middle man in the 3 surveyed men is likely to be close to 178 cm.
Therefore, the number of days where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm is likely to be low.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they survey 1 man.
- They count the total number of days where the height of the surveyed man is more than 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above and below average, the height of the surveyed man is likely to be close to 178 cm.
Therefore, the number of days where the surveyed man's height is more than 183 cm is likely to be low.

Since both teams are likely to have a similar number of days where the surveyed height is more than 183 cm, and the difference is likely to be within 5%, the answer is that they are about the same (within 5% of each other).
