{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys three men randomly each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys one man randomly each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of
selecting a man taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Team 1 is selecting three men each day, and the middle man's height being above 183 cm is independent of the heights
of the other two men. Therefore, the probability of the middle man's height being above 183 cm is the same as the
probability for Team 2.

Assuming the height measurements are normally distributed, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is
approximately the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days on which each team recorded a man taller than 183 cm is likely to be within 5% of each
other, and the teams are expected to have about the same count.
