{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Randomly surveys 3 men from the population each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Randomly surveys 1 man from the population each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population is evenly distributed around the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly selected man's
height being above 183 cm is the same for both teams. Therefore, the total number of days counted by both teams is expected
to be about the same, within 5% of each other.
