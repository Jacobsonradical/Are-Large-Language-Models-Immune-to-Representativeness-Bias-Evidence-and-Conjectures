{team: 3}

Explanation:

In this problem, we need to compare the number of days the two teams recorded the height of the surveyed person(s) as more than 183 cm.

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys 3 men each day and records the height of the middle man.
- Team 2 surveys 1 man each day and records the height of the surveyed person.

Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of a randomly selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

For Team 1, on any given day, the height of the middle man will be greater than 183 cm if and only if all three men surveyed have a height greater than 183 cm. This is because the middle man will be the tallest of the three.

For Team 2, on any given day, the height of the surveyed man will be greater than 183 cm if and only if the randomly selected man has a height greater than 183 cm.

Given the same probability of a man having a height greater than 183 cm, the number of days the two teams record a height greater than 183 cm should be about the same (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, the answer is {team: 3}.
