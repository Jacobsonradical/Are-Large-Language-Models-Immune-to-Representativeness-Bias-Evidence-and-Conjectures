{team: 3}

Explanation:

Since the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the distribution of heights can be assumed to be approximately normal.

In a normal distribution, about 50% of the population lies above the mean, and 50% lies below. This means that the probability of a randomly selected man having a height above 183 cm (which is about 1 standard deviation above the mean of 178 cm) is approximately 0.16.

For Team 1:
- Each day, they randomly survey 3 men and rank them by height.
- The probability that the middle man's height is above 183 cm is also approximately 0.16.
- Over the 365-day period, the expected number of days on which the middle man's height is above 183 cm is 365 × 0.16 = 58.4.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they randomly survey 1 man.
- The probability that the man's height is above 183 cm is also approximately 0.16.
- Over the 365-day period, the expected number of days on which the man's height is above 183 cm is 365 × 0.16 = 58.4.

Since the expected number of days for both teams is the same (within 5% of each other), the two teams are likely to have recorded about the same number of such days.
