{team: 3}

Explanation:

Based on the given information, the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They randomly survey 3 men each day for 365 days.
- They rank the 3 men by height and count the number of days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Since the height distribution is symmetric around the average of 178 cm, the probability that a randomly selected man's height is above 183 cm is the same for both Team 1 and Team 2.

For Team 2:
- They randomly survey 1 man each day for 365 days.
- They count the number of days where the height of the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.

Since the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams, the total number of days counted by the two teams should be about the same, within 5% of each other.

Therefore, the answer is 3, indicating that the two teams are about the same (within 5% of each other).
