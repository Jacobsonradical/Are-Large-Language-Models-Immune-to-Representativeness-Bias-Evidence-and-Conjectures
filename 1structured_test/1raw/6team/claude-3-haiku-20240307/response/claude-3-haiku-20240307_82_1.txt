{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys 3 men randomly each day.
- Ranks the 3 men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 man randomly each day.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population is distributed symmetrically around the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly
selected man having a height greater than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Assuming the sampling is random, the expected number of days on which the height of the middle man in Team 1's
survey is more than 183 cm should be approximately the same as the expected number of days on which the height of the
man surveyed by Team 2 is more than 183 cm.

Therefore, it is likely that the two teams will record about the same number of such days, within 5% of each other.
