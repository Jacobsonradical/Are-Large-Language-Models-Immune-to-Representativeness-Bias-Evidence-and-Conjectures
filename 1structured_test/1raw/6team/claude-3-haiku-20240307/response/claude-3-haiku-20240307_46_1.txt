{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Team 1 surveys 3 men randomly each day for 365 days.
- They rank the 3 men by height and count the number of days where the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Team 2 surveys 1 man randomly each day for 365 days.
- They count the number of days where the height of the surveyed man is taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm (which is about 2.8 standard deviations above the mean) is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days counted by both teams will be about the same, and they are within 5% of each other.
