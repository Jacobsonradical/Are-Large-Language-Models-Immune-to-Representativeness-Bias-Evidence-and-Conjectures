{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men per day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 surveys one man per day.
- Both teams count the number of days when the height of the surveyed man(s) is taller than 183 cm.

To determine which team counted more such days or if they are about the same, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population.

Since there are as many men above the average height as below, the height distribution is likely to be symmetric around the average of 178 cm. This means that the number of men taller than 183 cm (the height threshold) is approximately equal to the number of men shorter than 173 cm (183 cm - 10 cm).

For Team 1, they survey three men per day and count the number of days when the middle man's height is taller than 183 cm. Since the height distribution is symmetric, the likelihood of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is the same for Team 1 and Team 2.

Therefore, the two teams are likely to have recorded about the same number of days (within 5% of each other) when the surveyed man(s) were taller than 183 cm.
