{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them based on their height.
- Team 2 surveys one man each day.
- The teams are counting the number of days where the height of the surveyed man(s) is taller than 183 cm.

To determine which team will count more such days, we need to consider the probability distribution of the heights of the
men in the population.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above and below the average, the distribution of heights is
likely to be symmetric around 178 cm. This means that the probability of a man's height being above 183 cm is approximately
equal to the probability of a man's height being below 173 cm (since 183 cm is 5 cm above the average and 173 cm is 5 cm
below the average).

For Team 1, they are surveying three men each day and looking at the height of the middle man. The probability of the
middle man's height being above 183 cm is the same as the probability of a randomly selected man's height being above
183 cm.

For Team 2, they are surveying one man each day and looking at whether his height is above 183 cm. The probability of
this is also the same as the probability of a randomly selected man's height being above 183 cm.

Therefore, the number of days counted by both teams is expected to be about the same (within 5% of each other), as they
are both based on the same underlying probability of a man's height being above 183 cm.
