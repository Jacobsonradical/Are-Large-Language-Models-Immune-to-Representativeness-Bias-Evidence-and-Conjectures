{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- In a period of 365 days, they randomly survey three men from the population each day.
- They rank the three men with respect to their height and count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- In the same period, they randomly survey one man from the population each day.
- They count the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has as many men above average height as below average height, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm (which is about 5 cm above the average) is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days on which each team recorded a man taller than 183 cm should be about the same, and they are within 5% of each other.
