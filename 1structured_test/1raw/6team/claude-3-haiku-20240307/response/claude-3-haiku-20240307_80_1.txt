{team: 3}

Explanation:
Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men from the population every day and ranks them by height.
- Team 2 randomly surveys one man from the population every day.
- Both teams count the total number of days where the surveyed man(s) had a height taller than 183 cm.

To determine which team will count more such days, we need to consider the probability of a man's height being above 183 cm.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below, the median height is also 178 cm. This means that 50% of the men have a height above 178 cm.

The probability of a randomly selected man having a height above 183 cm is less than 50%, as 183 cm is higher than the average.

For Team 1, they survey three men each day and count the days where the middle man's height is above 183 cm. The probability of the middle man's height being above 183 cm is less than 50%.

For Team 2, they survey one man each day and count the days where the man's height is above 183 cm. The probability of a randomly selected man having a height above 183 cm is less than 50%.

Since both teams are using a similar probability of a man's height being above 183 cm, the number of days counted by the two teams is expected to be about the same (within 5% of each other).

Therefore, the answer is {team: 3}.
