{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Each day, Team 1 randomly surveys three men and ranks them by height.
- At the end of the period (365 days), they count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Each day, Team 2 randomly surveys one man.
- At the end of the period (365 days), they count the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the average height is around 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below average, the probability of a man having a height greater than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days counted by Team 1 and Team 2 is expected to be about the same, within 5% of each other.
