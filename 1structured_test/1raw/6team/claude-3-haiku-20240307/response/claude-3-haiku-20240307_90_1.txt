{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.
- Team 1 randomly surveys three men from the population and ranks them by height each day for 365 days.
- Team 2 randomly surveys one man from the population each day for 365 days.
- Both teams are counting the number of days where the height of the man(s) they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Reasoning:
1. Since there are as many men above average height as below, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm (which is about 5 cm above the average) is the same for both teams.
2. Team 1 selects three men each day, and the middle man's height is what they count. Team 2 selects only one man each day.
3. Although Team 1 has a larger sample size (3 men per day), the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is the same as the probability of the single man selected by Team 2 being taller than 183 cm.
4. Therefore, the total number of days where the surveyed height was taller than 183 cm should be about the same for both teams, and within 5% of each other.

Hence, the answer is {team: 3}.
