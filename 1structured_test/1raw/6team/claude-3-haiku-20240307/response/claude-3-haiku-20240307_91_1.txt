{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- They randomly survey 3 men each day for 365 days.
- They rank the 3 men with respect to their height.
- They count the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- They randomly survey 1 man each day for 365 days.
- They count the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of
surveying a man taller than 183 cm (which is 5 cm above the average) should be the same for both teams.

Therefore, it is expected that the number of days on which each team records a man taller than 183 cm should be
about the same, within a 5% difference.
