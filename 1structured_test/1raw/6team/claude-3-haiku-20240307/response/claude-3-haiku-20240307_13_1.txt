{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given information:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

For Team 1:
- Each day, they randomly survey three men and rank them by height.
- At the end of 365 days, they count the total number of days when the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

For Team 2:
- Each day, they randomly survey one man.
- At the end of 365 days, they count the total number of days when the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population has an equal number of men above and below the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a randomly
selected man being taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

Therefore, the number of days counted by both teams is expected to be about the same (within 5% of each other), as they are
both randomly selecting men from the same population.
