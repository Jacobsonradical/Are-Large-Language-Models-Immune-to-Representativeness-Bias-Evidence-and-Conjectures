{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys 3 men randomly each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the three men with respect to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 man randomly each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

To determine which team will count more such days, we need to consider the distribution of heights in the population.

Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below average, the distribution of heights is likely to be symmetric around the mean. This means that the number of men with a height greater than 183 cm is approximately equal to the number of men with a height less than 173 cm.

For Team 1, the middle man in the group of 3 surveyed each day will have a height that is likely to be close to the average of the 3 heights. Since the heights are symmetrically distributed around the average, the number of days where the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm will be approximately the same as the number of days where at least one of the three men has a height greater than 183 cm.

For Team 2, the single man surveyed each day will have a height that is randomly selected from the population. The number of days where the surveyed man's height is greater than 183 cm will be approximately the same as the number of days where the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm for Team 1.

Therefore, the number of days counted by both teams is likely to be about the same (within 5% of each other), so the answer is 3.
