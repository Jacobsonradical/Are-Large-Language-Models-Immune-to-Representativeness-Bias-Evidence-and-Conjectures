{team: 3}

Explanation:

Given:
- The average height of men in the population is around 178 cm.
- There are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average.

Team 1:
- Surveys 3 random men from the population each day for 365 days.
- Ranks the 3 men according to their height.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm.

Team 2:
- Surveys 1 random man from the population each day for 365 days.
- Counts the total number of days on which the height of the surveyed man was taller than 183 cm.

Since the population is symmetrically distributed around the average height of 178 cm, the probability of a man's height
being above 183 cm is the same for both teams. Therefore, the total number of days on which the height of the middle
man (for Team 1) or the surveyed man (for Team 2) is more than 183 cm should be about the same, within 5% of each other.
