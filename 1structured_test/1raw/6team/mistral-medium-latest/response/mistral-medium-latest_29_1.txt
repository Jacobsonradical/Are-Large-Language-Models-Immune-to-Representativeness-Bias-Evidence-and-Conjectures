{team: 2}

The reasoning behind this is that Team 1 is surveying groups of three men every day, and they only count the day if the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the middle man's height is more than the smallest man's height by definition, it's likely that the middle man's height is closer to the average height (178 cm) than the tallest man's height. Therefore, it's less likely that the middle man's height will be more than 183 cm compared to the height of a randomly selected man from the population, which is what Team 2 is counting. So, Team 2 is likely to count more such days.
