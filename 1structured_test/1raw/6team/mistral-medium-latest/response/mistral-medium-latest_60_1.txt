{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Team 1 is selecting three men every day and ranking them by height. The middle man's height needs to be greater than 183 cm for that day to be counted.
2. Team 2 is selecting only one man every day, and if his height is greater than 183 cm, that day is counted.
3. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average height as there are below, we can infer that half of the population has a height greater than 178 cm.
4. Without any further information about the distribution of heights, we can assume that the distribution is symmetrical around the average height. In this case, it is reasonable to expect that about 1/4 of the population has a height greater than 183 cm (half of the men above the average height).
5. Therefore, Team 2 has a 1 in 4 chance of selecting a man taller than 183 cm each day, leading to an expected count of (1/4) \* 365 = 91.25 days.
6. Team 1, on the other hand, selects three men every day. The probability that the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm is lower than the probability for Team 2 because the tallest man could be any of the three men. Without knowing the exact distribution of heights, it is difficult to calculate the exact probability, but we can expect it to be less than 1/4.
7. Because of this, it is reasonable to assume that Team 2 counted more days with men taller than 183 cm than Team 1.
