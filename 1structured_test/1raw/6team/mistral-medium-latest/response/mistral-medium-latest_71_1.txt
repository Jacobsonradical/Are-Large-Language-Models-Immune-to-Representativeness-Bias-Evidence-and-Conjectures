{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a height greater than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 surveys only one man each day, and since the men are selected randomly, there is a higher chance of selecting a taller man from the population. On the other hand, Team 1 surveys three men each day and only counts the days when the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm. This reduces the probability of counting a day as compared to Team 2, since even if one of the men is taller than 183 cm, it may not necessarily be the middle man. Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more such days.
