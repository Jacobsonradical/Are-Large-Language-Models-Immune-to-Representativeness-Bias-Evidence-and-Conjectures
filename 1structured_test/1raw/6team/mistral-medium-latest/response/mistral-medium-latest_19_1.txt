{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days with a man taller than 183 cm. This is because they are sampling one man per day and only need to find one man above the threshold height, while Team 1 is sampling three men per day and needs to find at least one man taller than 183 cm whose relative height is in the middle of the group. Since the average height is 178 cm and half of the men are below average, it is statistically less likely for Team 1 to find a man taller than 183 cm, especially one who is also the middle height in their group of three.
