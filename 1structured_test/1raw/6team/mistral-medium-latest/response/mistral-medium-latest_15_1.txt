{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1 is looking at the height of the middle man among three randomly selected men each day. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average height as there are below it, there is a higher chance that the middle man's height will be closer to the average height of 178 cm than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2, which surveys only one man each day, has a higher chance of encountering a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.

Moreover, even if Team 1 were to encounter three men all taller than 183 cm on a given day, they would still only count that day once in their tally, whereas Team 2 could potentially count multiple instances of men taller than 183 cm on the same day if they were surveying multiple men per day. Since Team 1 is only looking at the middle man's height, it is less likely that they will count as many days with men taller than 183 cm as Team 2.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm than Team 1.
