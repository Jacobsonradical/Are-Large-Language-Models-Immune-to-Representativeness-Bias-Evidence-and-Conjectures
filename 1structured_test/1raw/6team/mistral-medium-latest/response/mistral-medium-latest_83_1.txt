{team: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that Team 2 has a higher chance of finding men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1. This is because Team 1 always selects three men and looks for the middle one's height, which has a lower probability of being above 183 cm compared to randomly selecting just one man like Team 2 does. The difference in probabilities should result in Team 2 counting more such days than Team 1.
