{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with heights above 183 cm. This is because they are only looking at one individual per day, and since 183 cm is above the average height (178 cm), we can assume that there are more individuals below this height than above it. On the other hand, Team 1 is looking at groups of three individuals and only counting days when the middle person has a height greater than 183 cm. This means that at least one other person in the group must also have a height above 183 cm, making it less likely for Team 1 to record a "success" compared to Team 2.
