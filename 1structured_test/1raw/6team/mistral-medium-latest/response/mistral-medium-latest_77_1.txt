{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days because they are surveying three times as many men as Team 1 over the course of a year (3 men/day \* 365 days = 1095 men for Team 1 versus 1 man/day \* 365 days = 365 men for Team 2). Although Team 1 is looking at the middle man's height, it is still less likely that the middle man will be taller than 183 cm compared to the height of any randomly selected man from the population. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of counting more days with a man taller than 183 cm.

However, without specific information about the distribution of heights in the population, it is impossible to say for certain whether the difference between the two teams' counts would be within 5%. The assumption that Team 2 will have counted more such days is based on the likelihood that they surveyed a larger sample of the population.
