{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because they are only looking for men taller than 183 cm, while Team 1 is only counting days where the middle man out of three surveyed men is taller than 183 cm. Since there are equal numbers of men above and below average height (178 cm) in the population, and the average height is less than 183 cm, it is more likely that Team 2 will find a man taller than 183 cm on any given day than it is for Team 1 to find a middle man taller than 183 cm.

Additionally, Team 1's chances of finding a middle man taller than 183 cm would depend on the heights of the other two men surveyed on that day, while Team 2 only needs to find one man taller than 183 cm to count that day. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher probability of counting more such days than Team 1.
