{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days with heights over 183 cm. This is because they are surveying one man each day and only need that one man to be taller than 183 cm to count it as a successful day. In contrast, Team 1 is surveying three men each day and only counts it as a successful day if the middle man is taller than 183 cm. Since there are as many men below average height as above average height, it is statistically less likely for Team 1 to find a middle man taller than 183 cm than for Team 2 to find a single man taller than 183 cm.

However, it's important to note that the actual difference in the number of successful days will depend on the distribution of heights in the population and the sample size of each team. Without this information, it's impossible to say for certain which team recorded more successful days. However, based on the information provided, it's more likely that Team 2 recorded more successful days than Team 1.
