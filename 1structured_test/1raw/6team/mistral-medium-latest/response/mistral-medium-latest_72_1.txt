{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because they are only surveying one man per day, and their goal is to find any man taller than 183 cm. Team 1, on the other hand, is surveying three men per day and only counting days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm. This means that even if one or two of the men are taller than 183 cm, it won't count towards Team 1's total unless the middle man is also taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as below, it's statistically less likely for the middle man in a random group of three to be taller than 183 cm compared to the chance of randomly selecting any man from the population to be taller than 183 cm.
