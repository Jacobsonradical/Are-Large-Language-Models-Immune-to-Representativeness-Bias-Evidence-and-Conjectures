{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because they are only looking at one man per day, and the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of selecting a middle man taller than 183 cm from a group of three men. This is due to the fact that the middle man in a group of three is more likely to be close to the average height of 178 cm, while a man selected at random from the population has an equal chance of being above or below the average height.

Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of selecting a man taller than 183 cm, and is likely to have counted more such days than Team 1.
