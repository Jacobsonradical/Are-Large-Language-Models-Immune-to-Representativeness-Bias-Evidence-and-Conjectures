{team: 2}

Here's my reasoning:

1. Team 1 surveys three men per day and only counts the day if the middle man's height is above 183 cm. Since the middle man's height must be between the heights of the other two men, there is a lower chance that his height will exceed 183 cm compared to randomly selecting any man from the population.
2. Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man per day and counts the day if that man's height is above 183 cm. This gives them a higher chance of recording a day as compared to Team 1 since they're not limiting themselves to the middle man's height.
3. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Team 2 recorded more days with a height above 183 cm than Team 1.
