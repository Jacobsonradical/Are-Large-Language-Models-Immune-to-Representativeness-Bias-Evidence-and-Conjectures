{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because they are only looking at one man per day, and the probability of randomly selecting a man taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of randomly selecting a group of three men where the middle man is taller than 183 cm. The latter event requires not only that the middle man is taller than 183 cm, but also that the other two men are either shorter or the same height as the middle man. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of recording more such days.
