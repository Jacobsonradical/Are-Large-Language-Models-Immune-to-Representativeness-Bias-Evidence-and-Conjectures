{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed is over 183 cm. This is because they are selecting men individually, rather than in groups of three, and the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is higher when considering the entire population rather than just the tallest or middle man from a group of three. Additionally, the fact that there are as many men below average height as there are above suggests that the distribution of heights is symmetric around the average, further increasing the likelihood that Team 2 will encounter more men over 183 cm.

To provide a rough estimate, assuming a normal distribution of heights, the probability of selecting a man over 183 cm is about 0.16 or 16%. For Team 1, the probability of selecting the middle man as taller than 183 cm is the probability that at least one of the other two men is also taller than 183 cm, which is about 0.27 or 27%. However, since Team 1 is only counting the middle man, their expected number of days where the middle man is over 183 cm is only half of this, or about 13.6%, which is still lower than Team 2's expected count of 16%. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed is over 183 cm.
