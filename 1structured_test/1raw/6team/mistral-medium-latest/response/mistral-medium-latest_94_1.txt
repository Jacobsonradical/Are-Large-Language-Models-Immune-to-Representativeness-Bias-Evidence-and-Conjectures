{team: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that Team 2 has a higher chance of surveying a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1. This is because Team 1 is looking for the middle-ranked man among three randomly chosen men to be taller than 183 cm, which is less likely than selecting one man who is taller than 183 cm.

In other words, even though Team 1 surveys more men overall, they are not specifically looking for tall men, and the requirement for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm reduces their chances compared to Team 2, which focuses on finding any man taller than 183 cm.

Hence, Team 2 is expected to record more days with men taller than 183 cm.
