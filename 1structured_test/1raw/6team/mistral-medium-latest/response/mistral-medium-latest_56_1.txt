{team: 2}

Explanation:

The average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men above this height as there are below it. This means that about 50% of the men in the population are taller than 178 cm. However, the question asks for the number of days on which a man's height is more than 183 cm, which is significantly taller than the average height.

Team 1 surveys three men each day and looks for days on which the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the middle man is, by definition, taller than the shortest man but shorter than the tallest man, it is less likely that his height will be more than 183 cm compared to a randomly selected man from the population. In fact, since only about 50% of men are taller than the average height of 178 cm, it is likely that even fewer than 50% of men are taller than 183 cm. Therefore, it is unlikely that Team 1 will count many days on which the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.

On the other hand, Team 2 surveys only one man each day and looks for days on which his height is more than 183 cm. Since they are selecting men randomly from the population, they have a higher chance of finding a man who is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1. In fact, since about 50% of men are taller than the average height of 178 cm, it is likely that at least some percentage of men are taller than 183 cm. Therefore, it is likely that Team 2 will count more days on which a man's height is more than 183 cm compared to Team 1.

In summary, since Team 2 has a higher chance of selecting a man who is taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1, it is likely that they will count more days on which a man's height is more than 183 cm. Therefore, the answer is {team: 2}.
