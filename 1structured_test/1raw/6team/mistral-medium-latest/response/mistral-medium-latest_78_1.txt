{team: 2}

Explanation:

Team 1 randomly selects three men each day and only counts the day if the middle man's height is over 183 cm. Since the middle man's height is above average (178 cm) by definition, it is more likely that fewer days will meet this criterion compared to Team 2's, which simply counts any man over 183 cm, regardless of his ranking among the three men selected that day.

Therefore, Team 2 is expected to record more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
