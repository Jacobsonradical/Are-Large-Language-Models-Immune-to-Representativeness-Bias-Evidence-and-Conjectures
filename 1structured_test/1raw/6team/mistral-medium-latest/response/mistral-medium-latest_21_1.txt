{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1 is surveying three men every day and only counting the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm, whereas Team 2 is surveying only one man every day and counting every day that the man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and half of the men are taller than average, it is statistically more likely that Team 2 will encounter more men taller than 183 cm than Team 1 will encounter as the middle man out of three men.

Note: This answer assumes that the distribution of heights in the population is symmetric around the average height of 178 cm, and that the selection of men by both teams is truly random and independent. If these assumptions are not met, the outcome may be different.
