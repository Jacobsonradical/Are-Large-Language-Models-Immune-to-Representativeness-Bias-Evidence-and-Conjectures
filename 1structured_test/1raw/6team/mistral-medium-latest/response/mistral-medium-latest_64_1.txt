{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Team 1 surveys 3 men each day, while Team 2 surveys only 1 man each day.
2. Team 1 is only counting days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm. Since the men are ranked in order of height, this means that not only the middle man but also the tallest man should be taller than 183 cm for that day to be counted.
3. Team 2 is simply counting days when the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm, regardless of his rank among other men.
4. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of recording a day as a "success" (i.e., a day when the man's height is above 183 cm) compared to Team 1, which has the additional requirement of the middle man's height being above 183 cm.
5. Furthermore, since Team 1 surveys three times as many men as Team 2 each day, even if their daily "success" rate was equal, Team 2 would still record more "success" days overall.
6. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that Team 2 counted more days with men taller than 183 cm than Team 1 did.
