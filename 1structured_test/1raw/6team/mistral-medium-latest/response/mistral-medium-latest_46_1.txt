{team: 2}

Explanation:

Team 1 is sampling three men each day and considering only the middle height. Since half of the men in the population are taller than average (178 cm), it's less likely that the middle man in a randomly selected group of three men will be taller than 183 cm.

On the other hand, Team 2 is sampling one man each day and considering his height. Since they are only looking at one man at a time, they have a higher probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to count more days with a man taller than 183 cm.
