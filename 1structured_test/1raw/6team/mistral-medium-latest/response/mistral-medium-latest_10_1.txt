{team: 2}

The reasoning behind this is that Team 2 has a higher chance of recording a day with a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1. This is because Team 1 only counts a day if the middle man out of the three surveyed men is taller than 183 cm, while Team 2 counts a day as long as the single man surveyed is taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average height as there are below it, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm in a single selection is higher than the probability of selecting three men and having the middle one be taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to record more such days.
