{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because they are only looking at one man per day, and the chance of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is higher than the chance of selecting a man who is both taller than average (178 cm) and taller than 183 cm when looking at three men (as Team 1 is doing). The fact that there are as many men above the average height as below it does not change this, as the threshold of 183 cm is still higher than the average.

Therefore, Team 2 has a higher probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm each day, and over the course of 365 days, they are likely to have counted more such days than Team 1.

Note: This answer assumes that the height distribution in the population is continuous and not discrete, and that the heights of men in the population follow a normal distribution or a similar distribution with a relatively small standard deviation. If the distribution is significantly different, the answer may change.
