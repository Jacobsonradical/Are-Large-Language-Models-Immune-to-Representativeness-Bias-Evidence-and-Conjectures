{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a height over 183 cm.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above the average as below it, the distribution of heights should be symmetric around the average.
2. When Team 1 surveys three men, they will rarely pick three men who are all taller than 183 cm (which would result in the middle man being taller than 183 cm). This is because only a small proportion of the population is taller than 183 cm.
3. Team 2, on the other hand, has a higher chance of picking a man taller than 183 cm each day since they are only surveying one man at a time. Even though the probability of selecting a tall man is low, doing it every day for 365 days increases the overall number of tall men they find.
4. Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a height over 183 cm than Team 1.
