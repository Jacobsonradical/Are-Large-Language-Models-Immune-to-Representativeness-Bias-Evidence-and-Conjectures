{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1 is only considering the middle man in their surveys of three men, whereas Team 2 is considering every man they survey. Since there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, it is more likely that Team 2 will encounter more men who are taller than 183 cm than Team 1 will encounter as the middle man in their groups of three.
