{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with a height greater than 183 cm. This is because they are only surveying one man per day, and the probability of that one man being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of the middle man in a group of three men being taller than 183 cm. Since half of the men in the population are taller than average, and the average height is 178 cm, it follows that the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is significantly less than 50%. Therefore, in a group of three men, the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of selecting one man who is taller than 183 cm.

Note: This answer assumes that the selection of men by both teams is random, and that there are no other factors affecting the results. Additionally, the 5% difference mentioned in the question is not relevant to the comparison, as the expected difference between the two teams' results is likely to be much larger than 5%.
