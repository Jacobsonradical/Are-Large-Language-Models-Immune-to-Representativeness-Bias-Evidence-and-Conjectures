{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days on which the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 is only considering men who are taller than the threshold, whereas Team 1 is considering groups of three men and only counting days on which the middle man is taller than the threshold. Since the average height is 178 cm and half of the men are below average, it is less likely that the middle man in a randomly selected group of three will be taller than 183 cm compared to the chance of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days.
