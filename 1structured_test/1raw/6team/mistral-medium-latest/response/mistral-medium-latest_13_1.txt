{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days because they are surveying one man each day and only need that one man's height to be taller than 183 cm to count as a "success." In contrast, Team 1 is surveying three men each day and only counts a day as a "success" if the height of the middle man is more than 183 cm. This additional requirement makes it less likely for Team 1 to have as many "successes" as Team 2.

To estimate the difference more quantitatively, we can assume that the heights of men in the population are normally distributed with mean 178 cm and some standard deviation Ïƒ. Then the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm is approximately \(1 - \Phi\left(\frac{183 - 178}{\sigma}\right)\), where \(\Phi\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Since the average height is 178 cm and half of the men are taller than this height, we can estimate that \(\sigma \approx 7\) cm. Then the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm is approximately \(1 - \Phi\left(\frac{5}{7}\right) \approx 0.19\).

For Team 2, the expected number of "successes" in 365 days is therefore \(0.19 \times 365 \approx 70\).

For Team 1, the probability of a "success" on any given day is the probability that the middle man is taller than 183 cm, which is the probability that at least two of the three men are taller than 183 cm. This probability can be calculated using the binomial distribution, and it turns out to be approximately \(3(0.19)^2(0.81) + (0.19)^3 \approx 0.08\). Therefore, the expected number of "successes" for Team 1 in 365 days is \(0.08 \times 365 \approx 30\).

Therefore, we can expect Team 2 to have counted significantly more days with men taller than 183 cm than Team 1.
