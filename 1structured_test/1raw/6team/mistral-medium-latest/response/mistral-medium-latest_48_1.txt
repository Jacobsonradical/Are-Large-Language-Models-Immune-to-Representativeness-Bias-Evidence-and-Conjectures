{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was over 183 cm compared to Team 1. This is because when Team 1 selects three men each day, they are ranking them based on their height. Therefore, even if one or two of the men have a height greater than 183 cm, the middle man may still not exceed this height. On the other hand, Team 2 is only selecting one man each day, so every time they select a man who is taller than 183 cm, it will be counted. Since both teams are randomly selecting men from the same population, it is expected that Team 2 will have a higher count of days where the height of the man surveyed is over 183 cm.
