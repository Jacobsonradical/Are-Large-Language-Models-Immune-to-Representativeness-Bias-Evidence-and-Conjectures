{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because when Team 1 surveys three men each day, they are more likely to have at least one man with a height below the average of 178 cm, which would make it less likely for the middle man to have a height above 183 cm. In contrast, Team 2 only surveys one man each day, so their chances of surveying a man taller than 183 cm are higher than Team 1's chances of having the middle man be taller than 183 cm.

To estimate the difference in the number of days counted by the two teams, we can use some probability calculations. Let's assume that the heights of men in the population are normally distributed with a mean of 178 cm and a standard deviation of 7 cm (this is just an assumption, but it's a reasonable one based on typical height distributions). Then, the probability that a randomly chosen man has a height above 183 cm is about 0.1587 (this can be calculated using a normal distribution table or a calculator with a normal distribution function).

Since Team 2 surveys one man each day, the expected number of days on which they record a height above 183 cm is 365 \* 0.1587 = 57.92.

On the other hand, when Team 1 surveys three men each day, the probability that the middle man has a height above 183 cm is lower than the probability that any one of the three men has a height above 183 cm. Specifically, the probability that the middle man is the tallest or the shortest among the three men is 2/3, and the probability that the middle man is the middle one is 1/3. If the middle man is the tallest or the shortest, then his height is above 183 cm if and only if all three men have heights above 183 cm. If the middle man is the middle one, then his height is above 183 cm if and only if both the tallest and the shortest men have heights above 183 cm. Therefore, the probability that the middle man has a height above 183 cm is:

P(middle man > 183) = P(all three men > 183) \* (2/3) + P(tallest and shortest > 183 and middle < 183) \* (1/3)
= (0.1587)^3 \* (2/3) + [P(tallest > 183)^2 \* P(middle < 183)] \* (1/3)
= (0.1587)^3 \* (2/3) + [(1 - P(middle > 183))^2 \* P(middle < 183)] \* (1/3)
< (0.1587)^3 \* (2/3) + [(1 - 0.5)^2 \* 0.5] \* (1/3)
= 0.0035 + 0.0417
= 0.0452

Therefore, the expected number of days on which Team 1 records a height above 183 cm for the middle man is 365 \* 0.0452 = 16.45.

Therefore, Team 2 is expected to record about 41.47 more days with a height above 183 cm compared to Team 1, which is a difference of over 70%. This suggests that Team 2 is likely to have recorded significantly more days with a height above 183 cm than Team 1.
