{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because they are selecting one man at random each day, and the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of selecting a group of three men where the middle man is taller than 183 cm.

In fact, the expected number of days where Team 1 finds a middle man with height greater than 183 cm is less than the expected number of days where Team 2 finds a tall man. This is because for Team 1, in order for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, both the tallest and the middle man must be taller than 183 cm. However, for Team 2, only one man needs to be taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, we can expect Team 2 to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm.
