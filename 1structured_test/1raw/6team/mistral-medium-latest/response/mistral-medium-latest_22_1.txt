{team: 2}

Explanation:

Team 1 is sampling three men per day and only counting days where the middle man's height is over 183 cm. Since the middle man needs to be taller than both the shorter and the taller man in the sample, this event is less likely to occur compared to Team 2's sampling method.

Team 2, on the other hand, is sampling just one man per day and counting the days where that man's height is over 183 cm. This event is more likely to occur than Team 1's event since they only need one man to be taller than 183 cm, rather than having a man taller than two other men in the sample.

Therefore, Team 2 is likely to record more days where the height of the man surveyed is over 183 cm compared to Team 1.
