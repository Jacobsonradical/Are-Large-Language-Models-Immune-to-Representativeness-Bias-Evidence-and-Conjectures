{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because they are only looking for men taller than 183 cm, whereas Team 1 is specifically looking for the middle man in their group of three to be taller than 183 cm. Since the height distribution is symmetric around the average height of 178 cm, we would expect that roughly 25% of men in the population are taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 would be expected to find a man taller than 183 cm on about 25% of days, while Team 1 would only find the middle man taller than 183 cm on a much smaller fraction of days (since the probability of all three men being taller than 183 cm is much lower than the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm). Thus, Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days.
