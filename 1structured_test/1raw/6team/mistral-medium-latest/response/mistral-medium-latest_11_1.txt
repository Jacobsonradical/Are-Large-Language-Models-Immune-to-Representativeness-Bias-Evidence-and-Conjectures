{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with heights above 183 cm. This is because they are sampling one man per day from the entire population, so their sample includes both taller and shorter men. In contrast, Team 1 is only considering the middle man's height in each sample of three men, which reduces their chances of selecting a man taller than 183 cm since the other two men in the sample are likely to be above or below average height. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm, leading to more recorded days with heights above this threshold.
