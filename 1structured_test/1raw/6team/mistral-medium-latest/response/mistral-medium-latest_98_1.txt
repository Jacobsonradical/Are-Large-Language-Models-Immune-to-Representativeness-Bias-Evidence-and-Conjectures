{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days on which the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 surveys one man per day and only needs that one man to be taller than 183 cm to count as a success, whereas Team 1 surveys three men per day and only counts it as a success if the middle man is taller than 183 cm. Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and only half of the men are taller than average, it is statistically more likely that Team 2 will have more successes than Team 1.
