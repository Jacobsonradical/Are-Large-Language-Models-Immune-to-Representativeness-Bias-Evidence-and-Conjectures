{team: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that Team 2 has a higher chance of finding men taller than 183 cm than Team 1. Team 1 always compares the heights of the three men they survey each day and only counts it if the middle man's height is above 183 cm. However, Team 2 simply needs to find one man per day who is taller than 183 cm. Since there are men in the population taller than 183 cm, Team 2 has a higher probability of encountering such men than Team 1, who must find a man tall enough to be the middle height in a group of three.
