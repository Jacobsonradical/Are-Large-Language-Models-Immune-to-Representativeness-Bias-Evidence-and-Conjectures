{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was over 183 cm. This is because they are selecting one man at random each day from the entire population, so they have a higher chance of selecting a taller man compared to Team 1, which is always selecting the middle man from a group of three randomly selected men.

To see why this is the case, consider that the middle man selected by Team 1 will have a height that is above the shortest man but below the tallest man in their group of three. Since half of the men in the population are below average height (178 cm), it is likely that the shortest man in each group of three will also be below this height. Therefore, the middle man's height will be above 183 cm only if the tallest man in the group is also above this height. On the other hand, Team 2 has a chance of selecting any man in the population, including the tallest men who would not be selected as the middle man by Team 1.

Of course, this is just a probabilistic argument, and the actual numbers could vary depending on the specific distribution of heights in the population. However, based on the information given, it seems more likely that Team 2 would have counted more days with heights over 183 cm.
