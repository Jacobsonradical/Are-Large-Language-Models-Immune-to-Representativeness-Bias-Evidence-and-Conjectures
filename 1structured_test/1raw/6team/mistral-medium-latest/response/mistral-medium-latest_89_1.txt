{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because when Team 1 surveys three men, the middle man's height is more likely to be closer to the average height of 178 cm than the height of a randomly selected man from the population. Since there are equal numbers of men with heights above and below average, the chance of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is higher for Team 2, which surveys only one man per day. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days.
