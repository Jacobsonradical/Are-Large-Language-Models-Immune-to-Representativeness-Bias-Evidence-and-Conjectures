{team: 2}

The reasoning behind this is that Team 2 has a higher chance of encountering a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1. Team 1 always selects three men and only counts the day if the middle man's height is above 183 cm. This means that the two men on either side of the middle man could have heights below or above 183 cm, and it would still count as long as the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm.

However, Team 2 selects only one man per day, and they count it if the man's height is above 183 cm. Therefore, they have a higher probability of counting more days with men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1, which has additional conditions to meet.
