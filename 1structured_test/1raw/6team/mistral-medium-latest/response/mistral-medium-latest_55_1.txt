{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days. Here's the reasoning:

1. Team 1 surveys three men each day and only counts it if the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the middle man is taller than only one of the other two men surveyed that day, there's a 2 out of 3 chance that the middle man's height is not more than 183 cm (assuming a uniform distribution around the average height).
2. Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man each day and counts it if that man's height is more than 183 cm.
3. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher probability of counting a day as a "success" compared to Team 1, since they only need one man's height to be above the threshold, while Team 1 needs the middle man's height to be above the threshold.

It's important to note that this reasoning assumes a uniform distribution of heights around the average. If the distribution is skewed or has multiple peaks, the results might be different. However, based on the information provided, it's reasonable to conclude that Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days.
