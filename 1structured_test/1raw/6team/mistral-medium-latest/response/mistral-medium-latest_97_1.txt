{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the height was over 183 cm. This is because when Team 1 surveys three men, the middle man's height being over 183 cm requires that at least one other man's height also be over 183 cm. However, when Team 2 surveys only one man per day, they only need that one man's height to be over 183 cm to count it. Since there are an equal number of men above and below average height (178 cm), the chance of selecting a man over 183 cm is higher for Team 2 than for Team 1.

The difference in counts would likely be more than 5%, given the nature of the sampling and the difference in requirements for counting a day. Therefore, Team 2 is expected to record more such days.
