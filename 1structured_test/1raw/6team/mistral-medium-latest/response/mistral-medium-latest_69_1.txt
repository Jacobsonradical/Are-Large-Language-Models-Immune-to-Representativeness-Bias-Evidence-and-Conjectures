{team: 2}

Explanation:
Team 1 is surveying three men each day and only counting the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the men are chosen randomly, it is less likely that the middle man will always be taller than 183 cm compared to the other two men.

On the other hand, Team 2 is surveying only one man each day, and they are counting the days when the man's height is more than 183 cm. This means that they have a higher chance of finding a man taller than 183 cm, since they are not limited to the middle man's height.

Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 counted more days than Team 1.
