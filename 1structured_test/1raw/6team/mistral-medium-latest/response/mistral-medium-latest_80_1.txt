{team: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that Team 2 has a higher chance of encountering men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1. Team 1 always selects three men and only considers the middle one for their count, while Team 2 focuses on individual men. Since there are more men below the average height (178 cm) than above 183 cm, it's statistically more likely for Team 2 to find taller men.
