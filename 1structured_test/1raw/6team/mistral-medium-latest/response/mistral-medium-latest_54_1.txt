{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because they are selecting one man at random each day from the entire population, which includes both taller and shorter than average men. On the other hand, Team 1 is selecting three men at random each day and only considering the middle man's height. The probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm, as the middle man height will be closer to the average height of 178 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more such days.
