{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the surveyed man's height was above 183 cm.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Both teams are surveying men from the same population, where the average height is 178 cm.
2. Since there are an equal number of men above and below average height, about half of the population is above 178 cm.
3. Team 1 is surveying three men daily and then finding the middle-ranked man in terms of height.
4. For Team 1 to count a day where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm, not only should the middle man be taller than 183 cm, but the other two men should also have heights such that the middle man remains in the middle position.
5. On the other hand, Team 2 is surveying only one man daily and simply checking if his height is above 183 cm.
6. Because Team 2 only needs to satisfy one condition (the surveyed man's height being above 183 cm), it is more likely that they will count more days compared to Team 1, which has to satisfy multiple conditions for each day.
