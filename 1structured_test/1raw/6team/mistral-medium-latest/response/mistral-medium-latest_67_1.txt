{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with a height greater than 183 cm. This is because they are sampling men individually, whereas Team 1 is sampling in groups of three and only counting the days when the middle man's height is above 183 cm. Even if one or both of the other two men surveyed by Team 1 have a height above 183 cm, it won't be counted if the middle man's height is not. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of counting days with a height greater than 183 cm.
