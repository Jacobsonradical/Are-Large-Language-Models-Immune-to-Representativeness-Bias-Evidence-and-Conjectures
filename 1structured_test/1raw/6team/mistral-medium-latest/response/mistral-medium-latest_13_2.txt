{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days on which the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 is only looking at the height of one individual per day, and that individual is more likely to be taller than the middle man of a group of three. Since there are as many men above the average height (178 cm) as there are below it, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is higher when only one man is being surveyed, compared to the probability of selecting a group of three men and having the middle one be taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days.
