{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man surveyed was over 183 cm than Team 1. This is because Team 1 only counts a day if the middle man out of the three surveyed is over 183 cm, while Team 2 counts any day where the surveyed man is over 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are an equal number of men above and below the average height, it is more likely that a randomly selected man will be below the average height, and therefore less likely that the middle man of a randomly selected group of three men will be over 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the surveyed man was over 183 cm than Team 1.
