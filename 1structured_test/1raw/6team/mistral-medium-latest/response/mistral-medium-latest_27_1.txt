{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 is only looking at one man per day, so they have a higher chance of selecting a tall man on any given day. Team 1, on the other hand, is looking at three men per day and only counting the days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below average height, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is less than 50%. Even if Team 1 does select a tall man, there is no guarantee that he will be the middle man. Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm.
