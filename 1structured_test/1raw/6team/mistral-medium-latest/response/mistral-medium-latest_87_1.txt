{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men whose height is above and below average.
2. Team 1 surveys three men each day and ranks them by height. For the middle man to have a height greater than 183 cm, both the other men must be taller than him.
3. Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man each day, and simply checks if his height is greater than 183 cm.
4. Since 183 cm is significantly higher than the average height (178 cm), it is more likely that Team 2 will encounter more men above that height in their daily surveys compared to Team 1, which requires two out of three men to be taller than 183 cm on each survey day.
5. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Team 2 counted more days on which the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm.
