{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men with heights above and below this average.
2. Team 1 surveys three men each day and records the number of days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
3. Team 2 surveys one man each day and records the number of days when the man's height is more than 183 cm.
4. Since 183 cm is significantly above the average height (178 cm), it is less likely that the middle man in Team 1's surveys will have a height greater than 183 cm. This is because the middle man is more likely to be close to the average height, as the three men are randomly chosen.
5. On the other hand, Team 2 has a better chance of surveying a man whose height is taller than 183 cm, as they only need one man per day to meet this criterion.
6. Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to record more days with a man's height greater than 183 cm than Team 1.
