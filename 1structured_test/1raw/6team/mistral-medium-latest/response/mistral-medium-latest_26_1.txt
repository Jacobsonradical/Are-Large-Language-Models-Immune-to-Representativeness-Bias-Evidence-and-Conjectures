{team: 2}

Explanation:

The question states that the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average. This implies that the distribution of heights in the population is symmetric around the average height.

Team 1 is surveying three men each day and ranking them by height. Therefore, the middle man's height will be greater than 183 cm only if all three men have heights above 183 cm. Since 183 cm is significantly above the average height of 178 cm, it is unlikely that all three men surveyed each day will have heights above 183 cm.

On the other hand, Team 2 is surveying only one man each day, and they only need to count the number of days on which the height of the man surveyed is greater than 183 cm. Since the distribution of heights is symmetric, there are as many men above 183 cm as there are below 178 cm. Therefore, the probability of selecting a man with a height above 183 cm is higher than the probability of selecting three men with heights above 183 cm.

Therefore, it is likely that Team 2 recorded more days on which the height of the man surveyed was greater than 183 cm than Team 1.

Note: The answer assumes that the surveys conducted by both teams are random and unbiased. If there is any bias in the selection of men, the answer may differ.
