{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was over 183 cm. This is because Team 1 only considers the middle man's height, and there is a higher chance that the tallest or shortest man in the group of three would be taller than 183 cm instead of the middle man. In contrast, Team 2 surveys one man each day and considers his height, regardless of whether he is the tallest, shortest, or middle in a hypothetical group. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher overall probability of encountering men taller than 183 cm.
