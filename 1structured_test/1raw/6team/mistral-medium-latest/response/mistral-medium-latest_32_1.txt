{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days on which the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 is only looking at one man per day, and since there are men in the population who are taller than 183 cm, they have a higher chance of randomly selecting one of those men compared to Team 1, who is looking at three men per day and only counting it if the middle man is taller than 183 cm.

In fact, we can calculate the expected number of days that each team would record a height greater than 183 cm. Let's assume that the heights of men in the population are normally distributed with a mean of 178 cm and a standard deviation of 7 cm (which is a reasonable assumption based on real-world data). Then, the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm is about 0.1587 (this can be calculated using a z-score table or a normal distribution calculator).

Therefore, the expected number of days that Team 1 would record a height greater than 183 cm for the middle man is:

(365 days/year) \* (3 men/day) \* (0.1587 probability of height > 183 cm)^2 \* (0.5 probability of being the middle man) ≈ 22.1 days/year

On the other hand, the expected number of days that Team 2 would record a height greater than 183 cm is:

(365 days/year) \* (1 man/day) \* (0.1587 probability of height > 183 cm) ≈ 58.1 days/year

Therefore, we can see that Team 2 is expected to record over twice as many days with heights greater than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
