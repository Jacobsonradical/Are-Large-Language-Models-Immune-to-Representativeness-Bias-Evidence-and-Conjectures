{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 is only looking at one man per day, so they have a higher chance of selecting a taller man compared to Team 1, which is looking at three men per day and only counting the days where the middle man is taller than 183 cm. The fact that half of the men in the population are below average height (178 cm) also supports this reasoning. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Team 2 recorded more such days.
