{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more such days. The reason is that when Team 1 surveys three men each day, they will only count a day if the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. This means that at least one man must be taller than 183 cm and at least one man must be shorter. On the other hand, Team 2 only needs to find one man taller than 183 cm each day to count it. Since there are as many men above the average height (178 cm) as there are below it, and the threshold for counting a day is significantly higher (183 cm), it is more likely that Team 2 will record more days where the man's height is taller than 183 cm.
