{team: 2}

Explanation:

Team 1 is sampling 3 men every day and only counting the days where the middle man's height is above 183 cm. Since the middle man is taller than one man and shorter than another man on the same day, it is less likely that the middle man will have a height greater than 183 cm compared to a randomly selected man from the population.

Team 2, on the other hand, is sampling only one man every day and counting the days where that man's height is above 183 cm. Since men taller than 183 cm are a subset of the population, it is more likely that Team 2 will count more such days compared to Team 1.

Therefore, I think Team 2 recorded more days with a height greater than 183 cm.
