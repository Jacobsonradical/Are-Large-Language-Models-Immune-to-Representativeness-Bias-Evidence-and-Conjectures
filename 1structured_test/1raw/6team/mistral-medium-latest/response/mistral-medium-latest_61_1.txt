{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was over 183 cm. This is because Team 1 is surveying three men each day and only counting days where the middle man's height is over 183 cm. This means that Team 1 is potentially excluding two men each day who may have had heights over 183 cm, simply because they were not the middle man. In contrast, Team 2 is counting every day where the man surveyed had a height over 183 cm, regardless of his ranking among other men surveyed that day. Therefore, it is likely that Team 2 recorded more such days than Team 1.
