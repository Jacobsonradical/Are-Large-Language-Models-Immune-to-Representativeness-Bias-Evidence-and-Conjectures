{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Team 1 is surveying 3 men each day and only counting days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the middle man is taller than the shortest man but not necessarily taller than the tallest man, there's a chance that the middle man's height may still be less than or equal to 183 cm.
2. Team 2, on the other hand, is surveying only one man each day and counting days when that man's height is more than 183 cm.
3. Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and half of the men have a height above average, we can infer that the distribution of heights is likely bell-shaped (normal distribution). Therefore, there will be fewer men with heights above 183 cm compared to those below or around the average height.
4. Given this, it's more likely that Team 2 will record more days with heights above 183 cm than Team 1, as Team 1 has an additional condition (the man must be the middle one out of three surveyed individuals) for counting a day.

Hence, I believe Team 2 counted more such days.
