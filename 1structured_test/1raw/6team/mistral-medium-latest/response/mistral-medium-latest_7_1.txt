{team: 2}

The reasoning behind this is that Team 2 has a higher chance of encountering a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1. Team 1 selects three men each day and only counts it if the middle man is taller than 183 cm, which reduces their chances compared to Team 2 selecting just one man per day. The majority of the time, the middle man in Team 1's surveys will likely be around the average height (178 cm) or close to it, making it less likely for them to record a day with a middle man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2.
