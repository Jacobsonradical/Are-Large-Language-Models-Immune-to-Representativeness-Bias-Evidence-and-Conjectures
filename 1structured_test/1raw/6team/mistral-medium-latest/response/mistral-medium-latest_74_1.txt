{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because when Team 1 surveys three men each day, they are ranking them by height. Therefore, the middle man's height will only be more than 183 cm on days when all three men surveyed have heights above 183 cm. On the other hand, Team 2 is only surveying one man each day, so they have a higher chance of randomly selecting a man who is taller than 183 cm.

To quantify this, let's assume that the distribution of heights in the population is normal and that the standard deviation is about 7 cm (based on typical human height variations). Using this assumption, we can calculate that the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.1%. Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 would expect to survey a man taller than 183 cm on approximately 0.365 days, on average.

On the other hand, the probability that all three men surveyed by Team 1 are taller than 183 cm is (0.001)^3, or approximately 0.000001. Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 1 would expect to survey three men all taller than 183 cm on approximately 0.00003 days, on average. This is much lower than the expected number of days for Team 2.

Therefore, it is highly likely that Team 2 counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm.
