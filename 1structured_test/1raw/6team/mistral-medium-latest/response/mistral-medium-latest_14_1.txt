{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was above 183 cm. This is because they are only looking at one person's height each day, and that person has a higher chance of being taller than 183 cm if they are selected from the half of the population that is above average height (178 cm). On the other hand, Team 1 is looking at three people's heights each day, and even if they are all above average, it is still less likely that the middle person's height will be above 183 cm compared to Team 2's single daily selection. Therefore, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was above 183 cm.
