{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with heights above 183 cm compared to Team 1. This is because Team 2 is surveying individuals from the entire population, while Team 1 is only looking at the middle man from their sample of three men each day. Since half of the men in the population have a height above the average of 178 cm, and the height threshold for both teams is 183 cm, it is expected that Team 2 will have a higher count of days with heights above the threshold due to their larger sample size.

The following reasoning supports this answer:

1. Team 1 surveys three men each day and only considers the middle man in their ranking. If we assume a normal distribution of heights in the population, the probability of the middle man having a height above 183 cm is less than 50%, as 183 cm is above the average height of 178 cm.
2. Team 2 surveys one man each day, and their sample size is therefore three times larger than that of Team 1 over the course of a year (3 men/day x 365 days = 1,095 men vs. 1 man/day x 365 days = 365 men). This larger sample size increases the chances of encountering men with heights above the 183 cm threshold.
3. Although the exact number of days each team records heights above 183 cm depends on the specific height distribution in the population, it is reasonable to expect that Team 2 will record more such days due to their larger sample size and the higher probability of encountering tall men.

In conclusion, Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with heights above 183 cm, so the answer is: {team: 2}
