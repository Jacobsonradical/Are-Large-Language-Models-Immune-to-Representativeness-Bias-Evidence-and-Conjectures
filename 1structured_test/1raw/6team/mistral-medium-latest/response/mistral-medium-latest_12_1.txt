{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1 only considers the middle man's height in a group of three, while Team 2 considers the height of every man surveyed. Since the height of the middle man in Team 1's surveys is, by definition, more likely to be closer to the average height (178 cm) than the heights of the men surveyed by Team 2, Team 1 will have fewer instances of recording a height above 183 cm.
