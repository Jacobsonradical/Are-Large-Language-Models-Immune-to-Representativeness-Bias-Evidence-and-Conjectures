{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days of surveying men taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 surveys one man per day, and they only need to find one man above the threshold of 183 cm to count that day. In contrast, Team 1 surveys three men per day and only counts the day if the middle-ranked man is taller than 183 cm. Since the middle-ranked man needs to be taller than the other two men on that day, it's less likely that Team 1 will count a day compared to Team 2.
