{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 2 is only looking at one man per day, and the probability of that one man being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of the middle man in Team 1's sample of three men being taller than 183 cm.

The reason for this is that Team 1's middle man could be either the tallest, shortest, or middle height among the three men surveyed. On the other hand, Team 2's single man has a higher chance of being taller than 183 cm since he is not being compared to anyone else.

Assuming that the height distribution in the population is symmetric and follows a normal distribution, we can calculate the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm. Based on the information provided, the average height is 178 cm with a standard deviation that can be estimated as 7 cm (since half of the men are taller and half are shorter than the average height). Using a z-score calculation, the probability of a man being taller than 183 cm is approximately 0.023 (or 2.3%).

For Team 1, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is lower than this value. This is because the middle man's height needs to be higher than at least one other man in the sample of three. The exact probability would require more complex calculations, but it is clear that it would be less than 2.3%.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Team 2 is likely to have counted more days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.
