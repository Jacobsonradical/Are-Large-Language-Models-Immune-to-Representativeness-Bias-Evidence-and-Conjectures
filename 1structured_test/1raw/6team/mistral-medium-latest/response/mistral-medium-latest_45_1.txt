{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. Team 1 is selecting three men every day and looking at the middle one's height. Since the average height is 178 cm and half the men are taller than this, we can assume that the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is less than 0.5 (otherwise, the average height would be higher).

2. Therefore, the probability of selecting three men and having the middle one be taller than 183 cm is even lower than the probability of selecting one man and having him be taller than 183 cm.

3. Team 2 is simply selecting one man every day and checking if his height is more than 183 cm. As mentioned earlier, this probability is less than 0.5, but it's still higher than the probability of Team 1's scenario.

4. Over a large number of days (365), the Law of Large Numbers states that the actual proportions should approach the theoretical probabilities. Therefore, Team 2 should record more days with a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1.
