{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1 is only looking at the middle man out of three randomly selected men each day, while Team 2 is looking at the height of just one randomly selected man each day. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above that height as below it, the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is less than 50%. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of selecting a taller man on any given day than Team 1 does of selecting a middle man who is taller than 183 cm.
