{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have recorded more days on which the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because they are only looking at one man per day, and the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of selecting a man who is both taller than the other two men surveyed by Team 1 and taller than 183 cm. The fact that there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average does not affect this conclusion, as the height threshold of 183 cm is above the average height of 178 cm.
