{team: 2}

Explanation:

The question states that the average height of men in the population is around 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men whose height is above and below average. This implies that the distribution of heights is symmetric around the average.

Assuming that the height distribution is roughly bell-shaped and that 183 cm is more than one standard deviation above the mean (which is consistent with the fact that it's taller than the average height), we can estimate the proportion of men who are taller than 183 cm to be about 16% (based on the properties of the normal distribution).

Now, let's consider the two teams' sampling methods:

* Team 1 randomly selects three men each day and ranks them by height. The middle man's height will be higher than 183 cm only if all three men are taller than 183 cm. Since the probability of a randomly selected man being taller than 183 cm is 16%, the probability of all three men being taller than 183 cm is (0.16)^3 ≈ 0.00043, or about 0.043%. Over the course of a year (365 days), we would expect Team 1 to count approximately 0.043 \* 365 ≈ 16 days on which the middle man's height is more than 183 cm.
* Team 2 randomly selects one man each day. The probability of this man being taller than 183 cm is 16%, so over the course of a year (365 days), we would expect Team 2 to count approximately 0.16 \* 365 ≈ 58.4 days on which the man's height is more than 183 cm.

Therefore, we can expect Team 2 to count significantly more days on which the man's height is more than 183 cm than Team 1, so the answer is {team: 2}.
