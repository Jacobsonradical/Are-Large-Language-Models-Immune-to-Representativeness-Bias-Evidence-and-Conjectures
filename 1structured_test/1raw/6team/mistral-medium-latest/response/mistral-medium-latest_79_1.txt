{team: 2}

Here's why:

The average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below this height. The height threshold of 183 cm is significantly higher than the average height.

Team 1 surveys 3 men each day and looks for the middle man's height. Even if one of the men has a height greater than 183 cm, it doesn't necessarily mean that the middle man's height will also be greater than 183 cm. There's a good chance that the other two men's heights are taller or shorter, causing the middle man's height to be below or equal to 183 cm.

On the other hand, Team 2 directly surveys one man each day and checks if his height is greater than 183 cm. Since the sample size is smaller and they don't have to worry about the middle man's height, they have a higher chance of encountering a man with a height greater than 183 cm compared to Team 1.

Therefore, it's more likely that Team 2 recorded more days with a man's height greater than 183 cm.
