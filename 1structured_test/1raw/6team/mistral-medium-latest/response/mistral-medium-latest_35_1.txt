{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with heights over 183 cm. Here's why:

1. Team 1 surveys three men every day and only counts the day if the middle man's height is over 183 cm.
2. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are as many men above average as there are below, it follows that the median height should also be around 178 cm (assuming a symmetric distribution).
3. This means that on most days, the middle man's height will be close to the median, which is less than 183 cm.
4. Team 2, on the other hand, surveys just one man per day and counts the day if that man's height is over 183 cm.
5. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of encountering a tall man and counting the day compared to Team 1, which requires the middle man to be taller than 183 cm.

Note: This answer assumes a symmetric distribution of heights in the population. If the distribution is skewed, the outcome might change. However, with the given information, it seems reasonable to assume symmetry.
