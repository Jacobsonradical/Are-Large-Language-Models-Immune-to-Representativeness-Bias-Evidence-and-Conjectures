{team: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that Team 2 has a higher chance of selecting a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1. This is because Team 1 is always choosing three men and looking for the middle one to be taller than 183 cm, which reduces their chances as they have an additional constraint. Team 2, on the other hand, only needs to find one man per day who is taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to record more such days.
