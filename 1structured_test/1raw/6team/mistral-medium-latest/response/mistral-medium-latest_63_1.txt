{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a height greater than 183 cm. This is because they are sampling only one man each day, and the probability of that man being taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of the middle man in Team 1's sample being taller than 183 cm. Team 1's sample size is three men, and they only count it if the middle man is taller than 183 cm, which reduces their chances compared to Team 2.
