{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1 only considers the middle man among the three surveyed each day, and there is a higher chance that the tallest man among the three is surveyed by Team 2. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher probability of encountering men taller than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
