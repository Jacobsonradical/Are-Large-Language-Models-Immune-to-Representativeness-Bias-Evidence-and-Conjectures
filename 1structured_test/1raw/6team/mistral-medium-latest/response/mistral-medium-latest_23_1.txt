{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm, as they are only looking at one man per day, so any man taller than 183 cm will count towards their total. In contrast, Team 1 is looking at groups of three men and only counting days where the middle man in height is taller than 183 cm. This means that even if one or two of the men in the group are taller than 183 cm, it won't count towards their total unless the middle man is also taller than 183 cm. Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and half of the men are below average height, it's likely that the majority of the middle men in the groups surveyed by Team 1 will also be below average height and therefore less likely to be taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm.
