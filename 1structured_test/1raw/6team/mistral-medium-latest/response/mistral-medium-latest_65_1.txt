{team: 2}

Explanation:

Team 1 surveys three men each day and only counts the day if the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the middle man is taller than one man and shorter than another man, it is less likely that his height will exceed 183 cm compared to a randomly selected man. Therefore, Team 1 is expected to count fewer days than Team 2.

Team 2, on the other hand, surveys only one man each day and counts the day if the man's height is more than 183 cm. Since men taller than 183 cm exist in the population, Team 2 is expected to count more days than Team 1.

Therefore, the answer is {team: 2}.
