{team: 2}

The reasoning behind this is that Team 2 has a higher chance of encountering a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1. Team 1 selects three men each day and only counts it if the middle man is taller than 183 cm, which means they might miss instances where the tallest man is above 183 cm but is not selected as the middle man. Team 2, on the other hand, counts every day they find a man taller than 183 cm, regardless of any other factors. Since the population has a normal distribution around an average height of 178 cm, it is likely that Team 2 will encounter more men taller than 183 cm than Team 1 will find as the middle man in their groups of three.
