{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days where the height of the man surveyed was over 183 cm. This is because they are only surveying one person per day, so they only need to find one individual who is taller than 183 cm to count that day. On the other hand, Team 1 has to find three individuals per day and the middle one must be taller than 183 cm in order to count that day. Since there are as many men above the average height (178 cm) as below it, the probability of finding a man taller than 183 cm is less than 50%. Therefore, the probability of finding three such men in a row with the middle one being taller than 183 cm is even lower, making it less likely for Team 1 to record as many days as Team 2.
