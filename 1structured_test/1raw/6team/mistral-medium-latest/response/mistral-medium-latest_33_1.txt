{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. Since Team 1 is always selecting three men and taking the middle one, they are less likely to choose a man taller than 183 cm compared to Team 2, who selects only one man each day. This is because the middle man in Team 1's selection will only be taller than 183 cm if both the other men are also taller than 183 cm. On the other hand, Team 2 only needs to select one man taller than 183 cm to count that day.
