{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days because they are surveying men every day, while Team 1 is only considering the middle man's height in their count. Even though Team 1 is surveying three men each day, the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is lower than the probability of any one of the men being taller than 183 cm, which is what Team 2 is looking for. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days with men taller than 183 cm, assuming that the height distribution in the population is approximately normal.
