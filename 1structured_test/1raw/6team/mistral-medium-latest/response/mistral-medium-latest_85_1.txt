{team: 2}

Here's my reasoning:

1. Team 1 surveys 3 men per day, so they surveyed a total of 3 * 365 = 1095 men over the course of a year.
2. For a man to be considered the "middle" height among the 3 surveyed, there must be at least one man taller and one man shorter than him.
3. The average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men above and below this average.
4. Therefore, it is less likely for Team 1 to find a middle man with a height greater than 183 cm, as that would require both the other men surveyed on that day to be even taller.
5. On the other hand, Team 2 surveys only one man per day, so their chances of finding a man taller than 183 cm are not influenced by other men surveyed on the same day.
6. Since both teams are surveying men from the same population, and Team 2 has no additional constraints like finding a middle man, it is more likely that Team 2 will count more days with men taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, I think Team 2 counted more such days.
