{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with heights above 183 cm. Here's the reasoning:

1. Since the average height is 178 cm and there are equal numbers of men above and below this height, the middle man in Team 1's sample will not frequently be taller than 183 cm (which is significantly above the average).
2. Team 2, however, has a higher chance of selecting a man taller than 183 cm each day, as they are not limited to just the tallest man among three.
3. Therefore, Team 2 will probably have a higher count of days with heights above 183 cm than Team 1.
