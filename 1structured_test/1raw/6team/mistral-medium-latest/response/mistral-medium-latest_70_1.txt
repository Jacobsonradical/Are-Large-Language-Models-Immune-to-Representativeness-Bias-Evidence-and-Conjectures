{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was over 183 cm. This is because they survey one man per day, and if his height is over 183 cm, it counts towards their total. On the other hand, Team 1 surveys three men per day and only counts it if the middle man's height is over 183 cm. Since the average height is 178 cm, and there are as many men above the average height as there are below it, there will generally be fewer men who are over 183 cm tall. Therefore, it is more likely that Team 2 will have counted more such days than Team 1.

Note that this is a statistical argument, and the actual results could vary depending on the specific men surveyed by each team. However, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with men over 183 cm tall.
