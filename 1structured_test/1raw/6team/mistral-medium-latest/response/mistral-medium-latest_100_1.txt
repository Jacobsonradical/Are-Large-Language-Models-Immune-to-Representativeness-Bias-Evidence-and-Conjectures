{team: 2}

Here's my reasoning:

1. Team 1 surveys 3 men per day, while Team 2 surveys only 1 man per day.
2. However, Team 1 is only counting days when the middle man (i.e., the man whose height is between the other two men) is taller than 183 cm. This means that Team 1 is not counting days when the tallest man is surveyed but is shorter than 183 cm, and the two shorter men are surveyed as well.
3. On the other hand, Team 2 is simply counting days when any man surveyed is taller than 183 cm. This includes days when the tallest man in the population is surveyed.
4. Given that the average height in the population is 178 cm, it is likely that fewer than 50% of men are taller than 183 cm. Therefore, it is more probable that Team 2 will count more days with men taller than 183 cm than Team 1, who only counts days when the middle man is taller than 183 cm.
5. Additionally, the fact that Team 1's count is based on the middle man's height means that their count is dependent on the heights of the other two men surveyed on that day. This introduces more variability and uncertainty in Team 1's count, which further suggests that Team 2 is likely to have a higher count.

Therefore, I believe that Team 2 counted more days with men taller than 183 cm.
