{team: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that Team 2 has a higher chance of recording a day where the height of the man surveyed is more than 183 cm compared to Team 1. This is because Team 1 only considers the middle man's height, and there is a chance that none or only one of the three men surveyed is taller than 183 cm, while Team 2 surveys only one man and counts every instance where his height is more than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to record more such days than Team 1.
