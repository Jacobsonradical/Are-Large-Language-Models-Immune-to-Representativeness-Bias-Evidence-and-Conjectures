{team: 2}

Explanation:

Team 1 is selecting three men every day and only counting the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the middle man is taller than one of the other two men, it means that at least 1/3 of the men selected by Team 1 each day are taller than 183 cm. However, this does not guarantee that the middle man himself is taller than 183 cm.

On the other hand, Team 2 is selecting only one man every day and counting the days when that man's height is more than 183 cm. This means that every time they select a man taller than 183 cm, they count it.

Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm and there are as many men whose height is above average as there are men whose height is below average, it implies that the distribution of heights is symmetric around the average. Therefore, we can assume that the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is the same for both teams.

However, Team 2 has a higher chance of counting a day since they only need to select one man who is taller than 183 cm, whereas Team 1 needs to select three men and hope that the middle one is taller than 183 cm. Hence, Team 2 is likely to count more such days than Team 1.
