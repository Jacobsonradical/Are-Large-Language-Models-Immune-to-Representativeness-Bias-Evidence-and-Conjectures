{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days than Team 1.

Here's why:

Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are as many men above the average height as there are below it, we can infer that about 50% of the men in the population are taller than 178 cm.

In order for the middle man in Team 1's sample of three to be taller than 183 cm, both of the other men in the sample would also need to be taller than 183 cm. Therefore, the probability of this happening is much lower than the probability of a single man being taller than 183 cm.

Assuming that the heights of the men in the population are normally distributed, we can estimate that the proportion of men in the population who are taller than 183 cm is about 16%. This means that on any given day, the probability of Team 2 selecting a man who is taller than 183 cm is 16%.

On the other hand, the probability of all three men in Team 1's sample being taller than 183 cm is (0.16)^3, which is approximately 0.0043 or 0.43%. This means that the probability of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is even lower than this.

Therefore, it is very likely that Team 2 will count more days on which the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm than Team 1 will count days on which the middle man in their sample was taller than 183 cm.
