{team: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that Team 1 selects three men each day and only counts the day if the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. However, Team 2 selects only one man each day and counts the day whenever the selected man's height is more than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of recording a day as a "success" compared to Team 1.

Additionally, the problem states that the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and since there are an equal number of men above and below the average height, it implies that there are more men with a height less than 183 cm compared to those taller than 183 cm. This further supports the conclusion that Team 2 would have a higher count of successful days.

Therefore, I believe Team 2 counted more such days than Team 1.
