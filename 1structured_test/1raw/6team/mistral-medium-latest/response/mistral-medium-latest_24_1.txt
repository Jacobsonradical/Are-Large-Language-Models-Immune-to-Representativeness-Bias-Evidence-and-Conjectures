To answer this question, we need to consider the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm for each team and how this affects the total count over 365 days.

For Team 1, they survey three men each day. Since half of the men in the population are above average height (178 cm), and the middle man's height is more than 183 cm only if the two other men are also taller than 183 cm, the probability of this occurring is the probability of selecting three men all taller than 183 cm. Assuming the selection is random and independent, this would be (probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm)^3.

For Team 2, they survey only one man each day, so the probability of counting a day where the man is taller than 183 cm is simply the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm.

Since (probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm)^3 is less than the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm, it follows that Team 2 will count more such days than Team 1 over the course of 365 days.

Therefore, the answer is:
{team: 2}
