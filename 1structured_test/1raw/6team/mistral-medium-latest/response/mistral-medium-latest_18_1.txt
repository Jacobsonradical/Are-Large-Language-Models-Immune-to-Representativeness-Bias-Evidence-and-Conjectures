{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1 only considers the middle man's height, and there is a chance that none or only one of the three men surveyed each day will be taller than 183 cm. On the other hand, Team 2 surveys one man each day and counts every instance where the man's height is above 183 cm, increasing their chances of recording more days with men taller than 183 cm.
