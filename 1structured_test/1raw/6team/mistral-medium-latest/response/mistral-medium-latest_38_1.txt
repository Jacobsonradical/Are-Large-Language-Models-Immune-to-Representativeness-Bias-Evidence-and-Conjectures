{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Team 1 is randomly selecting 3 men each day and only counting the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the men are selected randomly, it is less likely that the middle man will always be taller than 183 cm.
2. Team 2, on the other hand, is selecting only 1 man each day and counting the days when that man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, it is more likely that Team 2 will encounter men who are taller than 183 cm.
3. Therefore, over the course of 365 days, Team 2 is likely to count more days when the man's height is more than 183 cm compared to Team 1.
