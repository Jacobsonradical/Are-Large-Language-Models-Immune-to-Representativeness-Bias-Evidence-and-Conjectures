{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because they are surveying one man at a time, while Team 1 is surveying three men at a time and only counting the days where the middle man's height is above 183 cm. Since half of the men in the population are above average height (178 cm), and the average height is less than 183 cm, it is likely that a smaller proportion of men have a height above 183 cm. Therefore, Team 1's requirement of the middle man being taller than 183 cm is a more stringent condition than Team 2's requirement of just one man being taller than 183 cm, which would result in fewer days being counted for Team 1.
