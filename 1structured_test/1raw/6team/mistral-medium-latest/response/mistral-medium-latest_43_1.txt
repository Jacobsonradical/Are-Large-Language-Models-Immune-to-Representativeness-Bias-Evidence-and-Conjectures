{team: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Team 1 is surveying three men every day and only counts the day if the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the middle man's height is above average (178 cm) and the height threshold (183 cm) is quite high, it is less likely that the middle man's height will exceed 183 cm on most days.
2. Team 2, on the other hand, is only surveying one man every day and counts the day if that man's height is more than 183 cm. While this is still a relatively rare occurrence, it is more likely to happen than the specific scenario of the middle man being taller than 183 cm in Team 1's case.
3. Therefore, I think Team 2 counted more such days than Team 1.
