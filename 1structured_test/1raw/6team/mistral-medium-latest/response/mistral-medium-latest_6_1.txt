{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was taller than 183 cm. This is because Team 1 only considers the middle man's height, and there are only three men in their sample each day. On the other hand, Team 2 considers the height of every man they survey, and they survey one man each day for 365 days. Since the average height is 178 cm and half of the men are above average, it is expected that Team 2 will have a higher chance of encountering a man taller than 183 cm than Team 1.
