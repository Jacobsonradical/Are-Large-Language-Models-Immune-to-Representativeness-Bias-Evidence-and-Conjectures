{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days because they are surveying one man each day and only need that one man's height to be above 183 cm to count as a success. In contrast, Team 1 is surveying three men each day and only counts a success if the middle man's height is above 183 cm, which is less likely to happen than a single man's height being above that threshold. Therefore, Team 2 is likely to have counted more days with heights above 183 cm.
