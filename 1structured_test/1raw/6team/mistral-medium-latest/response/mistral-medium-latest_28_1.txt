{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days with a height greater than 183 cm. This is because they are sampling one man each day, and the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm is higher than the probability of selecting a group of three men where the middle man's height is greater than 183 cm. In the case of Team 1, even if one or two men are taller than 183 cm, it does not necessarily mean that the middle man's height will also be above that threshold. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of counting more such days.
