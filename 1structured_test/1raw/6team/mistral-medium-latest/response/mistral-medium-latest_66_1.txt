{team: 2}

Explanation:

Team 1 is surveying sets of 3 men every day, and they are only counting the days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. Since the middle man's height is above average (178 cm) but not necessarily above 183 cm, there will be fewer days when the middle man's height is more than 183 cm compared to the total number of days when any man's height is more than 183 cm.

Team 2, on the other hand, is simply counting the total number of days when the height of the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm. Since they are surveying one man every day, their chances of encountering a man taller than 183 cm are higher compared to Team 1's chances of encountering a middle man taller than 183 cm in their sets of 3 men.

Therefore, it is likely that Team 2 counted more such days compared to Team 1.
