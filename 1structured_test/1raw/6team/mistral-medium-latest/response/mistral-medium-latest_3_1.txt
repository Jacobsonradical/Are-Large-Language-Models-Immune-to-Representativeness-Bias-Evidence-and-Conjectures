{team: 2}

Team 2 is more likely to have counted more days where the height of the man surveyed was over 183 cm. This is because they are only surveying one man at a time, and that man either meets or does not meet the height requirement. In contrast, Team 1 is surveying three men at a time and only counting the days where the middle man's height is over 183 cm. This means that even if all three men have heights over 183 cm, the team would not count that day if the middle man is not the tallest of the three. Since half of the men in the population are below average height (178 cm), it is less likely that Team 1 will observe a middle man with a height over 183 cm compared to Team 2 observing any man with a height over 183 cm.
