{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have recorded more days on which the height of the man they surveyed was taller than 183 cm.

Here's why:

When Team 1 surveys three men and ranks them by height, it is less likely for the middle man to be taller than 183 cm, as the middle man is simply the man who is not the tallest or the shortest among the three. There is a higher chance that the tallest man in the group will be taller than 183 cm, but since Team 1 is only counting the middle man, they may miss some instances where the tallest man is taller than 183 cm.

On the other hand, Team 2 is surveying only one man each day, and they are simply counting the number of days on which the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm. Since they are not limiting themselves to the middle man, they have a higher chance of recording a day where the man they surveyed is taller than 183 cm.

Therefore, it is likely that Team 2 counted more such days than Team 1.
