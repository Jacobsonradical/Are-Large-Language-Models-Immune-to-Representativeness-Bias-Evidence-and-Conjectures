{team: 2}

Team 2 is likely to have counted more such days than Team 1. This is because Team 1 only considers the middle man in their samples of three, whereas Team 2 considers every man they sample. Even though the middle man in Team 1's samples is taller than at least one other man in the group, he may not necessarily be taller than 183 cm. Therefore, Team 2 has a higher chance of encountering men taller than 183 cm in their samples, leading to a higher count of such days.
