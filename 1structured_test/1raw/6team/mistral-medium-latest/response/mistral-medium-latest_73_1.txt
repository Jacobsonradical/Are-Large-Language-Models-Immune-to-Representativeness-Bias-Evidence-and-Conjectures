{team: 2}

Explanation:

Since the average height of men in the population is 178 cm, and there are equal numbers of men taller and shorter than this, we can infer that the distribution is symmetrical around 178 cm. Given that 183 cm is significantly above the average height, it is less likely that a randomly selected individual will have a height greater than 183 cm.

Team 1 surveys three men daily and looks for instances where the middle man's height is more than 183 cm. However, even if one man has a height greater than 183 cm, it is not guaranteed that he will be the middle one. Only when the two other men are shorter than 183 cm and the middle man is taller will the condition be met. This means Team 1's count will be lower than the number of days that they select at least one man taller than 183 cm.

On the other hand, Team 2 surveys only one man daily and counts the days when his height is more than 183 cm. Their count will be directly related to the probability of selecting a man taller than 183 cm, without any additional constraints.

Therefore, Team 2 is expected to count more such days than Team 1.
