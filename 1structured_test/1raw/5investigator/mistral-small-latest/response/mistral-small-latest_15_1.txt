In this scenario, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. The reason is that the first line of a page might contain longer words or more long words compared to the rest of the page, especially if it's a sentence or a heading. Therefore, the average word-length of the first line could be higher than the average word-length of the entire page.

So, the answer is:
{investigator: 2}
