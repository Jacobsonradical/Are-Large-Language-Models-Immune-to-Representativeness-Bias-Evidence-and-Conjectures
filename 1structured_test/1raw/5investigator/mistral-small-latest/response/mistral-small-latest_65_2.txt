Given the information, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's why:

- The average word-length in the entire book is 4. However, the first line of each page might have longer words for emphasis or to introduce new topics, which could lead to a higher average word-length.
- Investigator 2 focused on the first line of each page, which might contain more complex sentences and longer words compared to the rest of the page, leading to a higher average word-length in these lines.
- On the other hand, Investigator 1 calculated the average word-length for entire pages, which might include shorter words and simpler sentences spread throughout the page, balancing out the word-length average.

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

So, the answer is: {investigator: 2}
