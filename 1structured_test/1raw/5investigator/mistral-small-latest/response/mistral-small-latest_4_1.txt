To determine which investigator recorded a larger number of units (pages versus lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the distribution of word-lengths within the book.

Given that the average word-length in the entire book is 4, this means that the total sum of the word-lengths divided by the total number of words results in 4. However, this average can be skewed by a few very long words or many short words.

Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length per page. If the book has a consistent distribution of word-lengths across all pages, the number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more would likely be lower because the variability is spread out over many words per page.

Investigator 2 is looking at the average word-length in the first line of each page. The first line might contain shorter or longer words, potentially causing more variability. If there are pages with particularly long words in the first line, these lines could easily exceed the 6-word average threshold, leading to a higher count of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Therefore, it is likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units because the first line of each page can have higher variability in word-lengths compared to the entire page's average.

Based on this reasoning, the answer is:

{investigator: 2}
