Without specific data on the distribution of word lengths within pages and lines, it's challenging to definitively determine which investigator would record a larger number. However, based on general statistical principles, it can be hypothesized that the line-level average word lengths might exhibit more variability compared to the page-level average word lengths. This is because a single line with a small number of words can be more easily influenced by outlier word lengths, potentially leading to a higher average word length in that line. In contrast, the average word length on a page is calculated over a larger sample size of words, which might smooth out the variability.

Given these considerations, it's plausible that Investigator 2 might record a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more. Therefore, my hypothesis would be:

{investigator: 2}
