Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's why:

1. The average word-length for the entire book is 4, which means that most pages and lines will have an average word-length below 6.
2. However, the first line of a page is more likely to contain longer words, as it often starts with a sentence that sets the context or introduces a new topic. This could lead to a higher average word-length for the first line compared to the rest of the page.
3. Therefore, Investigator 2, who looked at the first line of each page, might find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 1, who looked at the entire page.

So, my answer is: {investigator: 2}
