{investigator: 2}

Explanation:

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page might contain longer words or more complex sentences, which can lead to a higher average word-length compared to the entire page. Longer words are often used at the beginning of a text to establish context or to capture the reader's attention. Therefore, it's more likely that the first line of each page has a higher average word-length than the average word-length of the entire page.
