Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's why:

- The average word-length in the entire book is 4, which means most words are relatively short.
- The first line of a page might start with a longer word or phrase, which could skew the average word-length of that line upwards.
- Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which could potentially have longer words due to sentence structure or the placement of headings, titles, or quotations.
- Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, so while some pages might have an average word-length of 6 or more, it's likely that not every page will due to the overall average being 4.

Therefore, I predict that Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
