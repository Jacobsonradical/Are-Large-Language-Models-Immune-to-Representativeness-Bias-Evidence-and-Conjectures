Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page might contain longer words or more complex sentence structures that could inflate the average word-length, while the rest of the page might have shorter words or simpler structures that bring the page's overall average word-length down. Therefore, the first line's average word-length could be more likely to exceed 6 than the page's average word-length.

So, the answer is:
{investigator: 2}
