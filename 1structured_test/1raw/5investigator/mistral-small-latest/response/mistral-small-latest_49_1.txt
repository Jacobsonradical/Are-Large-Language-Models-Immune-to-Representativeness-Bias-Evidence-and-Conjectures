Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- The overall average word-length in the book is 4, which means many pages and lines will have an average below 6.
- However, the first line of a page might contain longer words compared to the rest of the page (e.g., it could be a title, a heading, or a complex sentence).
- Therefore, Investigator 2 might have a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to the pages counted by Investigator 1.

So, I would answer: {investigator: 2}
