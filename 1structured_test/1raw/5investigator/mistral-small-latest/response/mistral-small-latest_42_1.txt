{investigator: 2}

Explanation: Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of each page may contain longer words that are used for emphasis or to introduce the topic of the page, leading to a higher average word-length in those lines compared to the entire page.
