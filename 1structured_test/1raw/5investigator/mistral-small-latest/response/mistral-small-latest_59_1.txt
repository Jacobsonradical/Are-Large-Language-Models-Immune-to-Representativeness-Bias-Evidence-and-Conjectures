Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- The average word-length in the entire book is 4, which means that most words are shorter than 6 letters.
- A single long word can significantly increase the average word-length of a line, as lines typically contain fewer words than pages.
- Therefore, it's more likely for a line to have an average word-length of 6 or more due to the presence of a few long words, compared to an entire page.

So, my answer is: {investigator: 2}
