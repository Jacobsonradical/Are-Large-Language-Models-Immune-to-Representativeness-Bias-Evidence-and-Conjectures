{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more because the first line of each page may contain longer words or more complex sentences, which can increase the average word-length. In contrast, Investigator 1 is calculating the average word-length for entire pages, which could include shorter words and simpler sentences that balance out the longer words, resulting in a lower average word-length for some pages. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to have a higher count of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
