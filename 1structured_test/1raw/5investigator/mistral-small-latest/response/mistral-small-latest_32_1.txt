Based on the information provided, it's difficult to determine which investigator recorded a larger number without additional data about the book's structure and text distribution. However, if we assume a relatively consistent distribution of word lengths throughout the text, it's possible that the number of pages and lines with an average word length of 6 or more could be similar. Therefore, I would lean towards:

{investigator: 3}
