{investigator_1: your answer}

To determine which investigator recorded a larger number of units (pages for Investigator 1 and lines for Investigator 2) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the distribution of word lengths within the book.

Given that the overall average word-length in the entire book is 4, we can infer that words are typically around this length. However, there can be variability across different pages and lines.

Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which means the average word-length on a page could be influenced by a few very long words or many shorter words. If the book contains pages with dense text or very long words, it is possible that some pages will have a significantly higher average word-length.

Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page. The first line might not always be representative of the entire page, but it could still capture variations in word-length. If the first lines tend to have a mix of short and long words, the average word-length might fluctuate less compared to entire pages.

Without specific data on the distribution of word lengths within the book, it is challenging to definitively say which investigator would record a larger number. However, considering the variability that can exist within text, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Investigator 1, who is looking at entire pages, might record more pages with an average word-length of 6 or more, especially if the book contains pages with particularly long words or dense text.

Therefore, based on the given information and assumptions, I would lean towards:
