{investigator 2: 2}

Explanation: Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of such units because the first line of any page can vary significantly in length and content compared to the rest of the page. It's possible for the first line to have longer words, while the rest of the page has shorter words, leading to a higher average word-length in the first line. Therefore, Investigator 2 might find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who is looking at entire pages.
