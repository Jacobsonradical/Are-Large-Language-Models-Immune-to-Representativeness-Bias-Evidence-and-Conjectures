Based on the provided information, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's why:

- Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which contain more words than a single line. The average word-length for a page is likely to be closer to the book's overall average (4) than the average word-length of a single line. This is because pages have more words to balance out longer and shorter words.
- Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page. Lines can have a wider range of average word-lengths because they contain fewer words, making them more susceptible to the influence of a few long or short words.

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 2 will find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, as these lines can have a higher variability in word-length.

So, the answer is: {investigator: 2}
