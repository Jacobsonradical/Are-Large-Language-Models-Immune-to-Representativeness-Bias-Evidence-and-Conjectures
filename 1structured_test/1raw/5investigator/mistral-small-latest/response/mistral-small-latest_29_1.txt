{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page can often contain longer words, such as the title or a heading, which can significantly increase the average word-length of that specific line. In contrast, the average word-length across an entire page is likely to be more evenly distributed, with fewer pages reaching an average word-length of 6 or more. Therefore, Investigator 2's count is expected to be higher.
