{investigator: 1}

Explanation: Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length across entire pages, which likely includes more words per unit of analysis (a page) compared to Investigator 2, who is looking at the average word-length of just the first line of each page. Since the first line of a page might not be representative of the entire page's word-length distribution, it is more likely that Investigator 1 will find more pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
