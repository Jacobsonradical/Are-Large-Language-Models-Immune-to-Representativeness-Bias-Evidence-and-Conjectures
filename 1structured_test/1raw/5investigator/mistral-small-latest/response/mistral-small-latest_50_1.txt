To determine which investigator recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the distribution of word lengths throughout the book. Given that the overall average word-length in the entire book is 4, we can infer that there is variability in word lengths across different pages and lines.

Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length per page, while Investigator 2 is focusing on the average word-length of the first line on each page.

Typically, the first line of a page might not be representative of the entire page due to formatting, paragraph breaks, or other editorial decisions. As a result, the first line could have a different distribution of word lengths compared to the rest of the page.

Given this variability and the specific focus on the first line, Investigator 2's measurements might be more susceptible to outliers and could potentially record a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

However, without specific data on the distribution of word lengths across the book, it's challenging to make a definitive prediction. Therefore, a reasonable assumption based on the variability and the focus on the first line might lean towards Investigator 2 recording more units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
