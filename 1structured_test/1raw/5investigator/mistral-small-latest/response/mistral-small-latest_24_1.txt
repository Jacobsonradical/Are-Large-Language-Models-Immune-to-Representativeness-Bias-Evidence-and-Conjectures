Based on the information provided, it's difficult to determine which investigator recorded a larger number without more details about the book's text distribution. However, if we assume that the text is relatively consistent throughout the book, it's possible that Investigator 1 would record more pages with an average word-length of 6 or more, as they are considering entire pages, which could contain more text and thus more long words. On the other hand, if the first lines of the pages tend to have shorter sentences or simpler language, Investigator 2 might record fewer lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. Without specific data on the text distribution, it's challenging to predict with certainty. But considering the possible variations in text complexity and sentence length, I would lean towards:

{investigator: 1}
