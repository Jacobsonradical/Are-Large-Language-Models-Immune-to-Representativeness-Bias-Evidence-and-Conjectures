To determine which investigator recorded a larger number, we need to consider the distribution of word lengths and the structure of the text.

If the text has a lot of variability in word lengths within pages or lines, it is possible that some pages or lines will have a significantly higher average word length than others. Given that the overall average word length in the book is 4, it suggests that many pages and lines will have averages close to this number, but some might have higher averages due to the presence of longer words.

Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which typically contain more words than a single line. Therefore, there is a higher chance that a page will have a mix of word lengths that average out to close to 4. However, if there are longer words scattered throughout the text, some pages might still have an average word length of 6 or more.

Investigator 2 is focusing on the first line of each page. The first line might contain introductory phrases or sentences that could have longer words, potentially leading to a higher average word length for those lines.

Given these considerations, it is plausible that Investigator 2 might record a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more, especially if the first lines tend to have longer words.

Therefore, my answer is:
{investigator: 2}
