Let's analyze the information given.

- The overall average word-length in the entire book is 4.
- Investigator 1 is looking at pages, and Investigator 2 is looking at lines.
- Both are interested in units (pages or lines) that have an average word-length of 6 or more.

Since the overall average is 4, it suggests that many pages and lines will have averages below 6. However, due to variability, some pages and lines will naturally have higher averages, possibly exceeding 6.

Considering the variability in word-lengths, it is likely that some pages and lines will have significantly higher averages, especially if there are longer words clustered together. The clustering of longer words could affect lines more significantly than pages, as a single line with a few very long words can have a much higher average than a page with a more even distribution of word-lengths.

Therefore, Investigator 2, who is looking at lines, might find more units with an average word-length of 6 or more because lines can have more pronounced spikes in word-length due to their shorter length compared to a whole page.

So, I would expect Investigator 2 to record a larger number of such units.
