Based on the given information, I would expect Investigator 2 to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of any page might contain longer words or more complex sentences, which could lead to a higher average word-length in those lines compared to the entire page. Therefore, my answer is:

{investigator: 2}
