Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

1. The overall average word-length in the book is 4, which means that most pages and lines likely have an average word-length below 6.
2. However, since some pages or lines will have a higher average word-length, those with a significantly higher average (like 6 or more) will stand out more in lines than in pages.
3. A single long word can significantly increase the average word-length of a line, making it more likely for a line to have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to a whole page.

Therefore, I predict that Investigator 2 recorded more such units.
