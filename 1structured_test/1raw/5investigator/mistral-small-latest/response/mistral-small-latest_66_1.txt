Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 1 recorded more units. Here's why:

- Investigator 1 is looking at every page, which means they are considering a larger sample size (all words on a page) compared to Investigator 2 who is only looking at the first line of each page (a smaller sample size).
- A larger sample size is more likely to include variations and outliers, which could lead to more pages having an average word-length of 6 or more.
- Additionally, if the book has some pages with very long words or many short words, this could significantly affect the average word-length of those pages, potentially pushing them above the 6 threshold.

Therefore, my answer is: {investigator: 1}
