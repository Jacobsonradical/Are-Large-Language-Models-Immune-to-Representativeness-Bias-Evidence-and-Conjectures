Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's why:

1. Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which typically contains the title, headings, or important initial information. These lines often have longer words (e.g., proper nouns, technical terms) compared to the rest of the page.

2. Investigator 1 is averaging word-length across entire pages, which include shorter, more common words that likely bring down the average word-length.

3. Given that the overall average word-length in the book is 4, it's more likely that the first lines of pages (investigated by Investigator 2) will have a higher average word-length due to the reasons mentioned above.

Therefore, I would guess that Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
