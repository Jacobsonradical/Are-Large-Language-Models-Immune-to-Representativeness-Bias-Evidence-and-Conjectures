Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which contain many words. Even if a page has a few very long words, the overall average might still be below 6 because of the large number of shorter words.
- Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which typically contains fewer words. If a line has even one or two very long words, the average word-length can more easily reach or exceed 6.

Therefore, I predict that Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
