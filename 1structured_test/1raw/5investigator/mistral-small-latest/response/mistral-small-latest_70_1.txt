Based on the information provided, here's a logical approach to the problem:

1. The overall average word-length in the entire book is 4.
2. Some pages or lines may have higher or lower average word-lengths.
3. Investigator 1 looked at entire pages, while Investigator 2 looked at the first lines of each page.

Given that the overall average is 4, pages or lines with an average word-length of 6 or more are significantly above average. These instances are likely to be less frequent than those with average word-lengths closer to 4.

Since a line is a subset of a page, it is more likely that a line within a page has a high average word-length (due to fewer words), compared to the entire page having a high average word-length (due to more words diluting the impact of longer words).

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, as compared to Investigator 1 for entire pages.

So, the answer is:
{investigator: 2}
