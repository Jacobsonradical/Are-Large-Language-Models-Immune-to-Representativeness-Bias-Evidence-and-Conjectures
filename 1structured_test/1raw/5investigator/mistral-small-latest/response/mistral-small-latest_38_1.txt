Based on the information provided, I would expect that Investigator 1 recorded a larger number of such units compared to Investigator 2. This is because the average word-length in the entire book is 4, which suggests that most pages and lines have an average word-length lower than 6. However, since pages typically contain more words than lines, there might be a higher chance for some pages to have a few longer words that push their average word-length over 6.

Therefore, my answer is:
{investigator: 1}
