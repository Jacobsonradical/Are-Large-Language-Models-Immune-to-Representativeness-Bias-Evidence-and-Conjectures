Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which might contain longer words or more complex sentences compared to the rest of the page. This is because the first line could include the start of a new paragraph, which often contains longer words and more complex structures.
- On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length of entire pages. The average word-length of a page is likely to be lower than that of a single line, as the page includes a mix of shorter and longer words.

Therefore, I would predict that Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
