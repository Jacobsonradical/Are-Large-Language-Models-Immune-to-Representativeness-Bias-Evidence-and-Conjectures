Based on the information provided, it is likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of any page could potentially have longer words due to the structure and grammar of the sentence starting a new section. Therefore, the average word-length in the first line of each page is more likely to be higher than the average word-length of the entire page.

So, the answer is:
{investigator: 2}
