Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- Investigator 1 considers entire pages, which contain multiple lines. Even if a few lines have long words, the average word-length might still be below 6 if other lines have shorter words.
- Investigator 2 considers only the first line of each page. If that line happens to have many long words, it's more likely to have an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to the entire page.

Therefore, I would answer: {investigator: 2}
