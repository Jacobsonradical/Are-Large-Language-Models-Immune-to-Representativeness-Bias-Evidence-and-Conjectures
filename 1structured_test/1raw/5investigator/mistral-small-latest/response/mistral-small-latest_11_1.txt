To determine which investigator likely recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the distribution of word-lengths in the book.

The average word-length in the entire book is 4. This suggests that most words are around this length, with some shorter and some longer. When considering a line of text, it's possible for the first line on a page to have a particularly high average word-length due to the random distribution of longer and shorter words.

Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which likely have more words than a single line. The law of large numbers suggests that the average word-length on a page should be closer to the overall book average (4) because any outliers (very short or very long words) are averaged out over many words. Therefore, it is less likely that an entire page would have an average word-length of 6 or more.

Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which may contain fewer words and thus be more susceptible to variability. A short line with a few long words could easily have an average word-length of 6 or more.

Given these considerations, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 recorded pages with the same average.

Therefore, the answer is:
{investigator: 2}
