Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- The first line of a page might contain more long words or fewer short words compared to the rest of the page, leading to a higher average word-length. This is especially true if the first line tends to be a title, header, or a sentence that starts a new section or topic.
- Since Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, they might capture more instances of higher average word-lengths, as these lines may not be representative of the entire page's average word-length.

Therefore, my answer is: {investigator: 2}
