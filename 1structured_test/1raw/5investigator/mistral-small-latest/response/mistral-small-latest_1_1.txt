To determine which investigator recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the distribution of word lengths within the book.

Given:
- The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
- Some pages and lines may have a higher average word-length, and some may have a lower average word-length.

To make an informed guess, let's consider some possible scenarios:

1. **Investigator 1 (Pages)**:
   - If the word lengths are relatively consistent throughout the book, then the average word-length per page might be close to the overall average of 4.
   - However, if there are variations, some pages might have longer words, leading to higher average word-lengths on those pages.

2. **Investigator 2 (Lines)**:
   - The first line of each page might vary significantly from the rest of the page due to variations in sentence structure, paragraph beginnings, or specific linguistic features.
   - If the first lines often contain longer words (e.g., introductory sentences, technical terms, etc.), the average word-length for these lines could be higher than the page average.

Given these considerations, it is plausible that the first lines of the pages could have higher average word-lengths more frequently than the entire pages, due to the variability and potential for longer words at the beginning of sentences or paragraphs.

Therefore, I would lean towards thinking that:

{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2, who counted the number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, may have recorded a larger number of such units.
