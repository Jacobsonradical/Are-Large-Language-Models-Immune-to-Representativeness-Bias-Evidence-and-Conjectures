Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 1 recorded more units (pages) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the average word-length across the entire book is 4, which suggests that most pages and lines will have averages below 6. Since pages contain more words than single lines, it's more likely that a page will have a higher average word-length due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, I would predict that Investigator 1 recorded more such units.
