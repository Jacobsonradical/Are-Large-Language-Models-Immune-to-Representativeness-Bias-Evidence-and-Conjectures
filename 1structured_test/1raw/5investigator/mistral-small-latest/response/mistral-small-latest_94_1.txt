Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's why:

Investigator 1 is looking at average word-length per page, which is likely to be more stable and less affected by outliers (long words) compared to Investigator 2 who is looking at the first line of each page. The first line of a page might often start with a long word (e.g., a proper noun or a long adjective), which could skew the average word-length upwards, making it more likely to reach or exceed 6.

So, my answer is:
{investigator: 2}
