{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is likely to record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more because the first line of a page may have longer words meant to grab the reader's attention. This could lead to a higher average word-length for the first line compared to the entire page. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who is looking at the average word-length across the entire page.
