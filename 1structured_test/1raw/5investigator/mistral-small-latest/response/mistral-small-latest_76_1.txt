Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

1. The average word-length for the entire book is 4, which means there are many short words.
2. A page with a high average word-length (6 or more) likely contains some very long words, which would significantly increase the average.
3. In contrast, a line with a high average word-length (6 or more) could be achieved with fewer long words, as lines are shorter than pages.
4. Therefore, it's possible for a line to have a high average word-length without containing extremely long words, making it easier to achieve a high average in a line compared to a page.

So, I would guess that Investigator 2 recorded more such units.
