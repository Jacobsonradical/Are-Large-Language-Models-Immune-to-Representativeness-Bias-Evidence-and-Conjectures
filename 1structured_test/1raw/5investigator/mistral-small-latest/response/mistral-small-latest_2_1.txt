Given that the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it's likely that the distribution of word-lengths across pages and lines is relatively even. However, since the average is a central tendency measure, there will be variability around this average.

Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length per page, while Investigator 2 is looking at the average word-length per line within each page. Typically, the variability in word-lengths within a single line will be less than the variability across an entire page because a line contains fewer words than a page.

Therefore, it is more likely that a higher proportion of lines will have an average word-length close to the overall average compared to pages. Consequently, fewer lines are likely to have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to pages.

Thus, I predict that Investigator 1 recorded more such units.
