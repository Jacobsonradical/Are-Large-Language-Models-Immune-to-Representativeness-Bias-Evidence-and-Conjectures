Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 1 recorded more units because:

- The average word-length in the entire book is 4, which is significantly lower than 6.
- Therefore, it's less likely that the first line of each page would have an average word-length of 6 or more, as it's just one line and the overall average is lower.
- In contrast, a full page could have a higher average word-length due to longer words spread throughout the page.

So, I would say:
{investigator: 1}
