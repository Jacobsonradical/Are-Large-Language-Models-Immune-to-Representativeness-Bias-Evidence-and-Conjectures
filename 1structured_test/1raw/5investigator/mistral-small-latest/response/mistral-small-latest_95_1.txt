To determine which investigator recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the distribution of word-lengths throughout the book.

Given that the average word-length in the entire book is 4, we can infer that there is a balance between shorter and longer words. However, the specific distribution of word-lengths on individual pages and lines can vary significantly.

Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length per page. If the book has a consistent distribution of word-lengths across pages, it is likely that some pages will have an average word-length of 6 or more, especially if there are a few longer words concentrated on those pages.

Investigator 2 is looking at the average word-length per line. Lines generally contain fewer words than entire pages, so the presence of even a single long word in a line can significantly raise the average word-length of that line.

Considering the potential for longer words to have a greater impact on the average word-length of lines compared to pages, Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Therefore, I would say:

{investigator: 2}
