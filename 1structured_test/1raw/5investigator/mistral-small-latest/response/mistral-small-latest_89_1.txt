Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 1 recorded a larger number of units (pages with an average word-length of 6 or more). Here's why:

- Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length of entire pages, which can consist of many words. A few long words can significantly increase the average word-length of a page.
- Investigator 2 is looking at the average word-length of the first lines of each page, which typically contain fewer words. It's less likely that these lines will have a high average word-length because there are fewer words to balance out or skew the average.

Therefore, I predict that Investigator 1 recorded more such units.
