Based on the information provided, I would expect that Investigator 1 recorded a larger number of units (pages with an average word-length of 6 or more) compared to Investigator 2. This is because the average word-length of the entire book is 4, and the threshold for both investigators is 6, which is significantly higher than the average. Therefore, it's likely that pages with an average word-length of 6 or more would be less common than lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, as the line average is calculated from a smaller sample size (just the first line) compared to the page average (all words on the page). Hence, I would answer:

{investigator: 1}
