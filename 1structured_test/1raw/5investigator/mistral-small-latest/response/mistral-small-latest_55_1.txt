Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- The overall average word-length in the book is 4, which is below the threshold of 6.
- The first line of a page might be more likely to contain longer words or technical terms, as it often introduces the topic of the page.
- Therefore, Investigator 2, who focused on the first line of each page, might have encountered more instances of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

So, my answer is: {investigator: 2}
