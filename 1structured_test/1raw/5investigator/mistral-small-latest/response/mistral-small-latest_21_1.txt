To determine which investigator recorded a larger number of units (pages for Investigator 1, lines for Investigator 2) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability and distribution of word lengths across the book.

Given that the overall average word-length in the entire book is 4, this implies that a significant portion of the words are likely around this average, with some variation. The fact that not every line or page has exactly the average word-length suggests there is variability.

Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which typically contain more words than a single line. The average word-length of a page is likely to be more stable and representative of the overall average because it is based on a larger sample size (more words per page than words per line). Therefore, it is less likely that a page will have an average word-length of 6 or more because the larger sample size tends to moderate extremes.

Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which contains fewer words. The average word-length of a single line can be more variable and prone to higher values due to the smaller sample size. A few long words in a short line can significantly increase the average word-length of that line.

Based on this reasoning, Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, because the variability in word-lengths is more pronounced in shorter samples (lines) compared to longer samples (pages).

Therefore, the answer is:
{investigator: 2}
