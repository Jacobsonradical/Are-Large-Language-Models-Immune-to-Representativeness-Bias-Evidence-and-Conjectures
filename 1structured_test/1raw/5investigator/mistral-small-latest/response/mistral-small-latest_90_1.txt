Based on the information provided, it's challenging to definitively determine which investigator recorded a larger number of units without additional data about the book's layout and language usage patterns. However, considering the averages and the nature of the measurements:

- **Investigator 1** is looking at the average word-length per **page**, which typically contains more words than a single line. Pages with longer words might have higher average word-lengths, but there could be variability across different pages.

- **Investigator 2** is looking at the average word-length per **first line** in each page. The first line might not represent the entire page's word-length distribution accurately, but if it contains particularly long words, it could have a higher average.

Given the variability and the fact that investigator 1 is examining whole pages (which generally have more words and potentially more variability in word length), it is plausible that investigator 1 might record more pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.

So, I would lean towards:

{investigator: 1}
