To determine which investigator recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the structure and variability of the text.

Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, while Investigator 2 is looking at the first lines of those pages. The average word-length for the entire book is 4, which suggests that most pages and lines will have an average word-length closer to this number. However, since some pages or lines will have longer words, they may have an average word-length of 6 or more.

Generally, the variability in word-length within a single line is likely to be higher than the variability across an entire page. This is because a single line may contain a few very long words, while a page with many more words is likely to have a more balanced distribution of word-lengths. Therefore, it is plausible that Investigator 2 might find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, as a line can have a few very long words that significantly raise its average.

Given these considerations, it is likely that:

{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
