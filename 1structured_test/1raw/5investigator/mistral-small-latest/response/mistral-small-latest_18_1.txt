Based on the information provided, it's more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page might have longer words that set the tone for the entire page, but subsequent lines could have shorter words that balance out the average. Therefore, the first line is more likely to have a higher average word-length than the overall page.

So, the answer is: {investigator: 2}
