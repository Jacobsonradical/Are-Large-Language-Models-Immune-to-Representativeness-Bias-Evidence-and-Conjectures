Based on the provided information, it's challenging to definitively determine which investigator recorded a larger number without additional data about the text's distribution and the specifics of the book's layout. However, considering the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it suggests that most pages and lines will have an average word-length closer to 4. Therefore, pages and lines with an average word-length of 6 or more would be relatively rare.

Without specific details about the variance in word-lengths across different pages and lines, it's reasonable to assume that the distributions could be similar or different. Given the lack of specific data, a plausible guess would be that they are about the same (within 5% of each other).

So, my answer would be:
{investigator: 3}
