Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's why:

- The average word-length in the entire book is 4, which means most pages and lines will have an average word-length below 6.
- Since Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, these lines are likely to have a more varied average word-length due to their shorter length compared to an entire page. This could lead to more lines having an average word-length of 6 or more.
- In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length of entire pages, which might be more stable and less likely to reach 6 or more due to the averaging effect of more words.

Therefore, I predict that Investigator 2 recorded more such units.
