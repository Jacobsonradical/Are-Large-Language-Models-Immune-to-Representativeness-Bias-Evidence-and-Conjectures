Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which likely contain more words than just one line. This means that even if a page has a few long words, the average word-length might not reach 6 because it's diluted by the presence of many shorter words on the page.
- Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page. The first line might be a title, heading, or start of a paragraph, which often contains longer words or fewer words overall, making it more likely to have an average word-length of 6 or more.

Therefore, my answer is:
{investigator: 2}
