{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
The first line of each page is likely to be longer than the average line in the page due to typical sentence structure and paragraph formatting. Longer words and sentences often start at the beginning of a paragraph or line, which could result in a higher average word-length for the first line compared to the rest of the page. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
