{investigator: 2}

Explanation: Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page may contain longer words or more complex sentences, which can lead to a higher average word-length compared to the entire page. Additionally, the variability in word-length is likely to be higher in a single line compared to an entire page, leading to a greater chance of a line having an average word-length of 6 or more.
