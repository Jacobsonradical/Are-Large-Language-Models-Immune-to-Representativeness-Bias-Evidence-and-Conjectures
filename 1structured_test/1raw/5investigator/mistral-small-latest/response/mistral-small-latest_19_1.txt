Based on the information provided, I would expect Investigator 2 to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that the first line of a page might often contain longer words or more complex sentences, which could lead to a higher average word-length compared to the entire page. Therefore, I would guess that Investigator 2 (line averages) likely recorded more such units.

So, my answer is:
{investigator: 2}
