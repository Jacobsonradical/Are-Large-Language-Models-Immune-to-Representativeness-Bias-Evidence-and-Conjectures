Based on the information provided, it is likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. This is because the first line of a page, which is what Investigator 2 studied, is often the start of a new paragraph or section, which can have longer words or technical terms that increase the average word-length. In contrast, the average word-length across an entire page, as studied by Investigator 1, is likely to be more balanced and closer to the overall average of the book. Therefore, I would say:

{investigator: 2}
