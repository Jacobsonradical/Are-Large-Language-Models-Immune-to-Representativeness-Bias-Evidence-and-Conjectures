Based on the information provided, I would expect Investigator 1 to have recorded a larger number of units (pages) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the average word-length of the entire book is 4, which suggests that most pages and lines have an average word-length below 6. Therefore, it's likely that there are fewer pages with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to lines, as lines are shorter and thus more susceptible to variations in word-length.

So, my answer is:
{investigator: 1}
