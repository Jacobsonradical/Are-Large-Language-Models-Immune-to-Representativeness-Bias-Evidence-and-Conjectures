Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- The entire book has an average word-length of 4.
- A page consists of multiple lines, so the average word-length of a page is likely to be more stable and less influenced by outliers compared to a single line.
- Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that pages with an average word-length of 6 or more will contain lines with even higher average word-lengths, especially the first lines of those pages.

So, I would answer: {investigator: 2}
