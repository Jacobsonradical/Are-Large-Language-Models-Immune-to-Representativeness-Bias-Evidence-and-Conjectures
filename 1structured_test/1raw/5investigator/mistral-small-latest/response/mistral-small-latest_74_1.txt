{investigator1: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which contain many words and thus the average word-length per page is likely to be more stable and closer to the overall average of 4. Therefore, it's less likely for a whole page to have an average word-length of 6 or more.

Investigator 2 is looking at single lines, which contain fewer words. This means the average word-length per line can vary more widely from the overall average. It's more likely for a single line to have an average word-length of 6 or more due to this variability.

Therefore, Investigator 2 is likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
