Based on the information provided, it's more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which contain many words. The average word-length of 4 means that most words are around this length, with some longer and some shorter. It's less likely that an entire page would have an average word-length of 6 or more because the longer words would need to be quite frequent to pull the average up that high for an entire page.

- Investigator 2 is looking at single lines, which contain fewer words. It's more likely that a line could have an average word-length of 6 or more because it takes fewer long words to increase the average in a small sample size. Additionally, lines at the beginning of chapters or sections might contain longer words like proper nouns or technical terms, further increasing the likelihood of a higher average word-length.

Therefore, I would answer: {investigator: 2}
