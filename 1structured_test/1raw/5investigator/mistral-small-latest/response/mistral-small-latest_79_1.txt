Based on the information provided, it's difficult to determine which investigator recorded a larger number without additional details such as the distribution of word lengths, the number of words per line, and the number of lines per page. However, if we assume a relatively uniform distribution of word lengths across the book, it's likely that the average word length in the first line of each page would be similar to the overall average word length of the entire page. Therefore, I would lean towards:

{investigator: 3} - They are about the same (within 5% of each other).
