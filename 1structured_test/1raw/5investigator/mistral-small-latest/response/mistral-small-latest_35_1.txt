{investigator: 2}

Explanation: Generally, the first line of a page may contain longer words or more complex sentences, which could lead to a higher average word-length compared to the entire page. Therefore, Investigator 2, who focused on the first line of each page, is more likely to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
