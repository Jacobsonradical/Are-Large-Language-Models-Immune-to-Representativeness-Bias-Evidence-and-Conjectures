Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 1 recorded more units (pages) with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- The overall average word-length in the book is 4, which is lower than the threshold of 6.
- To have an average word-length of 6 or more, a page or line would need to have a concentration of longer words.
- A single line is likely to have fewer words than an entire page, so the impact of a few long words on the average word-length is more significant for a line than for a page.
- Therefore, it's more likely that lines with an average word-length of 6 or more are rarer than pages with the same average, leading to Investigator 1 recording more units.

So, my answer is: {investigator: 1}
