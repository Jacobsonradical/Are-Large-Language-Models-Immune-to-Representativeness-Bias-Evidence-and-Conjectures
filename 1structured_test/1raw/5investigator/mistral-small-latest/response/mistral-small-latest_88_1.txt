To determine which investigator recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the distribution of word lengths across pages and lines.

Given:
- The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
- Some pages and lines may have a higher average word-length, some lower.

**Investigator 1** (Pages):
- Counts the number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.

**Investigator 2** (Lines):
- Counts the number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

**Analysis**:
1. **Investigator 1 (Pages)**:
   - A page with an average word-length of 6 or more indicates that most words on that page are relatively long.
   - The variability in word lengths is averaged out over the entire page, so a higher average word-length on a page suggests a consistent presence of longer words.

2. **Investigator 2 (Lines)**:
   - A line with an average word-length of 6 or more indicates that the words in that line are relatively long.
   - The first line of a page might not necessarily represent the word-length distribution of the entire page.

**Prediction**:
- Since the average word-length of the entire book is 4, there will be pages with varying distributions of word lengths.
- Pages with a higher average word-length are likely to have lines with a higher average word-length as well.
- However, lines with a higher average word-length may not be representative of the entire page's word-length distribution.

**Conclusion**:
- Investigator 1 is likely to record more pages with an average word-length of 6 or more because this criterion is based on the consistent distribution across the entire page.
- Investigator 2 might record fewer lines with an average word-length of 6 or more because the first line of a page might not reflect the overall word-length distribution of that page.

Therefore, I predict that Investigator 1 recorded more such units.
