Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 1 recorded more units. Here's why:

- The overall average word length is 4, which means that most pages and lines will have an average word length below 6.
- Pages have more words than lines, so a page is more likely to balance out longer words with shorter ones, making it less likely to have an average word length of 6 or more.
- Lines, on the other hand, have fewer words, so they're more susceptible to having an average word length of 6 or more if they contain even a single long word.

Therefore, I predict that Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word length of 6 or more.
