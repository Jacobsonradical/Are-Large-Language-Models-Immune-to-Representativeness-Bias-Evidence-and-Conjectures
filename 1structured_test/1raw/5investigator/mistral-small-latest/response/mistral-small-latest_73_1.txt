Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 1 recorded more units (pages with an average word-length of 6 or more) than Investigator 2 (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because the average word-length of the entire book is 4, which means that most pages and lines will have an average word-length below 6. However, since pages contain more words than lines, it's more likely for a page to have a few long words that would increase its average word-length to 6 or more, compared to a line which has fewer words and is less likely to have such a high average. Therefore, I predict that Investigator 1 recorded more such units.
