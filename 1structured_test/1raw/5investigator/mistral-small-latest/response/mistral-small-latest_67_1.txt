Based on the given information, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which contain more words and thus more data points. The average word-length of a page is likely to be closer to the overall book average (4) due to the law of large numbers.
- Investigator 2 is looking at single lines, which contain fewer words. With fewer data points, the average word-length of a line is more likely to deviate from the overall book average, potentially reaching 6 or more.

Therefore, I predict that Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
