{investigator: 1}

Explanation: Given the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it is likely that most pages and lines have an average word-length close to 4. However, since some pages or lines may have a higher average word-length due to variations in text, it is more probable that pages (which contain more words) will have a higher average word-length of 6 or more compared to individual lines. Therefore, Investigator 1, who examined entire pages, is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
