Based on the information provided, I would expect that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. This is because the first line of each page may have shorter words on average compared to the rest of the page, especially if the first line is a title or a short sentence. Therefore, it's more likely that the first line's average word-length is below the book's average of 4, making it less likely to reach the threshold of 6 or more. Therefore, I predict that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

So, my answer is: {investigator: 2}
