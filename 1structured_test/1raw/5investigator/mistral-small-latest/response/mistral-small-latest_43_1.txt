Given that the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it implies that the majority of the text likely consists of words closer to this average length. Words with lengths significantly above the average (such as 6 or more) are likely less frequent.

Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which contain a larger sample of words compared to a single line. This larger sample size would tend to average out extreme values, making it less likely that a whole page would have an average word-length of 6 or more.

Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page. A single line with only a few words could more easily have an average word-length of 6 or more if even one or two long words are present.

Therefore, Investigator 2 is likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more because a few long words in a short line can skew the average more significantly than in a whole page.

So, the answer is:
{investigator: 2}
