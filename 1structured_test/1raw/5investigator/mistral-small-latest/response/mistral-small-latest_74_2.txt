I would lean towards thinking that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's why:

- Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length per page, which is a larger sample size (an entire page of words) compared to the first line. This could lead to more averaging out of longer and shorter words, potentially resulting in fewer pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.

- Investigator 2 is looking at the average word-length of just the first line of each page. This is a smaller, potentially more variable sample size, which could lead to more instances where the average word-length is 6 or more due to the presence of one or two longer words in a short line.

Therefore, my answer would be:
{investigator: 2}
