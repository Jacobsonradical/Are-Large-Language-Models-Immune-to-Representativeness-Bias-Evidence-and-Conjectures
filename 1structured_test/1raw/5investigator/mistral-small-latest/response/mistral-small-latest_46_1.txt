Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's why:

- Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which contain many words, so the average word-length per page is likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4. Only a few pages with a very high concentration of long words would have an average of 6 or more.

- Investigator 2, on the other hand, is looking at single lines, which contain fewer words. It's easier for a line with just a few long words to have an average word-length of 6 or more.

Therefore, I predict that Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
