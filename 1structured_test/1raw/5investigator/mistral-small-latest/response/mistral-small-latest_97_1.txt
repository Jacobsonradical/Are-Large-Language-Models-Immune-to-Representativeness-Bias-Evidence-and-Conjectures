Based on the information given, it's likely that Investigator 1 recorded a larger number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- The overall average word-length in the book is 4.
- Pages with an average word-length of 6 or more are significantly above this average.
- Lines, being shorter, may have more variation in word-length from line to line, which could lead to fewer lines having an average word-length of 6 or more.

So, my answer is: {investigator: 1}
