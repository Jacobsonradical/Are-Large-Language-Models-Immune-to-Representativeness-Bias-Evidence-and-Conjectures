Given the information provided, we need to compare the number of units (pages versus lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Let's analyze the potential outcomes:

1. **Investigator 1** (pages):
   - The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
   - Pages with an average word-length of 6 or more would have significantly longer words compared to the overall average.

2. **Investigator 2** (lines):
   - The first line of each page might contain shorter words on average compared to the entire page, due to variability in word lengths throughout the page.
   - Therefore, it is possible that the first line might have a lower average word-length compared to the entire page.

Considering these points, it is likely that **Investigator 1** will record a larger number of units (pages) with an average word-length of 6 or more, as entire pages with such high averages are less common than lines with such high averages.

So, the answer is:
{ investigator: 1 }
