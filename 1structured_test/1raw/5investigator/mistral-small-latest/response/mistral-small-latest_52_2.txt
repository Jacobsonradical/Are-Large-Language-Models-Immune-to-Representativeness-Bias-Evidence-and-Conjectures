Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 1 recorded more units. Here's why:

- The average word-length in the entire book is 4, which means most pages and lines will have an average word-length lower than 6.
- However, pages typically have more words than lines, so there's a higher chance for a page to have a few long words that could bring its average word-length to 6 or more.
- In contrast, lines have fewer words, so it's less likely for a line to have a few long words that could significantly increase its average word-length to 6 or more.

Therefore, I predict that Investigator 1 recorded more units.
