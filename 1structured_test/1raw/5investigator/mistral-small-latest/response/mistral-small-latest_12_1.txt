I would guess that investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's my reasoning:

1. The average word-length in the entire book is 4, which means that most pages and lines will have an average word-length lower than 6.
2. However, since not every line or page has exactly the same average, there will be some variation.
3. In a line, a single long word can significantly increase the average word-length. For example, a line with nine 4-letter words and one 10-letter word has an average word-length of 5.56, which is closer to 6 than the book's overall average.
4. In a page, a single long word has less impact on the average word-length because it's spread across many words. Therefore, it's less likely for a page to have an average word-length of 6 or more.

So, I think investigator 2, who looked at lines, would find more units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Therefore, my answer is: {investigator: 2}.
