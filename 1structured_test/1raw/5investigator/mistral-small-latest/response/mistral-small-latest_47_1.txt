Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's why:

- The average word-length of the entire book is 4, which means that most pages and lines will have an average word-length less than 6.
- However, the first line of a page might have longer words to start a chapter, introduce a character, or set a scene, which could lead to a higher average word-length.
- Therefore, it's probable that Investigator 2, who looked at the first line of each page, found more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

So, the answer is: {investigator: 2}
