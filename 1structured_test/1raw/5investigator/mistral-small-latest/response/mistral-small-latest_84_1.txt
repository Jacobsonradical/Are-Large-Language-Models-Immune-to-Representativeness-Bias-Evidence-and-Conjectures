Based on the provided information, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

- Investigator 1 is considering entire pages, which contain many lines and thus, many words. The average word-length of a page is more likely to be closer to the book's overall average (4) because of the larger sample size (more words).
- Investigator 2 is considering only the first line of each page, which contains fewer words. The average word-length of a single line is more likely to vary from the book's overall average due to the smaller sample size.

Therefore, it's more probable that individual lines will have a higher average word-length (6 or more) than entire pages.

So, my answer is: {investigator: 2}
