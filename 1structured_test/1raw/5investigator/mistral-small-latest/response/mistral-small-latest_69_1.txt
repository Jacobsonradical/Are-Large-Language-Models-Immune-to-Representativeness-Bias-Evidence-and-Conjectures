To determine which investigator recorded a larger number, we need to consider the distribution of word lengths within the book. Given that the average word-length in the entire book is 4, the variance around this average is crucial.

If the word lengths are distributed relatively uniformly across the pages and lines, we might expect that the average word-length on most pages and lines would be close to 4. However, due to the nature of language and text, it is likely that there will be some variability.

Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which typically contain more words than a single line. This means that the average word-length for a page is based on a larger sample size compared to a single line. As a result, the law of large numbers suggests that the page averages should be more stable and closer to the overall average of 4, with fewer extreme values.

Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which likely contains fewer words. This smaller sample size can lead to more variability in the average word-length for individual lines. Therefore, it is more likely that some lines will have an average word-length of 6 or more, simply due to the smaller sample size and potential outliers.

Given these considerations, it is reasonable to expect that Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, due to the increased variability in smaller samples.

Therefore, the answer is:
{investigator: 2}
