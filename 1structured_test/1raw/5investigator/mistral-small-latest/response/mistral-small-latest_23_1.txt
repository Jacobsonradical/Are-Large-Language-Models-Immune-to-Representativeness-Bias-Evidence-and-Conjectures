Based on the information provided, it's difficult to definitively say which investigator recorded a larger number without more specific details about the book's content and layout. However, if we assume a typical distribution of word lengths and a consistent structure across pages and lines, it's likely that the averages would be closer to the overall average of 4. Therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that they may be about the same.

So, my answer is:
{investigator: 3}
