Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 1 recorded more units. Here's why:

- Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which likely contain more words than a single line. This means that there are more opportunities for the average word length to reach or exceed 6.
- Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which likely has fewer words and thus a smaller sample size. This makes it less likely that the average word length will reach or exceed 6.

Therefore, I would predict that Investigator 1 recorded more units.
