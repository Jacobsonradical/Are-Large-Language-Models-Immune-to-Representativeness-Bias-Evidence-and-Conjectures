Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's why:

- Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which contain multiple lines. The average word-length of a page is likely to be more stable and less influenced by extremely short or long words compared to a single line.
- Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page. A single line is more likely to have a high average word-length if it contains a few long words, as the sample size (number of words in a line) is smaller.

Therefore, I predict that Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
