Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's why:

- Investigator 2 is only considering the first line of each page, which is likely to have a higher average word-length due to the placement of longer words at the beginning of the line or page for typographical reasons.
- Investigator 1 is considering the entire page, which includes shorter words and possibly longer words spread out throughout the page.

Therefore, I would predict that Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
