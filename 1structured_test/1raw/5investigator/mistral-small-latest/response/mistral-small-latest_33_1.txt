Based on the information provided, it's difficult to definitively determine which investigator recorded a larger number of units without additional data about the specific book and its language properties. However, considering that the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it suggests that most pages and lines will have average word-lengths closer to this number.

If the distribution of word-lengths is relatively consistent throughout the book, then both investigators might find a similar proportion of pages and lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. Therefore, a reasonable assumption might be that they are about the same (within 5% of each other).

So, my answer would be:

{investigator: 3}
