Let's consider the possibilities:

1. If the book has a very consistent word-length distribution across pages and lines, Investigator 1 and Investigator 2 might record similar numbers.
2. However, if the word-length varies significantly within pages (some words being very short and others very long), the average word-length per page could fluctuate more, potentially leading to more pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
3. On the other hand, if the first lines of pages tend to have longer words or if there's a significant variation in the first lines compared to the rest of the pages, Investigator 2 might record a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Without specific data on the distribution of word-lengths within pages and lines, it's challenging to definitively say which investigator would record a larger number. However, considering the variability in language and the potential for the first lines to be more distinct, it's plausible that Investigator 2 could record more such lines.

Based on this reasoning, I lean towards:

{investigator: 2}
