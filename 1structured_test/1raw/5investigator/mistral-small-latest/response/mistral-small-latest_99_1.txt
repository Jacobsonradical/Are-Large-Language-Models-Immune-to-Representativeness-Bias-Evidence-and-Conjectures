{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page may often contain longer or more descriptive words, such as the title or a heading, which could skew the average word-length of the line higher than the average for the entire page.
