Based on the information provided, it is likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. This is because the first line of each page may contain longer words or more complex sentences, which could lead to a higher average word-length compared to the entire page. Therefore, Investigator 2 may have found more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
