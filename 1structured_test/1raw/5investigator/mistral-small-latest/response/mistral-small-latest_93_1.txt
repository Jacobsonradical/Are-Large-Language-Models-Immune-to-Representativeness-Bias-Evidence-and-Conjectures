Based on the information provided, it's reasonable to assume that the average word-length of a line is likely to be more variable than the average word-length of an entire page. This is because a single page has more words than a single line, and thus the average is calculated over a larger sample size, which tends to be more stable.

Therefore, I believe that Investigator 2, who looked at the average word-length of individual lines, is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more.

So, my answer is: {investigator: 2}
