To determine which investigator recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the distribution of word lengths throughout the book.

Given that the average word-length in the entire book is 4, we can infer that there is a mix of shorter and longer words. However, without specific information about the distribution of word lengths on each page and in each line, it is difficult to definitively determine which investigator would record more units.

If the book has a significant number of long words scattered across many pages, Investigator 1 might record more pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. On the other hand, if the book contains a few pages with exceptionally long words in the first line, Investigator 2 might record more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Without additional data, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer. However, considering the variability in word lengths and the potential for long words to influence both page and line averages, it is plausible that both investigators could record a similar number of units.

Therefore, based on the limited information provided, the most reasonable assumption is:

{investigator: 3}
