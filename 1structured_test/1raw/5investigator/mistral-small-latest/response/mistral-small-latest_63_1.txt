{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page may contain longer words or technical terms that are less likely to be repeated throughout the rest of the page, leading to a higher average word-length in the first line compared to the entire page. Therefore, Investigator 2's sample (the first line of each page) might have more units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
