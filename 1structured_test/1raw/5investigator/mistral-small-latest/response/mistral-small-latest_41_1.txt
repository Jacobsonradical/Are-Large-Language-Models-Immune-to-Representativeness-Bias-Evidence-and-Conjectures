To determine which investigator recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length throughout the book.

Given that the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it suggests that most pages and lines will have an average word-length close to 4. However, the presence of some longer words will likely cause certain pages or lines to have a higher average word-length.

Investigator 1 looked at the average word-length per page. Since pages typically contain a larger number of words compared to a single line, the variability in average word-length per page might be less pronounced. This is because the impact of a few long words is diluted over a larger sample of words.

Investigator 2 looked at the average word-length per line. Since lines contain fewer words, the impact of a few long words can significantly increase the average word-length of that line. Therefore, it is more likely that some lines will have a higher average word-length due to the presence of one or two long words.

Based on this reasoning, Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Therefore, the answer is:
{investigator: 2}
