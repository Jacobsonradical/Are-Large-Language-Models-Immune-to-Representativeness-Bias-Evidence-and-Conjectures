Based on the information provided, it's difficult to determine who recorded more without additional data about the book's layout and word distribution. However, I can discuss the possibilities:

1. If the book has many pages with a few very long words (such as technical terms) and the rest are short words, Investigator 1 might record more pages with an average word-length of 6 or more, as these long words would significantly increase the page's average.

2. If the book has many lines with a consistent number of long words, Investigator 2 might record more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, as these lines would maintain a high average regardless of the page's overall word distribution.

3. If the word distribution is fairly consistent throughout the book, both investigators might record similar numbers.

Given these possibilities, I can't confidently choose one answer over the others. Therefore, the answer is:
{investigator: 3} (They are about the same, within 5% of each other.)
