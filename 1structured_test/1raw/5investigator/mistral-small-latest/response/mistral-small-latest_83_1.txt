{investigator: 2}

Explanation: Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more because the first line of a page often serves as an introduction or a topic sentence, which can contain longer words. Additionally, the first line might include proper nouns, technical terms, or complex phrases that could increase the average word-length.
