Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's why:

- The average word-length in the entire book is 4, which means there are more words with lengths below 6 than above.
- Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, so even if a page has a few long words, the average will be pulled down by the many shorter words.
- Investigator 2, however, is only looking at the first line of each page. This line could potentially contain several long words in a row, making the average word-length of that line much higher than the overall average.

Therefore, I would say {investigator: 2}.
