Based on the information provided, it's likely that Investigator 1 recorded more units. This is because Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which is likely to have more words than a single line. Therefore, it's more probable that a page will have an average word-length of 6 or more than a single line will.

So, the answer is: {investigator: 1}
