Based on the information provided, it's difficult to determine which investigator recorded a larger number without additional data about the distribution of word lengths and how they vary across pages and lines. However, if we assume that the variance in word length is consistent across pages and lines, then it's likely that the number of pages and lines with an average word length of 6 or more would be similar. Therefore, I would lean towards:

{investigator: 3} (They are about the same, within 5% of each other.)
