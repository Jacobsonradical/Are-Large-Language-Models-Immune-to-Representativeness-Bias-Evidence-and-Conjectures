To answer this question, we need to consider the distribution of word lengths within the pages and lines of the book.

If the distribution of word lengths is relatively consistent throughout the book, then the average word length on each page and in each line would likely be close to the overall average of 4. However, since the question specifies that not every line or page has exactly that average, there is variation.

Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which contain multiple lines. The averaging effect of having more words (i.e., multiple lines per page) might make it less likely for any single page to have an average word length as high as 6 or more.

Investigator 2, on the other hand, is looking at individual lines. Because each line has fewer words compared to an entire page, there is a higher likelihood that any given line could have an average word length of 6 or more due to fewer data points influencing the average.

Given this reasoning, Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more.

Therefore, the answer is:
{investigator: 2}
