{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more because the first line of a page can vary significantly in length and complexity compared to the rest of the page. It could contain longer words or more complex sentences, leading to a higher average word-length. In contrast, the average word-length for an entire page is likely to be more stable and closer to the overall average of the book, which is 4. Therefore, fewer pages are likely to have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of lines with such an average.
