{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at the average word length of an entire page.** This means they are taking into account all the words on the page, which is likely to result in a more consistent average closer to the overall book average of 4. 
* **Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page.**  A single line is much smaller than a whole page, meaning the average word length is more susceptible to variations from the overall book average. It's more likely to have lines with unusually high or low average word lengths.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find fewer pages with an average word length of 6 or more, as their data is based on a larger sample size.
