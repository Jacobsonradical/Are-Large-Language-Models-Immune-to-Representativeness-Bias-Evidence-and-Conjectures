{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is working with larger samples:**  A page has significantly more words than a single line.  
* **Greater variation within a page:**  Within a page, there's likely to be more variation in word length. This means there's a higher chance that a page will contain a mix of short and long words, resulting in an average word length of 6 or more.
* **Less variation within a line:** A single line is less likely to have a wide range of word lengths, making it less probable to reach an average of 6 or more. 

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find a larger number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
