{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 considers the entire page:**  The average word length of an entire page is more likely to be closer to the overall book average (4) than the average word length of a single line.
* **Investigator 2 focuses on a single line:**  A single line can have a much higher word length average due to a few long words, even if the page overall has a lower average.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find more pages with an average word length of 6 or more, because their measurement is less susceptible to fluctuations caused by single long words.
