{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1** is analyzing an entire page. This means they have a larger sample size of words to calculate the average. 
* **Investigator 2** is only looking at the first line of each page. This is a significantly smaller sample size.

It's more likely that a longer average word length (6 or more) will occur over a larger sample of words (entire page) than a smaller sample (one line).
