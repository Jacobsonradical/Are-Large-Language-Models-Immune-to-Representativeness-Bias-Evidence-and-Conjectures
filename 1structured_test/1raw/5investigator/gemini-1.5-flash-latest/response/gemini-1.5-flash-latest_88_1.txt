{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are likely to appear at the beginning of sentences:**  It's more common for longer, more impactful words to start sentences. 
* **First lines often have longer words:** Since investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, they are more likely to capture these longer words that start sentences.

Therefore, investigator 1, who looks at the average word length across the entire page, is likely to encounter a wider variety of words, including shorter ones, resulting in a lower frequency of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
