{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to be spread across multiple lines:**  A long word like "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" is more likely to be split between lines than a short word like "and". 
* **Investigator 1 averages across the whole page:** This means that a single long word can influence the average word length of the entire page, increasing the chances of it having an average of 6 or more. 
* **Investigator 2 averages just one line:**  The influence of a single long word on the line average is smaller, making it less likely that a line will have an average word length of 6 or more. 

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 recorded a larger number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
