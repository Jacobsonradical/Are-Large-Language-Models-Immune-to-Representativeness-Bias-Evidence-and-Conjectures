{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes full pages:**  A page likely contains a wider variety of sentence structures and word lengths.  It's more probable that a page will have at least one section with longer words to pull the average up to 6 or more.
* **Investigator 2 analyzes single lines:** A single line is more likely to be influenced by short words, as sentences often start with articles, prepositions, or conjunctions.  It's less likely that a single line will have enough long words to push the average to 6 or more.

Therefore, Investigator 1, analyzing full pages, is more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
