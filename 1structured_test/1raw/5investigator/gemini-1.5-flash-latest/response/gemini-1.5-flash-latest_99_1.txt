{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1** is analyzing the entire page.  This means they are considering a much larger sample of words, making it more likely to find pages where the average word length is 6 or more. 
* **Investigator 2** is only looking at the first line of each page.  This is a smaller sample, so it's less likely to capture instances where the average word length is 6 or more.

While it's possible that some pages might have very long first lines, it's far more likely that the average word length across an entire page will be closer to the book's overall average of 4.
