{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to appear on full pages:**  Full pages are more likely to contain a wider variety of words, including longer, more complex words that contribute to a higher average word length.
* **Lines are shorter and less diverse:**  Lines, particularly the first lines of pages, are often introductory and may contain shorter, more common words. This makes it less likely for a single line to have an average word length of 6 or more. 

Therefore, investigator 1, analyzing entire pages, is more likely to find a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
