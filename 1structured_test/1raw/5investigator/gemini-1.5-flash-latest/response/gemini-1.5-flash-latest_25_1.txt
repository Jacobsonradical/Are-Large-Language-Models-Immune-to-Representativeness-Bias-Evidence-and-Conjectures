{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 considers the entire page:**  They are calculating the average word length across all words on a page.  This means they have a larger sample size for each calculation.
* **Investigator 2 focuses on a single line:** They only consider the words in the first line of each page.  This is a much smaller sample size. 

It's likely that a single line is more susceptible to fluctuations in average word length than a whole page.  A single long word on a line could dramatically increase the average.  This makes it more probable that Investigator 1 will find more pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
