{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to appear in longer lines.**  A single long word in a line will significantly raise the average word length of that line. 
* **Pages have more words.**  Since pages have more words than lines, they have more opportunities to include long words, which can bring the average word length closer to or above 6.

Therefore, Investigator 1, who is looking at the average word length across entire pages, is more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
