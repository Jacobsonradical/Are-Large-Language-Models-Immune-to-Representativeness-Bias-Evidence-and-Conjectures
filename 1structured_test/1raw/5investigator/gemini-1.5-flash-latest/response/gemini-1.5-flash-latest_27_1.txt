{investigator: 1}

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1** is analyzing an entire page. This means they're looking at a larger sample size of words, increasing the likelihood of encountering a page where the average word length is 6 or more.
* **Investigator 2** is only looking at the first line of each page.  This is a much smaller sample size, making it less likely to find a line with an average word length of 6 or more.

While it's impossible to be absolutely certain without knowing the specific text, it's more probable that Investigator 1 would find more pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
