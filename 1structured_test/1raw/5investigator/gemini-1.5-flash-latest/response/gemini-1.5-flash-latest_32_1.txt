{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages:**  Pages are likely to have a more balanced distribution of word lengths.  Longer words might be balanced by shorter words, bringing the overall page average closer to the book average.
* **Investigator 2 is looking at single lines:**  A single line is much smaller than a page. It's more likely that a line will have a skewed average due to a single long word or a cluster of longer words. 

Therefore, it's more probable that Investigator 1 will find fewer pages with an average word length of 6 or more, while Investigator 2 will find more lines with that average.
