{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes whole pages:**  A page is likely to have a more consistent word-length distribution compared to a single line.  A page is likely to have both longer and shorter words, averaging out closer to the book's overall average.
* **Investigator 2 analyzes single lines:** A single line can be heavily influenced by one or two long words, making it much easier to reach an average of 6 or more. 

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find fewer instances of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more, making Investigator 2's count likely higher.
