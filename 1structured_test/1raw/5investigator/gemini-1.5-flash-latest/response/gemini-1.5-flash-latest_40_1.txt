{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to appear in longer lines.**  A single long word can significantly inflate the average word length of a line. 
* **Pages are longer than lines.**  A page has multiple lines, meaning there are more opportunities for longer words to be distributed across the page and potentially bring the average word length closer to 4. 

Therefore, Investigator 1, who's considering the entire page, is more likely to find fewer instances where the average word length reaches 6 or more compared to Investigator 2, who's only looking at individual lines.
