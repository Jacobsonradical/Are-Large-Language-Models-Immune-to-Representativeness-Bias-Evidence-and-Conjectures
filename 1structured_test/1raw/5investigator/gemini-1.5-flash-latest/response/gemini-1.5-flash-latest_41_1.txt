{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1:**  Examines the average word length of *entire pages*.  Pages are likely to contain a more diverse range of sentence lengths and word choices, making it more probable to find pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
* **Investigator 2:** Focuses on a single line per page.  A single line is a smaller sample and is more likely to have shorter words, making it less likely to reach an average word length of 6 or more. 

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 recorded a larger number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
