{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes entire pages:** This means they are likely to encounter longer words and more variation in word length, potentially leading to a higher average word length on some pages.
* **Investigator 2 analyzes just one line:** This provides a much smaller sample size for each calculation. It's less likely that a single line will have an average word length of 6 or more, especially compared to an entire page. 

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to record a larger number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
