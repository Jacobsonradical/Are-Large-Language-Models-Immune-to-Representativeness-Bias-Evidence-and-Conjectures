{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes full pages:**  A page likely has a more balanced mix of short and long words. This makes it statistically less likely for a full page to have an average word length of 6 or more compared to a single line.
* **Investigator 2 analyzes individual lines:** A single line is more prone to having a higher average word length. It could consist of a few very long words, easily skewing the average up to 6 or more.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to record a smaller number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more, meaning Investigator 2 will record more units (lines).
