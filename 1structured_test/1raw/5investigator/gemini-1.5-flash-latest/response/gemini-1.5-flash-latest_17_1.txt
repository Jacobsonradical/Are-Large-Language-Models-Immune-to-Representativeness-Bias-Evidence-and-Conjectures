{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 looks at entire pages:** This means they are averaging word lengths over a larger sample of words, making it less likely to get extreme averages like 6 or more.  
* **Investigator 2 looks at single lines:** A single line can have a high average word length if it contains a few very long words. This makes it more likely to find lines with averages of 6 or more. 

Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to record fewer instances of average word length 6 or more compared to Investigator 2.
