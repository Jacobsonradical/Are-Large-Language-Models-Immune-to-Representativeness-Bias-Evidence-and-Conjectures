{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes entire pages:** This means they are considering a larger sample of words per unit (the entire page).
* **Investigator 2 analyzes only the first line:** This is a much smaller sample of words, making it more likely to fluctuate significantly from the overall average.

Since the average word length is 4, it's more probable that a larger sample (like an entire page) will be closer to that average.  Individual lines are more likely to have a higher or lower average word length due to their limited word count.
