{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1's data is more representative:** By analyzing entire pages, Investigator 1 captures the full spectrum of word lengths within a larger chunk of text. This is more likely to reflect the overall average word length of the book.
* **Investigator 2's data is more prone to fluctuation:**  Taking only the first line of each page introduces more variability.  The first line could be unusually short or long compared to the rest of the page.

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume Investigator 1 would find a higher number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
