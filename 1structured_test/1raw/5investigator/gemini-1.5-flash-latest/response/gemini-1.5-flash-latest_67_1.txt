{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes entire pages:** This means they consider a larger amount of text, potentially capturing variations in word length across a wider range of sentence structures and paragraph lengths. 
* **Investigator 2 analyzes only the first line:**  This is a much smaller sample size, making it more likely that they will encounter lines with average word lengths closer to the overall book average (4) or even lower. 

Therefore, it's more probable that Investigator 1, analyzing entire pages, will encounter a larger number of pages with average word lengths of 6 or more.
