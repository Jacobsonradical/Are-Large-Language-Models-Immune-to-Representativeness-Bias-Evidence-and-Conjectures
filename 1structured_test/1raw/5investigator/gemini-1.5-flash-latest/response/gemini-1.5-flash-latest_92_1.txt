{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 (pages):**  By averaging across the entire page, Investigator 1 is likely to encounter more instances of longer words that contribute to a higher average.  A single long word on a page can pull the average up.
* **Investigator 2 (lines):** Lines are shorter. It's less likely that a single long word will significantly impact the average word length of a single line.  Lines with an average word length of 6 or more would need to consist of mostly longer words.

Therefore, it's more probable that Investigator 1 would record a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
