{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are likely to be spread across multiple lines:** If a book has an average word length of 4, there are likely to be some longer words. These longer words are more likely to be split across multiple lines.
* **Investigator 1 captures the entire word:**  Investigator 1's method captures the average word length of the entire page, including any long words that might be split across lines. This gives a more comprehensive view of the word lengths.
* **Investigator 2 only gets a portion:** Investigator 2 only looks at the first line of each page, potentially missing the longer words that are split across lines.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to record a higher number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
