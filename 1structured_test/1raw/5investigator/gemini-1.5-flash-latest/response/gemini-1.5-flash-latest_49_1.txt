{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to appear in longer sentences/lines:**  It's statistically more likely that a page with a higher average word length will also contain a line with a higher average word length.
* **More words per page:**  Since Investigator 1 is averaging across the entire page, which likely contains more words than a single line, they have a larger sample size for each data point. This increases the likelihood that the page average will reflect a higher number of words with a higher average length. 

While we can't say for certain without the book itself, it's reasonable to assume Investigator 1 would count more instances of lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
