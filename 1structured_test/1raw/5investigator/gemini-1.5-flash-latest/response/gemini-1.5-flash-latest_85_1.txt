{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1** is looking at the average word length across *entire pages*. This means they are considering a larger sample of words, making it less likely for a page to have a significantly high average word length (6 or more).
* **Investigator 2** is looking at the average word length of just *one line* per page. A single line can have a much higher average word length due to longer words or fewer words in the line. This makes it more likely for Investigator 2 to find lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
