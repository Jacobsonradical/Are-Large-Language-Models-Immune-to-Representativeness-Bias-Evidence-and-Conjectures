{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes whole pages:** This means they are taking into account the word lengths of all words on the page. Longer words are more likely to occur in the body of a paragraph than just the first line.
* **Investigator 2 only looks at the first line:** First lines often have shorter words to start a sentence, set the scene, or introduce a topic. 

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 will find a higher number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more, since they are looking at more words overall.
