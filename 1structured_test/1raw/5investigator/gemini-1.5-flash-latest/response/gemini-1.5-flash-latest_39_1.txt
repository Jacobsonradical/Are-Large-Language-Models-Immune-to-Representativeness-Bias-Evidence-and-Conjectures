{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages:** This means they're averaging word lengths over a much larger sample size than Investigator 2.
* **Investigator 2 is looking at single lines:**  While lines can have outliers (very long or short words), they are generally much shorter than a full page.  
* **Fluctuation:** The average word length of a page is likely to be closer to the book's overall average (4) than the average word length of a single line. This means Investigator 1 is less likely to encounter pages with an average of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 2 encountering lines with that average. 

Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to have a lower count of pages with an average word length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 2's count of lines.
