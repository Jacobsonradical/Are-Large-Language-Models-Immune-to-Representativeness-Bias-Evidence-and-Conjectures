{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words tend to be less frequent:**  Longer words are generally less common than shorter words.  
* **Investigator 1 averages across the entire page:** This means that even if a page has a few very long words, those long words are balanced out by the more frequent shorter words.
* **Investigator 2 focuses on a single line:** A single line is more susceptible to having an average word length of 6 or more if it happens to contain a few longer words. 

Therefore, Investigator 1, averaging over entire pages, is likely to encounter fewer instances of an average word length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 2, who is focusing on individual lines.
