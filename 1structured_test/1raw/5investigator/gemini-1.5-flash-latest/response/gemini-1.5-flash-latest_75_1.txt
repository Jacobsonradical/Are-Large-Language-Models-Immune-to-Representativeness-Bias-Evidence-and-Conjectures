{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes entire pages:** This means their data is influenced by the variation in word length across the whole page. It's more likely to have pages with a higher average word length due to the presence of longer words or fewer short words. 
* **Investigator 2 analyzes single lines:**  Lines are much shorter units.  It's less likely that a single line will have a consistently high average word length compared to a whole page. 

Therefore, it's more probable that Investigator 1 will find a larger number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
