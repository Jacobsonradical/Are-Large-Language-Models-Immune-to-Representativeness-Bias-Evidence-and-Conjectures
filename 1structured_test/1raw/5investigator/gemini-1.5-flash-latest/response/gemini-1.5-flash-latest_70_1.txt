{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer Words:**  Longer words are more likely to push the average word length up.  
* **Investigator 1's Method:**  Investigator 1 is considering the entire page, which is likely to include a wider variety of word lengths, including potentially longer words.
* **Investigator 2's Method:** Investigator 2 only considers a single line, which is more likely to have a smaller variation in word length.

Therefore, it's more probable that Investigator 1 will find a larger number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
