{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1** is analyzing the entire page. This means they're considering a larger sample of words compared to Investigator 2, who only looks at the first line.
* **Longer words are less frequent:** The average word length of 4 indicates that shorter words are more common.  
* **Longer lines are more likely to have longer words:** Longer lines have a higher chance of including longer words, which will skew the average word length higher. 

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1, analyzing entire pages, will find a higher number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
