{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 considers entire pages:** This means they are averaging word length across many more words than Investigator 2.
* **Longer words are more likely to influence the average:**  A single long word can significantly raise the average word length of a line or page.  
* **Investigator 2 is limited to single lines:**  A line with a long word is more likely to have an average of 6 or more, but since they are only looking at one line at a time, they are less likely to find as many instances compared to Investigator 1.

**In conclusion:**  It's highly likely that Investigator 1, who is looking at the average word length of entire pages, will find more instances of a 6 or higher average compared to Investigator 2, who is only analyzing single lines.
