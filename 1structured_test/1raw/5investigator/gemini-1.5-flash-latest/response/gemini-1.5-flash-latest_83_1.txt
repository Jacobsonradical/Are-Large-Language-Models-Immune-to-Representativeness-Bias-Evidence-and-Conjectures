{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1** is analyzing entire pages.  A single page can contain many words, increasing the chance of having an average word length of 6 or more, even if a few longer words skew the average.
* **Investigator 2** is looking at single lines.  A line is likely to have fewer words, making it less likely to have a high enough average word length to reach 6 or more. 

Therefore, it's more probable that Investigator 1 will record a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
