{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1** analyzes the entire page, which likely contains multiple sentences and a variety of word lengths. This means it's more likely to have a distribution of word lengths that might include a greater number of longer words, leading to more pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
* **Investigator 2** focuses on a single line, which is likely to have fewer words and less variation in word length.  Therefore, it's less likely to have an average word length of 6 or more compared to an entire page. 

While it's impossible to be certain without the actual data, it's reasonable to assume that Investigator 1 would record a larger number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
