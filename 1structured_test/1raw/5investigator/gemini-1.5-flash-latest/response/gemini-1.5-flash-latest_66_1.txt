{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes entire pages:**  The average word length across a whole page is likely to be more consistent with the overall book average (4) than the average of a single line. 
* **Investigator 2 analyzes single lines:** A single line can have a much higher or lower average word length due to the presence of long or short words.  It's more probable to find a line with an average of 6 or more than a whole page with that average.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to record a larger number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
