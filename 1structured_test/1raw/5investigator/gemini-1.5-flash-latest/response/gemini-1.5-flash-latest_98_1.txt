{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes entire pages:**  This means they are taking into account the variability of word lengths across a larger chunk of text. Longer words and shorter words within a page can balance each other out.
* **Investigator 2 analyzes single lines:**  Single lines are much smaller units.  It's more likely that a single line will have a higher average word length if it happens to include a few longer words.

**Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 will find more units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more because they are working with a larger sample size.**
