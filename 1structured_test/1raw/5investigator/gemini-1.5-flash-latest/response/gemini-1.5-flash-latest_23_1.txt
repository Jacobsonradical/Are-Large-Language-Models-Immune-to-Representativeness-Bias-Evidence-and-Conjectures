{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1's data is more representative:**  Investigator 1 considers the average word length of the entire page. This takes into account the variability in word length throughout the page, making it a more comprehensive measure.
* **Investigator 2's data is more prone to outliers:**  Investigator 2 only considers a single line per page. A single line can have an unusually high average word length due to a few long words, even if the rest of the page has shorter words. This makes their count more sensitive to outliers.

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 will record a larger number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more because their data is more reflective of the overall word length distribution in the book.
