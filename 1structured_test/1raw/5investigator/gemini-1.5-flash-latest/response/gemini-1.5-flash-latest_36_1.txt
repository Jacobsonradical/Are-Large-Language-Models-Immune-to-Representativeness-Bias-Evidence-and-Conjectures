{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page:** This means they are averaging the word lengths of a significantly larger number of words. 
* **Investigator 2 is looking at a single line:** This means they are averaging a much smaller number of words.

It's more likely that a larger sample (the whole page) will have more variation in word lengths, making it easier to reach an average of 6 or more.  The smaller sample size of a single line makes it less likely to contain enough longer words to achieve an average of 6 or more.
