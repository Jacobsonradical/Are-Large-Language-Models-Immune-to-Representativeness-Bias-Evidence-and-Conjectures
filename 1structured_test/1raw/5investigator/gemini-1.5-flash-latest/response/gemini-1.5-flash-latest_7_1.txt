{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to be spread across multiple lines.**  A very long word is more likely to be split across a line break than a shorter word. This means that a page with many long words will likely have a higher average word length than a line taken from that same page.
* **Investigator 1's data is more likely to capture these longer words.** Because Investigator 1 is considering the average word length of the *entire* page, the impact of longer words is averaged over all the words on that page. Investigator 2 only sees the impact of the long word if it happens to be entirely within the first line of the page.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find a higher number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
