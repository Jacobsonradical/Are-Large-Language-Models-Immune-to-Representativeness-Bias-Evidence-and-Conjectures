{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is analyzing entire pages:** This means they are considering a larger sample of words in each unit. 
* **Investigator 2 is analyzing only the first line:** This is a much smaller sample of words.

Since the average word length of the entire book is 4, it's more likely that a larger sample of words (like an entire page) will have a higher average word length of 6 or more compared to a single line.
