{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at a larger sample:**  Each page likely contains multiple lines. This means Investigator 1 is averaging over more words per unit of measurement.
* **Distribution of word lengths:** It's more likely to have a few longer words spread out across a whole page, raising the overall page average to 6 or more. A single line is less likely to have enough long words to reach that average. 

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find a larger number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
