{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer Words in a Line:**  A single line with a high average word length is more likely to occur than a whole page with a high average word length. This is because a few long words can significantly raise the average for a line. 
* **Page Averages:**  A page's average word length is influenced by all the words on that page. It's less likely to be drastically skewed by a few long words because those long words are distributed across multiple lines.

Therefore, Investigator 1, who is analyzing entire pages, is more likely to find fewer instances where the average word length reaches 6 or more compared to Investigator 2, who is analyzing individual lines.
