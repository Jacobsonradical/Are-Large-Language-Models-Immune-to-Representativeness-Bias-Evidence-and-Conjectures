{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1** is analyzing entire pages, which likely contain a larger variety of sentence structures and word lengths. This means there's a higher chance of encountering a page with an average word length of 6 or more.
* **Investigator 2** is focusing on the first line of each page, which are more likely to be shorter and contain fewer words.  Since the average word length of the entire book is 4, it's less probable for a single line to have an average word length of 6 or more. 

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find a larger number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
