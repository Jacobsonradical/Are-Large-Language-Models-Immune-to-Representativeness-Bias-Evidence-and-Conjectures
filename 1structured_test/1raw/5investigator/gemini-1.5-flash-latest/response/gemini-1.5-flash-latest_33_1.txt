{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to be spread across multiple lines.**  If a page has a long word like "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", it will likely span multiple lines. This means Investigator 2 would only count the average word length of the portion of the word appearing on each line, which would likely be shorter.  
* **Investigator 1 captures the full impact of long words.**  By averaging the entire page, Investigator 1 gets a more accurate representation of the impact of any long words, making it more likely they'll find pages with a higher average word length. 

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to record a larger number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
