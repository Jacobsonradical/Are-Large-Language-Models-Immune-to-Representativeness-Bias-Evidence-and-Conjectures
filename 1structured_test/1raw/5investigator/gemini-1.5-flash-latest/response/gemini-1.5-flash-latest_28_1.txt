{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1's method is more representative:**  Investigator 1 considers the average word length across the entire page. This means they are capturing the overall word length variation within each page, not just the first line.
* **Lines can be more variable:** Investigator 2 only looks at the first line, which might not accurately reflect the word length of the rest of the page.  First lines might be longer or shorter for a variety of reasons (e.g., starting a new paragraph, a quote, etc.)

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find more pages with an average word length of 6 or more because they are considering more data points (the entire page).
