{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 (pages):**  They are analyzing the average word length of the entire page.  Since the book's overall average is 4, pages with an average of 6 or more will likely have a significant number of longer words to skew the average upward. 
* **Investigator 2 (lines):** They are analyzing a single line. A single line with an average of 6 or more is less likely because it's easier for a longer word to drag the overall page average up than just a single line.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to record more units with an average word length of 6 or more.
