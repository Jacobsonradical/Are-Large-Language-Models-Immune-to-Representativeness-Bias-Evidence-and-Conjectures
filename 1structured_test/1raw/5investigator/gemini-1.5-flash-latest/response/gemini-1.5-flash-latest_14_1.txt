{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page:** This means they are averaging over potentially many more words, making it less likely to have an average word length of 6 or more.
* **Investigator 2 is looking at a single line:**  Single lines are much shorter.  It's easier for a few longer words in a short line to significantly bump up the average word length.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to find fewer instances of an average word length of 6 or more.
