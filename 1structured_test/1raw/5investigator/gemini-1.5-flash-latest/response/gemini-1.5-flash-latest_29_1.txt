{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 (pages):**  Investigator 1 is looking at the average word length across a whole page.  This means they're taking into account the word length variation within the entire page. It's more likely that a page will have some longer words and some shorter words, averaging out to 6 or more. 

* **Investigator 2 (lines):** Investigator 2 is only looking at the average word length of a single line. A single line is much shorter, and therefore, there's a lower chance of having enough long words to pull the average up to 6 or more.  

**In summary:**  It's more likely that a full page will have enough longer words to raise the average word length to 6 or more, compared to a single line.
