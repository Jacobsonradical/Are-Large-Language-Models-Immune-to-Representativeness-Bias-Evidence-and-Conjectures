{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page:**  This means they're considering a larger sample of words, making it more likely to encounter pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
* **Investigator 2 is focusing on a single line:** This is a much smaller sample.  While some lines might have a high average word length, it's less likely to consistently occur across all lines on a page compared to the entire page's average.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to record a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
