{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to appear in the body of a page.**  A page's average word length is influenced by all the words on that page. It's more probable that longer words (contributing to a higher average) would occur within the text of the page rather than solely in the first line.
* **First lines often have shorter words.**  First lines tend to contain articles, prepositions, and other short words to introduce the topic. This makes it less likely for a first line to have an average word length of 6 or more.

Therefore, Investigator 1, who considered the entire page, is more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
