{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to occur in longer lines:**  A line with many short words is unlikely to have an average word length of 6 or more.  Longer lines are more likely to contain a few longer words, pushing the average up. 
* **Investigator 1 has a larger sample size:**  Investigator 1 is analyzing the average word length across entire pages, which will contain many lines.  Investigator 2 is only looking at one line per page.  

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1, with their larger sample size and the inherent likelihood of longer lines containing more longer words, would find more instances of an average word length of 6 or more.
