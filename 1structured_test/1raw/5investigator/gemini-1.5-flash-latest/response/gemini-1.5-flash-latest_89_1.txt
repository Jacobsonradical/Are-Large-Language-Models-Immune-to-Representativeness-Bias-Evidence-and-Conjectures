{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is analyzing entire pages:** This means they're considering a larger sample of words per unit (page) compared to Investigator 2.
* **Investigator 2 is analyzing single lines:** Lines are generally shorter than pages, leading to a smaller sample of words per unit (line).

Since Investigator 1 is working with a larger sample size, it's more likely they will encounter units (pages) with a higher average word length of 6 or more.
