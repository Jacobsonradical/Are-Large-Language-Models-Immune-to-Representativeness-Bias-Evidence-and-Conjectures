{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes entire pages:** This means they are considering a larger chunk of text, potentially including sentences with longer words and variations in word length. 
* **Investigator 2 focuses on single lines:**  First lines are likely to be more concise and focused, potentially containing shorter words and fewer variations in word length.

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 will encounter more instances of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
