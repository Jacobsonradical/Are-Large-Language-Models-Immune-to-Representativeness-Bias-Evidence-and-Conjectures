{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are likely to occur in longer lines:**  It's more probable that a line containing several long words would have an average word length of 6 or more.
* **Investigator 1 considers the entire page:** Investigator 1's average word length calculation takes into account all the words on the page, making it more likely to capture pages with a higher average. Even if a page has a few short lines, a few longer lines could significantly impact the overall average.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to count a higher number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
