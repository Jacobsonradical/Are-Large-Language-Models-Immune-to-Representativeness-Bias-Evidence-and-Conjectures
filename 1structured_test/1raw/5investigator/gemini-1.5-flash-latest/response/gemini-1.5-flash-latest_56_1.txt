{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page:**  They are calculating the average word length across all words on the page. This means a single long word can significantly influence the average for the whole page.
* **Investigator 2 is focused on a single line:** They only look at the average word length of the first line. It's less likely for a single long word to drastically skew the average of just one line.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to encounter pages with an average word length of 6 or more, as they are considering more words in their calculation.
