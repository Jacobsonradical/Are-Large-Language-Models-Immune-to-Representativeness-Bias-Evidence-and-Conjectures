{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to occur in full pages.** A single long word can significantly skew the average word length of a line. It's more likely that a full page will contain a distribution of word lengths that balances out the effect of a few long words. 
* **Investigator 1 has a larger sample size.**  They are analyzing entire pages, which will contain more words than just the first line of each page.  This larger sample size makes it more likely they'll encounter pages with an average word length of 6 or more. 

Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
