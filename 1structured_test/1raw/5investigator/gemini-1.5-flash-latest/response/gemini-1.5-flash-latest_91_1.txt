{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is analyzing the entire page:** This means they're considering a larger sample of words per "unit" (the page) compared to Investigator 2, who is only looking at a single line.
* **Longer words are more likely to skew the average:**  Longer words have a more significant impact on the average word length.  Since Investigator 1 is looking at more words per unit, it's more likely that a few longer words will pull the average up to 6 or more within a page.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to find a larger number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
