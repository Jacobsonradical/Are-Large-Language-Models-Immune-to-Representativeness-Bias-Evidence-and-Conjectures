{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is analyzing the entire page.**  This means they are taking into account more words, which increases the chance of finding a higher average word length. 
* **Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line.** This means they are working with a much smaller sample of words, making it less likely to encounter a page with an average word length of 6 or more.

Since Investigator 1 has a larger sample size, they are more likely to encounter pages with a higher average word length.
