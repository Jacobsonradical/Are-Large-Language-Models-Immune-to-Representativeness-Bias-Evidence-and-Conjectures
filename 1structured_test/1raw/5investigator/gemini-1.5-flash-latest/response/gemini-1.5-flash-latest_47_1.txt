{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to be spread across multiple lines:**  A very long word, exceeding the average length, is more likely to be split across two lines. This means that while Investigator 1 would count that word as contributing to the long average for the entire page, Investigator 2 would only count its partial contribution on the first line. 
* **Single long words can skew a page average:** Investigator 1's average is based on all the words on a page. A single very long word (like "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious") could be enough to push a page's average word length above 6, even if most other words on the page are short.  Investigator 2, however, would only see a portion of that word on a single line, making it less likely to drive the line average above 6.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to have counted a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
