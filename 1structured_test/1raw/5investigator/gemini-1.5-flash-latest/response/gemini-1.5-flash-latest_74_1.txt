{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages:** This means they are averaging over a larger number of words, making it less likely to get a very high average word length by chance.
* **Investigator 2 is looking at single lines:**  Single lines are much more prone to having high average word lengths due to a few long words.  A single long word in a line can skew the average significantly.

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 will find fewer pages with an average word length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 2 finding lines with that same average.
