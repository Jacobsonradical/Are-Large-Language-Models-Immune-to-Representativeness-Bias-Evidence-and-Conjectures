{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1's data is more representative:** Investigator 1 considers the entire page, giving a broader picture of the average word length. This is a more accurate reflection of the overall language structure.
* **Lines are more variable:** Investigator 2 only looks at the first line of each page. First lines are often shorter or longer than the rest of the page due to sentence structure or formatting (e.g., a title). This makes it more likely to find lines with significantly higher or lower word lengths, skewing the count of lines with an average of 6 or more.

**In conclusion:** Investigator 1, by considering the whole page, is likely to encounter fewer pages with average word lengths of 6 or more, as the overall average is 4.
