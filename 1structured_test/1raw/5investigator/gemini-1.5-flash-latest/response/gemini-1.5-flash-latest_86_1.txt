{investigator: 1}

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at the average word length across the entire page.**  This means even if a few long words are present, the average for the whole page might be pulled up to 6 or more.
* **Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page.**  A single line is much less likely to have enough long words to push the average to 6 or more compared to an entire page.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find a larger number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
