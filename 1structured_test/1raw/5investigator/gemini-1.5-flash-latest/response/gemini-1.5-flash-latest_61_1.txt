{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to appear in longer lines:** It's natural for longer words to occur in lines with more words. This means Investigator 2 is more likely to encounter a line with a high average word length due to the inclusion of a single long word.
* **Investigator 1 considers the entire page:** Investigator 1's average is calculated across the entire page, which is a much larger sample than just one line. This makes it less likely for a few long words to drastically skew the average word length for the entire page.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find fewer pages with an average word length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 2 finding lines with that average.
