{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 uses more data:**  Investigator 1 considers all words on a page to calculate the average word length. This means they're looking at a significantly larger sample size than Investigator 2, who only examines the first line of each page.
* **Fluctuations in average word length:**  It's highly likely that a single line will have a more extreme average word length compared to the average of a whole page.  Longer words are more likely to appear within a page, averaging out the effect of shorter words. 

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find a higher number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
