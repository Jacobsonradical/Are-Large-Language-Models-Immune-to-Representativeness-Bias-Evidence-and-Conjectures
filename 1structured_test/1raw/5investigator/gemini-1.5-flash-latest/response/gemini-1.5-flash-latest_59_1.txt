{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes entire pages:** This means they are looking at a larger sample of words per unit of analysis (the page).  Longer words and shorter words within a page will average out.
* **Investigator 2 analyzes single lines:**  This means they are looking at a much smaller sample of words per unit of analysis (the line). It's more likely that a single line will have a significantly higher average word length due to the presence of a few long words, even if the overall book average is 4.

**Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to have a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.**  The larger sample size of words per page makes it more likely that the average will be closer to the overall book average.
