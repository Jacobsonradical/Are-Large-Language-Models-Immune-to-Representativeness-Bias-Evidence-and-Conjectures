{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to be in longer lines.**  While a single long word can skew a page's average up, it's more likely to be part of a longer line with other words.
* **Investigator 1 looks at all words on a page.**  This means they have more data points to potentially contribute to a higher average.
* **Investigator 2 only looks at the first line.** This gives them a smaller sample size, making it less likely they'll encounter enough long words to push the average to 6 or more.

While it's possible for Investigator 2 to find some lines with an average of 6 or more, it's statistically less likely compared to Investigator 1 finding a larger number of pages with an average of 6 or more.
