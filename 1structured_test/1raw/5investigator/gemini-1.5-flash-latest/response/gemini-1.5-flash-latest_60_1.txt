{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to appear in full sentences:**  Lines typically represent full sentences or fragments of sentences, while pages contain a mix of sentences and other elements like headings, paragraphs, and even blank space. 
* **The average word length of a full sentence is likely to be higher:**  Full sentences tend to contain more content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) which are generally longer than function words (prepositions, articles, etc.).
* **Investigator 2 focuses on sentences:** Investigator 2 only looks at first lines, which are more likely to contain full sentences, increasing the chance of encountering longer words and thus higher average word lengths. 

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume Investigator 1, who considers the entire page, will likely encounter fewer instances of a 6 or higher average word length compared to Investigator 2.
