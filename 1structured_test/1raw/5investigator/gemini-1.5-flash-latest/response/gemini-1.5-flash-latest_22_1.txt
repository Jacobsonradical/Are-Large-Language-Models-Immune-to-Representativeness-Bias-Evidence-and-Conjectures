{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1's data is likely to be more consistent:**  They are analyzing the average word length of entire pages.  While a page might have a few very long words, it's more likely that the overall average will be closer to the book's average of 4.
* **Investigator 2's data is likely to be more variable:** They are analyzing the average word length of single lines.  It's much easier for a single line to have a high average word length due to the presence of a few long words. This makes it more likely that they will find more lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
