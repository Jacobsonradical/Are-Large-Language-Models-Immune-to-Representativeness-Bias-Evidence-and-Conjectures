{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 (pages):**  They are looking at the average word length across *entire pages*. This means they are averaging a larger number of words, making it less likely to have a single page with an average word length of 6 or more. 
* **Investigator 2 (lines):**  They are looking at the average word length of just *one line*.  A single line can have a much higher average word length (like a long sentence) compared to the overall average of the book.

Therefore, it's more likely Investigator 2 (looking at lines) will find a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
