{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1's data is more representative:**  They calculated the average word length across the entire page. This captures the overall word length variation within each page, making it more likely to find pages with a higher average word length.
* **Investigator 2's data is more limited:** They only looked at the first line of each page. This is a small sample of the page's content and might not accurately reflect the average word length for the entire page.

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume Investigator 1 would find more pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
