{investigator: 1}

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1** is examining the average word length of the *entire page*. This means they are taking into account all the words on the page, making it more likely to find pages with a higher average word length (6 or more).
* **Investigator 2** is only examining the first line of each page.  This is a smaller sample of words, making it less likely to encounter lines with a high average word length.

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume Investigator 1 would record a larger number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
