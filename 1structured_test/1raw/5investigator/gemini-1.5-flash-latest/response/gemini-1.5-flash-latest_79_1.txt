{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes the entire page:**  This gives them a more representative sample of word lengths.  The average word length across an entire page is likely to be closer to the overall book average (4) than the average of a single line.
* **Investigator 2 focuses on a single line:** A single line is a much smaller sample size.  It's more susceptible to variations in word length that might not be representative of the entire page.  

**Therefore, it's likely that Investigator 1 will find a larger number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.**  It's less likely that a single line would have such a high average, especially since the overall average is 4.
