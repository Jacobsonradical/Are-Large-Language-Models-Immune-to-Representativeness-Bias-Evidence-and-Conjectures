{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to appear in longer lines.**  A single long word will significantly increase the average word length of a line.
* **Lines tend to be shorter than pages.**  Since a longer line has more opportunities to include longer words, the average word length of a page is more likely to be closer to the book's overall average.

Therefore, Investigator 1, who looked at entire pages, is more likely to find a larger number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
