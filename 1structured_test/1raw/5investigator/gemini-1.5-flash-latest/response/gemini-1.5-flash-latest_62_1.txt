{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 looks at the whole page:** This means they are considering the distribution of word lengths across the entire page.  It's more likely that a longer word on a page will be balanced out by shorter words, resulting in a lower overall page average.
* **Investigator 2 only looks at the first line:** The first line might have a higher chance of containing longer words (perhaps titles, introductory phrases) compared to the rest of the page.  This makes it more likely that a first line will have an average word length of 6 or more compared to a whole page.

**Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.**
