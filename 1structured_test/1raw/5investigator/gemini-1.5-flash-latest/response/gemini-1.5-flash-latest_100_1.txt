{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1's data is more representative:**  They are averaging word lengths across an entire page, which is a larger sample of text than just a single line.  
* **Lines are likely to be shorter:** The first line of a page might be shorter than the average line due to formatting (e.g., starting a new chapter, a short introductory sentence) or style. This means Investigator 2 is more likely to find lines with shorter average word lengths.
* **Overall book average:**  The fact that the average word length of the entire book is 4 suggests that many pages likely have average word lengths close to that.  It's less likely that a large number of pages would have an average of 6 or more. 

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 recorded a larger number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
