{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1's Data:** Investigator 1 considers the entire page.  It's more likely that a longer word will be present on a page, thus increasing the overall average word length of that page to 6 or more.
* **Investigator 2's Data:** Investigator 2 only considers the first line of each page.  This greatly reduces the chances of encountering enough long words to push the average word length of that line to 6 or more.

**In conclusion, Investigator 1 is more likely to record a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.**
