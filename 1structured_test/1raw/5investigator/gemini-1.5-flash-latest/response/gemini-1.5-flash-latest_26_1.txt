{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 considers the entire page:**  They calculate the average word length across all words on the page. This means there's a higher probability of finding pages with a higher average word length, especially if the book contains longer words or sentences.
* **Investigator 2 focuses on a single line:** They only consider the first line of each page. This makes it less likely to find lines with a high average word length, as a single line is less likely to have consistently longer words than an entire page. 

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find a larger number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
