{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page:**  They are averaging all the words on a page. This means they are more likely to encounter longer words and phrases that will push the average higher. 
* **Investigator 2 is looking at a single line:** A single line is more likely to have shorter words. It's less likely to include the longer words and phrases that would contribute to an average of 6 or more.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find a larger number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
