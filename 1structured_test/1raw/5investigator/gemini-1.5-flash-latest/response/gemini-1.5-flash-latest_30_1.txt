{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page.**  A single page can have a higher average word length due to a few very long words, even if the overall book average is 4. 
* **Investigator 2 is looking at just one line.**  It's much less likely for a single line to have a significantly higher average word length than the book average.  A single line with a few long words would have a greater impact on the line's average than on the page's average. 

Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to find more instances of a 6 or higher average word length.
