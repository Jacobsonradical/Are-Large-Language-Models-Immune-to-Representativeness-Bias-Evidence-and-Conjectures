{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at the average word length of the entire page.** This means they are considering the combined effect of all the words on the page, including potentially longer words and shorter words.
* **Investigator 2 is looking at the average word length of a single line.**  This is a smaller sample size, and it's more likely that a single line will have a higher average word length than the whole page simply due to the presence of one or two longer words. 

Since Investigator 1 is looking at a larger sample size (the entire page), it's more likely they'll find more pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
