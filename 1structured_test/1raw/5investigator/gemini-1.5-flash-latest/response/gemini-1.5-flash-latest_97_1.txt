{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to appear in the middle of a page.**  Sentences tend to have a variety of word lengths, and longer words are less likely to be used in the first line of a paragraph.
* **Investigator 1 considers all words on a page.** This gives them a larger sample size, and a better chance of encountering more words that contribute to a high average word-length.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find a higher number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
