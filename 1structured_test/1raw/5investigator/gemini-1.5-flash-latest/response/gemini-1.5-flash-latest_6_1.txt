{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 considers the entire page:**  They analyze the average word length across all words on the page. This means they have a larger sample size for each calculation.
* **Investigator 2 only considers the first line:** This is a significantly smaller sample size.

Since the overall average word length of the book is 4, it's more likely that individual pages will have a closer average to 4 than individual lines. Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find more instances of a page averaging 6 or more words.
