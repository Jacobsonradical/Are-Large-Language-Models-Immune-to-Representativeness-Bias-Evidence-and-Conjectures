{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Longer words are more likely to occur in full pages:**  A single long word can drastically skew the average word length of a line.  However, across a whole page, the effect of one long word is diluted by the presence of many other words.
* **Pages have more words:**  A single line is likely to have fewer words than an entire page. This means there are more opportunities for longer words to occur and influence the average on a full page.

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 (analyzing entire pages) would find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
