{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1's method is more likely to capture longer words:** By analyzing the average word length across an entire page, Investigator 1 is more likely to encounter pages with a higher average word length. A single long word on a page can skew the average upward.
* **Investigator 2's method is more susceptible to variation:**  Analyzing only the first line of each page means Investigator 2's results are more prone to fluctuation based on the length of the first line's words.  A short first line with mostly short words might have a low average, even if the page itself contains longer words later on. 

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to record a larger number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
