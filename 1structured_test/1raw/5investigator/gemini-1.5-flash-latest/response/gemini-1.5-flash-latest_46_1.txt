{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes entire pages:**  This means their average word-length calculations are based on a larger sample of words.
* **Investigator 2 analyzes single lines:** A single line is likely to have fewer words, making it more susceptible to fluctuations in word length.
* **The average word-length is 4:**  This means a line with 6 or more average word-length is significantly longer than average.  It's statistically less likely to find many such lines than pages with that average.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
