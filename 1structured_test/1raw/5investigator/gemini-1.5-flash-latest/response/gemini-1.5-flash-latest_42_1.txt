{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes the entire page:**  This means they are considering all words on the page, giving them a larger sample size for each calculation. 
* **Investigator 2 analyzes only the first line:** This means they have a much smaller sample size for each calculation, making it more likely that a single long word or a string of short words could drastically affect the average.

It's more probable that a single line will have a significantly higher average word length than 6 compared to a whole page. Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to have a larger number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
