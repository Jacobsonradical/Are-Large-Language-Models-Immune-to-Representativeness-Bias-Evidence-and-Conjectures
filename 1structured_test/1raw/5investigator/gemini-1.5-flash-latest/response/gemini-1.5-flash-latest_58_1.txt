{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page:** This means they are averaging more words, increasing the likelihood of encountering longer words that push the average up to 6 or more. 
* **Investigator 2 is looking at a single line:**  While a line might have a few long words, it's much easier for a single line to have a lower average word length compared to an entire page.

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 will encounter more instances of an average word-length of 6 or more.
