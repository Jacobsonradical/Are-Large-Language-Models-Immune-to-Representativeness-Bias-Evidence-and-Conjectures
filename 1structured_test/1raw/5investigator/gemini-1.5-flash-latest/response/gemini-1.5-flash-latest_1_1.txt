{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page:** This means they have more words to average, making it less likely for a page to have a high average word length of 6 or more.
* **Investigator 2 is looking at a single line:**  A single line can have a high average word length due to a few long words, even if the page overall has an average of 4.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to have a lower count of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more, while Investigator 2 is more likely to have a higher count of units (lines) with a high average word length.
