{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is analyzing full pages:** This means they have a larger sample size of words to calculate the average from.  
* **Investigator 2 is only analyzing the first line of each page:**  This is a much smaller sample size. 

Since the average word length for the entire book is 4, it's more likely that a full page will have a closer average to that number than a single line.  This makes it less likely that a single line will have an average word length of 6 or more compared to a full page.
