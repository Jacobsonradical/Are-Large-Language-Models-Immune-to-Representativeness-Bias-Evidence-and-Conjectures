{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is examining the entire page:** This means they are averaging word length over a larger sample of words.
* **Investigator 2 is examining just one line:** This is a smaller sample of words.

**Therefore, it's more likely that a single line will deviate from the overall average word length than an entire page.**  A few long words on a single line could drastically raise its average word length, whereas the larger sample size of a whole page would tend to even out fluctuations.
