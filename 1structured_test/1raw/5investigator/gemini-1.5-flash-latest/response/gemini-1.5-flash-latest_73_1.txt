{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages:** This means they are averaging a larger sample of words. It's more likely that the average word length across an entire page will be closer to the overall book average (4) than a single line.
* **Investigator 2 is looking at individual lines:**  Lines are much shorter, and a single line can be influenced by a few very long or very short words, making it much easier to have a significant deviation from the overall book average.

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 will find more pages with an average word length of 6 or more than Investigator 2 will find lines with that average.
