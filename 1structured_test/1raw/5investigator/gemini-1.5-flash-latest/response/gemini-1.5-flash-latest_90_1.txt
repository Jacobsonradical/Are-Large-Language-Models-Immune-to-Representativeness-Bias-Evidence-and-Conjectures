{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1** is looking at the average word length of *entire pages*.  This means they are averaging a larger number of words, making it less likely to have significant fluctuations in word length.
* **Investigator 2** is looking at the average word length of *single lines*.  This means their average is based on a much smaller sample of words, making it more likely to have a higher variation in word length.

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 will find a larger number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
