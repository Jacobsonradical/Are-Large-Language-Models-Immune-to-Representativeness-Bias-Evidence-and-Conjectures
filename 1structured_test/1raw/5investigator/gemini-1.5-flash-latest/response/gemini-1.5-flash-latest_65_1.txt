{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages:**  A page is likely to have a wider variety of word lengths, both short and long, compared to a single line. This averaging effect makes it more probable that a page will have an average word length of 6 or more.
* **Investigator 2 is looking at single lines:** A single line is less likely to contain a mix of very long and very short words that would push the average up to 6.  

Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find a larger number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
