{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes entire pages:** This means they consider a larger sample of words, potentially including longer words that might occur within a sentence but not necessarily at the start of a line.
* **Investigator 2 analyzes only the first line:**  While they might capture some long words, they're limited to the words that start sentences.  

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 would find a larger number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
