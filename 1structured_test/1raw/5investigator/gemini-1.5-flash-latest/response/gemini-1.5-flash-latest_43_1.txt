{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 looks at the entire page:**  This means they are taking into account all the words on the page, including longer words that might appear in the middle of the page.
* **Investigator 2 looks only at the first line:** This means they are more likely to encounter shorter words, as first lines often have shorter phrases to introduce the topic of the page. 

Since Investigator 1 is considering more words on each page, they are more likely to encounter pages with a higher average word-length, including those exceeding 6.
