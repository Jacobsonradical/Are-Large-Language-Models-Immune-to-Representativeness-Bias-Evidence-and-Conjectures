{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1** is averaging word length over an entire page. This means they are likely to encounter more longer words and shorter words, averaging out to a value closer to the book's overall average of 4.
* **Investigator 2** is only looking at a single line per page. This makes them much more susceptible to variations. A single line could have a few very long words, skewing the average to 6 or more, even if the page as a whole doesn't.

Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to find fewer instances of a 6 or higher average compared to Investigator 2.
