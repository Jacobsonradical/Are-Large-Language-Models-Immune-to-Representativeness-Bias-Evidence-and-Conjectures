{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 considers the whole page:**  The average word length of a page is likely to be more consistent with the overall book average (4) because it's calculated from many more words. 
* **Investigator 2 considers a single line:**  A single line can have a much more variable word length, especially if it's a sentence with a few long words or a short sentence with very short words. 

Therefore, it's more likely that a page will have a word-length average closer to 6 than a single line. This means Investigator 1 is more likely to record a larger number of units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more.
