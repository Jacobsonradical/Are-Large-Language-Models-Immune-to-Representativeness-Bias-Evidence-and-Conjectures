{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 analyzes entire pages:**  By analyzing the entire page, Investigator 1 is likely to encounter more long words and therefore pages with higher average word lengths. 
* **Investigator 2 focuses on single lines:**  A single line is much smaller than an entire page. It's less likely to contain enough long words to push the average to 6 or more.

This suggests Investigator 1 would find a greater number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
