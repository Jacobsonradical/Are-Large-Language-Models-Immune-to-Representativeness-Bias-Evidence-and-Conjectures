{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Investigator 1 considers the entire page:**  The average word length of a page is likely to be more stable than the average word length of a single line. A page has many words, making it less susceptible to outliers or short words that skew the average.
* **Investigator 2 considers a single line:** A single line can have a much wider variation in word length. One long word or a series of short words can drastically affect the average.

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 1 will find more pages with an average word length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 2 finding lines with that average.
