{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means there's a greater chance for a line to have a few long words by random chance, pushing its average word length up.  Pages, being longer, are more likely to balance out long and short words, making it harder to reach an average of 6 or more.

* **Think of Extremes:** Imagine a page with mostly short words, but one line contains "hippopotamus" and "extraterrestrial".  That line's average word length will be very high, even if the page average remains closer to the book's overall average of 4.

While Investigator 1 might find some pages with a high average word length, Investigator 2 is much more likely to find numerous lines that meet the criteria simply due to the increased variability within shorter units of text.
