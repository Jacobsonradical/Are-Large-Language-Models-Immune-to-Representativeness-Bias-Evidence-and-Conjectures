{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length.  A single long word in a short line can dramatically skew the average. 
* **Higher chance of extremes:** Since Investigator 2 is dealing with these shorter units, there's a higher probability of finding lines with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the overall book average is 4. 

Think of it like this: it's much easier to randomly pick a handful of tall people if you're choosing from a small group. Investigator 2 is essentially looking at "handfuls" of words, while Investigator 1 is examining larger groups.
