Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages.  With fewer words, the average word length in a line is more susceptible to fluctuations.  A single long word can dramatically increase the average word length of a line. 
* **Overall Average:** Since the average word length of the book is 4, it's more likely for lines to have an average of 6 or more due to this higher variability. Pages, with many words, are more likely to average closer to the overall book average.
