{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a short line.
* **Higher probability of extremes:** Because of this volatility, Investigator 2 is more likely to find lines with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the overall average is 4. 

Imagine a page with one line containing the word "extraordinary" and the rest of the line filled with short words. That line's average word length would be very high, even if the rest of the page is closer to the average.
