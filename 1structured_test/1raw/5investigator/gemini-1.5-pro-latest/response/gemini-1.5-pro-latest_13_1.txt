{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines, being much shorter units of text than pages, are more likely to have extreme variations in average word length. Imagine a line with just two words â€“ it's easier for those two words to be very long or very short.
* **Higher chance of exceeding the average:** Since the overall average word length is 4, a line only needs a couple of longer words to push its average above 6. Pages, with many more words, are less likely to be drastically skewed by a few long words.

Therefore, Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
