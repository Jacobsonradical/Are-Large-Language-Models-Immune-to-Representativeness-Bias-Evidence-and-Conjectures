{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages.  This means they are more likely to have extreme variations in average word length. 
* **Higher chance of outliers:** A single long word can dramatically skew the average word length of a line. Pages, being longer, are more likely to balance out the presence of a few long or short words.

Since Investigator 2 is looking at lines, which are more prone to these fluctuations, they are more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the overall book average is 4.
