{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:** Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically increase a line's average, while it has a much smaller effect on a page's average. 

* **Higher likelihood of extremes:**  Since Investigator 2 is dealing with shorter units (lines), there's a higher chance of randomly getting lines with several long words in a row, pushing the average above 6. 

* **Overall Book Average:**  The fact that the book's average word length is 4 suggests that longer words are balanced out by shorter words. However, this balance is more likely to be reflected in larger units of text (pages) than in smaller units (lines).
