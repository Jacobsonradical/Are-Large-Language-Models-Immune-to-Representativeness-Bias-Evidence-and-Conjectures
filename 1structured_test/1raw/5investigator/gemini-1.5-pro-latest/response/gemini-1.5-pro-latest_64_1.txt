{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages.  This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a line. 
* **Higher chance of extremes:** Since Investigator 2 is dealing with shorter units, there's a higher probability of finding lines with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the overall average is 4.

Think of it like this: you're more likely to find a handful of very tall people in a small group than you are in a large crowd.
