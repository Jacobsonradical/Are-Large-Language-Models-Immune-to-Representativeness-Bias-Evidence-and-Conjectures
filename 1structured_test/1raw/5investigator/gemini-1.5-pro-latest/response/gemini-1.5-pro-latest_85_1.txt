{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a line.
* **Higher chance of extremes:**  Since Investigator 2 is dealing with these shorter units, there's a higher chance of finding lines with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the overall book average is 4. 

Imagine a line with just two words: "The" and "hippopotamus". The average word length is high, even though the book's overall average is much lower.  This scenario is less likely to happen with a full page of words.
