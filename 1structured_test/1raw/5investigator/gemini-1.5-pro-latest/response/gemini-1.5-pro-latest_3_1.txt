{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:** Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages.  A single long word can dramatically skew the average word length of a line. 
* **Higher chance of outliers:** Since Investigator 2 is dealing with these shorter units (lines), there's a higher probability of randomly getting lines with several long words in a row, pushing the average above 6. Investigator 1, looking at pages, averages out word length over a much larger sample of words, making it less likely to hit that 6+ average as often.
