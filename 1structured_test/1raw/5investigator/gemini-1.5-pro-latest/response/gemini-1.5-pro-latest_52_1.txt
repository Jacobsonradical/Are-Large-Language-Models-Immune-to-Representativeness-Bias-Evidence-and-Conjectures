Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  Individual lines are much shorter than entire pages.  A few very long words in a line can easily push the average word length of that line to 6 or more.  Pages, being longer, are less susceptible to such dramatic swings from just a few words.

* **Overall average:** The overall average word length is 4. To have a page average out to 6 or more, a significant portion of its words would need to be quite long. While possible, it's less probable than a single line having a few long words.
