{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically increase a line's average, while it has a much smaller impact on a page's average. 

* **Higher chance of extremes:**  Since Investigator 2 is dealing with shorter units, there's a higher probability of finding lines with many long words by pure chance. Investigator 1, looking at pages, averages out word length over a larger sample of words, making it less likely to hit the extreme average of 6 or more.
