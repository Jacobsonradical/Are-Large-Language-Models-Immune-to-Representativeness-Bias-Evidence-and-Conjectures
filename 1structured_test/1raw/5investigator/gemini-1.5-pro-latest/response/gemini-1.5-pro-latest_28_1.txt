Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically increase the average of a line. 
* **Overall Average:** Since the book's average word length is 4, to get a line average of 6 or more, you need a higher concentration of longer words in that short span. This is more likely to happen within individual lines than across an entire page.

**In simpler terms:** Imagine flipping a coin. You're more likely to get a streak of heads if you flip it 5 times compared to flipping it 50 times. Similarly, extreme averages (like 6 or more) are more likely in the shorter units (lines).
