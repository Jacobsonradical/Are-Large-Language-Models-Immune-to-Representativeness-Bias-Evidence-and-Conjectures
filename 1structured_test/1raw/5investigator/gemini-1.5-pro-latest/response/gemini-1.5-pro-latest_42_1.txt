{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Smaller Sample Size, Higher Variability:** Investigator 2 is looking at individual lines, which have far fewer words than an entire page. This smaller sample size makes it more likely to have extreme averages.  A single long word can dramatically skew the average word length of a line.
* **Overall Average:** Since the book's average word length is 4, to have many lines averaging 6 or more, you'd need fewer lines with lower averages to balance it out. Pages, with more words, are more likely to balance out high and low word lengths.

Therefore, Investigator 2 is much more likely to find a higher number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
