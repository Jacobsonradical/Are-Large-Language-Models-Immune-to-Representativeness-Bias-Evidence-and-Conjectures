{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:** A single line is a much shorter unit of text than an entire page.  This means it's easier for a few long words to significantly skew the average word length of a line compared to a page. 
* **Higher chance of long word clusters:**  While the overall average word length is 4, there's a higher probability of finding a cluster of longer words within a single line by random chance than within a full page.

Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to find units (lines) with an average word length of 6 or more.
