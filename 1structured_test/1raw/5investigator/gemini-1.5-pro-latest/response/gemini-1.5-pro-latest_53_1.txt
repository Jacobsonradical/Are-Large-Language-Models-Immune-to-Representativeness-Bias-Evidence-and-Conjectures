{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:** Lines, being much shorter units of text than pages, are far more likely to have extreme variations in average word length. You could have a line with several long words, easily pushing the average above 6, even if the surrounding text is more balanced. 
* **Overall average:**  The fact that the book's average word length is 4 suggests that longer words are balanced out by shorter words. However, this balancing is less likely to occur within a single line compared to a full page.

Therefore, Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is more likely to find a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
