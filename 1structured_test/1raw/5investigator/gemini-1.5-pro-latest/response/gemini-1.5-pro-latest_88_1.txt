Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically increase a line's average, while it has less impact on a page's average.
* **Higher probability of extremes:** Since lines are short, there's a higher probability of finding a line with several long words by random chance, even if the overall average word length is 4. 

Imagine a line with just two words: "The" and "hippopotamus." The average word length is high, even though the book's overall average is much lower. This scenario is less likely to happen on the scale of a whole page.
