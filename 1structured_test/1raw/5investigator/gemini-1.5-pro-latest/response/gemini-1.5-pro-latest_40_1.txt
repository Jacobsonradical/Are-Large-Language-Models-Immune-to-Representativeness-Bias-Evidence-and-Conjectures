{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages.  With fewer words, a single long word or a series of short words can dramatically swing the average word length. 
* **Higher chance of outliers:**  Investigator 2 is more likely to encounter lines with a high concentration of long words by chance, simply because they are examining smaller samples.

While the overall average word length is 4, there's a higher probability that Investigator 2 will find more lines with an average word length of 6 or more due to the increased variability in shorter text segments.
