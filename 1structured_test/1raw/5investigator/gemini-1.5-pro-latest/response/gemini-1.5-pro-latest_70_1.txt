Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a line.
* **Overall Average:**  The book has an average word length of 4.  To have lines with an average of 6 or more, you'll need a higher concentration of longer words. This is more likely to occur in a line, even if the page itself balances out to a lower average.

**Example:**

Imagine a page with these two lines:

1. "He quickly ran towards the tremendously large, imposing building."
2. "He stopped, out of breath."

The first line likely has an average word length well above 6, while the second line is likely well below. The page as a whole might average closer to 4.
