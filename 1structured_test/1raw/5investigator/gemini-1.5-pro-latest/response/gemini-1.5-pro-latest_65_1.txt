{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more sensitive to outliers:**  A single long word in a short phrase drastically increases the average word length.  Consider the difference between these two sentences:

    * "The cat sat." 
    * "The gargantuan rhinoceros lumbered."

  The second sentence has a much higher average word length due to one very long word.

* **Investigator 2 is analyzing shorter units:** Lines are significantly shorter than pages.  This means Investigator 2 is more likely to find instances where a few long words skew the average above 6.

* **The overall average is 4:** Since the book's average word length is 4, both investigators will find instances above and below the average. However, Investigator 2 is more likely to find those extreme cases on the higher end due to the smaller sample size of each line.
