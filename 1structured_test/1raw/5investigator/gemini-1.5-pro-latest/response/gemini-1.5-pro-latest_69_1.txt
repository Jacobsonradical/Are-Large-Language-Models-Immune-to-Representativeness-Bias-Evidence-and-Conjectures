{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Smaller Sample Size, Higher Variability:** Investigator 2 is looking at individual lines, which are much smaller samples of text than entire pages. Smaller samples are more likely to have extreme values (like a very high average word length) just by chance. 
* **Overall Average:** Since the book's average word length is 4,  to get a line average of 6 or more, Investigator 2 needs fewer long words to skew the average.

**In simpler terms:** Imagine flipping a coin. You're more likely to get five heads in a row if you only flip it five times, compared to flipping it a hundred times. Investigator 2 is like the person flipping the coin fewer times â€“ they have a higher chance of seeing that extreme average.
