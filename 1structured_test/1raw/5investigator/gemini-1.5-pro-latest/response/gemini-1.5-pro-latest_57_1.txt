Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  A single line is a much smaller unit of text than an entire page.  It's easier to get a higher average word length in a single line just by chance (e.g., having a few long words). 
* **The overall average matters:** The book has an average word length of 4.  To get an average of 6 or more in a line requires a more significant deviation from the average than it does in a full page.

**Example:** Imagine a page with mostly short words, but one line contains "The extraordinarily lengthy manuscript..." That single line would heavily skew the line average, while having a much smaller impact on the page average.
