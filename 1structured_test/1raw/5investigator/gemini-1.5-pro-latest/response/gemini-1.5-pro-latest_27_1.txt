{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. With fewer words, the average word length in a line is more susceptible to fluctuations.  A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a line. 
* **Higher Chance of Extremes:** Since Investigator 2 is dealing with these shorter units, there's a higher chance of randomly getting lines with a very high average word length, even if the overall average is 4.

Imagine a line with just two words: "The gargantuan..." That line's average word length is already high. It's less likely to find a whole page that deviates so dramatically from the book's average.
