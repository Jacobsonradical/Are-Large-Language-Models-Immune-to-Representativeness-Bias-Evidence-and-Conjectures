{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:** Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length.  A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a short line.
* **Higher chance of extremes:**  With shorter units, Investigator 2 has a higher probability of finding lines with unusually high average word lengths just by chance. A single sentence with longer words on a line could push the average above 6. 

While Investigator 1 might find some pages with averages of 6 or more, it's less likely that a whole page would be dominated by longer words enough to significantly outweigh the influence of shorter words in the overall average.
