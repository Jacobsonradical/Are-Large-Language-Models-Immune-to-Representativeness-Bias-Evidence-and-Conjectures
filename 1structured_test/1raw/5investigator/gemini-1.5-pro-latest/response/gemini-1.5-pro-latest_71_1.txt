{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units, higher variability:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages.  With shorter units, there's a greater chance for outliers (very long or very short words) to skew the average.
* **Reaching a higher average:** To have an average word length of 6 or more in a line, you might only need a couple of long words. However, to achieve the same average for a whole page, many more words need to be long, making it less likely.

Therefore, Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
