{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a line.
* **Higher chance of extremes:** Since Investigator 2 is dealing with these shorter units (lines), there's a higher probability of randomly encountering lines with several long words in a row, pushing the average above 6.  

While Investigator 1 might find pages with longer words, the effect is "diluted" by the larger number of words on the page, making it less likely to hit that average of 6 or more as frequently.
