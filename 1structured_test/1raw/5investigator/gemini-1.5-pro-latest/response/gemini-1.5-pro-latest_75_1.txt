{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:** Individual lines, being much shorter than entire pages, have a higher chance of being skewed by a few long words. Imagine a line with just two words: "The gargantuan...".  The average word length of that line is already high. 
* **Overall average:**  The book's average word length is 4.  To have pages with an average of 6 or more, they need to consistently contain longer words.  Lines, on the other hand, can more easily reach that 6+ average with just a couple of longer words.

Therefore, Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
