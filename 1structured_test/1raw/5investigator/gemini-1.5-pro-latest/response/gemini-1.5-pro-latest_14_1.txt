{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a line.
* **Overall average:** Since the book's average word length is 4, to get a line average of 6 or more, you need a higher concentration of long words in that line compared to getting a page average of 6.
* **Higher probability for Investigator 2:**  While both investigators might find units with an average word length of 6 or more, it's statistically more likely for Investigator 2 to encounter this due to the shorter and more variable nature of lines.
