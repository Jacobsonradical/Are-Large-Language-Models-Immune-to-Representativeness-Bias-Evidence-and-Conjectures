{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines, being much shorter units of text than pages, are more likely to have extreme variations in average word length. 
* **Higher chance of outliers:** A single long word in a line can dramatically skew the average word length upwards. Pages, with many more words, are less susceptible to this kind of outlier effect. 

Since Investigator 2 is looking at lines, they have a much higher chance of encountering units with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the overall book average is 4.
