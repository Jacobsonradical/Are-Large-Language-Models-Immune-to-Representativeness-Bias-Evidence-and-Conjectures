{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length.  A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a short line.
* **Higher chance of outliers:** Since Investigator 2 is dealing with these shorter units (lines), there's a higher probability of finding outlier lines with a very high average word length, even if the overall book average is 4. 

While Investigator 1 might find some pages with an average of 6 or more, Investigator 2 is likely to find many more lines meeting that criterion.
