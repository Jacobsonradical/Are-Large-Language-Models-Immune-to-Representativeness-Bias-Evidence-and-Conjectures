{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Smaller Samples, Higher Variability:** Investigator 2 is working with lines, which are much smaller samples of text than entire pages. Smaller samples are more likely to have extreme variations. It's easier for a few long words to significantly skew the average word length of a single line.
* **Overall Average:**  The book having an average word length of 4 suggests that longer words (6 or more letters) are less frequent. It's more likely for a line to have a few long words randomly clustered together than an entire page. 

Let me know if you'd like another thought experiment!
