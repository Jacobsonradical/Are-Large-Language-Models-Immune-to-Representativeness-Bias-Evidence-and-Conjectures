{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages.  This means they are more likely to have extreme variations in average word length. 
* **Higher chance of outliers:** A single long word in a short line can dramatically skew the average word length for that line. It's much harder for a single long word to significantly impact the average word length of an entire page.

Since Investigator 2 is looking at lines, which are more prone to these fluctuations, they are more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
