{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically increase a line's average, while it has a much smaller impact on a page's average.

* **Higher probability of extremes:** Since Investigator 2 is dealing with shorter units (lines), there's a higher chance of randomly encountering lines with several long words in a row, pushing the average above 6. 

* **Overall Book Average:**  The fact that the book's average word length is 4 doesn't change the underlying probability. Even with a low average, there will still be more instances of lines exceeding 6 letters on average compared to pages.
