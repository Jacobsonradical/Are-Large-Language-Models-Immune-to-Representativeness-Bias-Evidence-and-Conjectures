{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units, greater variance:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages.  With shorter units, there's a higher chance of getting more extreme averages.  
* **Example:** Imagine a line with just two long words. The average word length for that line will be very high. It's less likely to have an entire page skewed so dramatically by just a couple of words.

Since Investigator 2 is looking at lines, they are more likely to encounter these short bursts of longer words, leading to a higher count of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
