{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages. This means they are more likely to have extreme variations in average word length. 
* **Higher chance of outliers:** A single long word in a line can significantly skew the average word length for that line.  Pages, with more words, are less susceptible to this kind of outlier effect.

Since Investigator 2 is looking at lines, which are more prone to having higher average word lengths simply due to random variation, they are likely to find more units with an average word length of 6 or more.
