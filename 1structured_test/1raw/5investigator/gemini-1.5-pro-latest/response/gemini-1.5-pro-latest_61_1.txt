{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Higher Variance in Smaller Samples:** Averages over shorter text segments (like a single line) will fluctuate more wildly than averages over longer segments (like a whole page).  You're more likely to find a string of unusually long words in a single line than on an entire page.
* **Target Average Above the Overall Average:** Since the target average word length (6) is significantly higher than the book's average (4), we're looking for outliers.  Outliers are more common in smaller sample sizes. 

**In short:** Investigator 2, focusing on individual lines, is more likely to encounter those short bursts of longer words that push the average above 6.
