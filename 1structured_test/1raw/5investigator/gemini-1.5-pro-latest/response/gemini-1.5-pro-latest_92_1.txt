{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines, being much shorter than pages, are more likely to have extreme average word lengths.  A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a line. 
* **Overall average:** Since the book has an average word length of 4, to get a line average of 6 or more requires a higher concentration of longer words within that short span.
* **Probability:** While both investigators might find units with averages above 6, Investigator 2 is dealing with a much larger quantity of smaller units (lines). This greatly increases the probability of finding lines with those extreme averages compared to Investigator 1 finding pages with those averages.
