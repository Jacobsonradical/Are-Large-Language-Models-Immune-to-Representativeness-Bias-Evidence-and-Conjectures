Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages. A single long word can dramatically skew the average word length of a line. Pages, being longer, are more likely to balance out longer and shorter words, making it harder to reach an average of 6 or more.

* **Think of an example:** Imagine a line with just two words: "The" and "hippopotamus". The average word length is very high.  It's much harder to achieve such a high average over an entire page of text.
