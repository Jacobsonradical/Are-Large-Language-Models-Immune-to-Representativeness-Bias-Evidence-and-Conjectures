{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:** A single line is a much smaller unit of text than an entire page. It's far easier to get a high average word length in a single line (imagine a line with a few technical terms) than it is to maintain that high average over a whole page. 
* **Averaging smooths out variation:** A page averages out the word lengths of many lines. This means a page is less likely to be drastically above or below the overall book's average.

**Therefore, Investigator 2, looking at individual lines, is much more likely to find units with an average word length of 6 or more.**
