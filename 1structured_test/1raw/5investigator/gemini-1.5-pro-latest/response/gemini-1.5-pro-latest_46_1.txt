Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  A single line of text is a much smaller unit than an entire page. It's more likely for a few long words to significantly skew the average word length of a line than it is for them to do the same to an entire page.  
* **The overall average is 4:**  Since the book's average word length is 4,  lines with an average of 6 or more are relatively high above the norm.  Pages, being larger, are more likely to average out closer to the book's overall average.

**In simpler terms:** Imagine throwing a handful of darts at a dartboard. You're more likely to get more darts clustered around the center (the average). It's less likely a single dart will land far out from the center. Investigator 2 is looking at individual "darts" (lines) while Investigator 1 is looking at the average of a small cluster of darts (pages).
