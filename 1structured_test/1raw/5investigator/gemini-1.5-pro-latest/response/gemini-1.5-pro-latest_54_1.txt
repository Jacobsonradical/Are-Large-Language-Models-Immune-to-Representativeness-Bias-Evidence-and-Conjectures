{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Averaging Effect:** Pages contain significantly more words than individual lines. This means the average word length on a page is less likely to be heavily skewed by a few long or short words. 
* **Higher Probability:**  Investigator 1's method, averaging over a larger sample size (words per page), makes it more likely to find units (pages) with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the book's overall average is 4. 

Let's illustrate with an example:

Imagine a page with these two lines:

1. "The quick brown fox jumps." (Average word length: less than 4)
2. "Over there, a tremendously lengthy word appeared, astonishing everyone." (Average word length: much higher than 4)

* Investigator 1 (analyzing the whole page) might get an average close to 6.
* Investigator 2 (analyzing only the first line) would get an average much lower than 6.

While extreme examples like this might not be common, the principle holds. Averaging over larger samples (pages) smooths out the variation and makes it more likely to find averages further from the overall mean.
