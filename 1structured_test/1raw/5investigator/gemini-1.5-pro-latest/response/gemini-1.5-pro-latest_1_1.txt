{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically increase a line's average, while it has a much smaller effect on a page's average.
* **Higher chance of extremes:** Because lines are shorter, there's a higher probability of finding a line composed mostly of long words, pushing the average above 6. Pages, with their larger word sample, are more likely to have averages closer to the overall book average of 4. 

Therefore, Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is more likely to find a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
