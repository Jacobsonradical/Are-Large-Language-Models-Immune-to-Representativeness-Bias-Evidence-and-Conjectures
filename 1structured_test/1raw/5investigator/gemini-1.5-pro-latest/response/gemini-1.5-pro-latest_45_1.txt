{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variance:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. With shorter units, there's a greater chance for outliers to skew the average.  
* **Example:** Imagine a line with just two words: "The" and "hippopotamus". The average word length is very high. This is less likely to happen on a page with many words, where longer and shorter words balance each other out.

Since Investigator 2 is looking at lines, they are more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
