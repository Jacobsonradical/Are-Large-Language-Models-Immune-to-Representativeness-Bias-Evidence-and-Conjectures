Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:** Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages.  This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically increase a line's average, while it would have a much smaller impact on a page's average. 

* **Higher probability of extremes:** Since lines are shorter, there's a higher chance of randomly getting several long words in a single line, pushing the average above 6. Pages, with more words, are more likely to balance out longer and shorter words, making it statistically less likely to reach an average of 6 or more.
