{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units, higher variability:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages.  With shorter units, there's a greater chance of having more extreme averages. Imagine a line with just two very long words â€“ it could easily have an average word length of 6 or more. 
* **Overall average as an anchor:**  The book's average word length is 4. To have many pages average 6 or more, you'd need a lot of pages with even shorter average word lengths to balance things out. This is less likely than lines having that extreme variation.

**In short:** Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is more likely to find a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more due to the higher variability within shorter text units.
