{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines, being much shorter units of text than pages, have a higher chance of containing a string of longer words that would significantly skew the average word length. 
* **Overall average:** The fact that the book's average word length is 4 suggests that longer words (6 or more letters) are less common. It's more likely for a line to have a concentration of longer words by chance than for a whole page to have such a concentration.

Therefore, Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
