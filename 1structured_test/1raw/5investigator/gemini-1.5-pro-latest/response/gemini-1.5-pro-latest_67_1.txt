Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines, being much shorter than pages, have a higher chance of containing a cluster of longer words by pure chance. A single long word can dramatically skew the average word length of a line. 
* **Overall average:** Since the book's average word length is 4,  to have a line average 6 or more, you need a higher concentration of longer words compared to a page needing that average.

**Example:** Imagine a line with just two words: "Elephantine rambunctiousness."  This line would have a very high average word length. It's less likely to find a page in the book where the average word length is skewed so high simply due to the larger sample size of words on a page.
