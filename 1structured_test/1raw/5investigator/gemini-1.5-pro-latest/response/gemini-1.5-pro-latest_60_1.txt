Here's why:

* **Averaging Effects:** Pages contain significantly more words than individual lines. This means that a page's average word length is influenced by a larger sample of words. It's less likely for a page's average to be skewed significantly higher (to 6 or more) by a few long words. 
* **Higher Variance in Lines:** Lines have a much smaller sample size of words. This means that a single long word can dramatically influence the average word length of that line, making it more likely for Investigator 2 to encounter lines with an average of 6 or more.

**In essence, pages are more likely to have an average word length closer to the overall book average due to the larger sample size, while lines are more prone to extreme variations.**
