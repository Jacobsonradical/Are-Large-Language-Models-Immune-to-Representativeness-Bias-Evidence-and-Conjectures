{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Shorter units, higher variance:** Lines are significantly shorter units of text than pages.  This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a short line.
* **Overall average:** The overall average word length of 4 suggests that longer words (6 or more letters) are less frequent. However, it's easier for these less frequent longer words to dominate the average within a short line than within a longer page. 

**Therefore, Investigator 2 (looking at lines) is more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.**
