{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units, higher variability:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means there's a higher chance for lines to have more extreme average word lengths simply by having a few long or short words in a row. 
* **Averaging effect:** Pages, being longer, tend to average out word lengths more. It's less likely that a page will have a significantly higher average word length unless it consistently uses longer words.

Since Investigator 2 is looking at lines, they are more likely to encounter units with an average word length of 6 or more.
