Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  A single line has far fewer words than an entire page. This means a few long words in a line can dramatically skew the average word length for that line. A page, with many more words, is more resistant to such large swings in average word length.

* **Overall average:** Since the book's average word length is 4, to get a line average of 6 or more, you need a higher concentration of longer words. This is more likely to happen in individual lines (Investigator 2) than over the larger sample size of a whole page (Investigator 1).
