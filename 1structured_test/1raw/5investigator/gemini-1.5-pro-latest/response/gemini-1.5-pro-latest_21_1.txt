{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Averaging Effects:** Averages smooth out extremes. A page is made up of multiple lines.  For a page to have an average word length of 6 or more, it needs several long words.  A single line has a higher chance of having an average word length of 6 or more simply because there are fewer words to balance out one or two very long words. 
* **Higher Probability:**  Investigator 2 is more likely to encounter lines with a few long words by chance, even if the overall average word length is 4.
