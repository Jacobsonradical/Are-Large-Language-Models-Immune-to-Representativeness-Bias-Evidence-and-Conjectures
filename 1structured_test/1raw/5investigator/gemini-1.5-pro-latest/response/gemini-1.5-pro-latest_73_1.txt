{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:** Individual lines are much shorter than entire pages. This means they have a higher chance of having extreme average word lengths (either very high or very low) just by random chance. 
* **Higher probability of longer words:**  A single long word in a line can significantly skew the average word length upwards. Pages, being longer, are less susceptible to this kind of fluctuation.

Since Investigator 2 is looking at lines, which are more prone to these variations, they are more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
