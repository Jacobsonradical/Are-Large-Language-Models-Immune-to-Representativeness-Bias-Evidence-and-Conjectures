Here's why:

* **Averaging Effects:**  A page contains many lines.  To have an average word length of 6 or more on a page, you need multiple lines with longer words to outweigh any lines with shorter words.  
* **Higher Probability of Extremes:**  Individual lines are shorter samples of text. Shorter samples are more likely to have extreme averages (either very high or very low). 

Investigator 2 is dealing with these smaller samples (lines) which are more prone to having those extreme average word lengths.  Therefore, Investigator 2 is likely to count a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
