Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages.  A single long word can dramatically skew the average word length of a line. A page, with many more words, is less susceptible to these large swings caused by individual words.

* **The overall average:** The fact that the book's average word length is 4 tells us that long words (6 or more letters) are less frequent. It's more likely for a line to have a concentration of these less frequent long words by chance than it is for an entire page.
