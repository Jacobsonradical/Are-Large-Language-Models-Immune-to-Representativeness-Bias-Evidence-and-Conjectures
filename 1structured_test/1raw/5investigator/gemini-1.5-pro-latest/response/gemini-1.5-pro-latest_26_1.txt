{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:** Individual lines are much shorter than entire pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length.  A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a line.
* **Higher chance of extremes:** With shorter units (lines), there's a higher likelihood of finding extremes. It's easier to have a line with several long words by chance than an entire page dominated by long words. 

Since Investigator 2 is dealing with lines, which are more likely to have extreme averages, they are more likely to find more units with an average word length of 6 or more.
