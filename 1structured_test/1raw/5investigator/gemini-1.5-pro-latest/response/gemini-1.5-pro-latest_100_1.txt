{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages.  A few long words in a line can easily push the average word length up to 6 or more. It's less likely for an entire page to have a high average word length because it averages out over a larger sample of words.
* **Overall average:** The fact that the book's average word length is 4 suggests that longer words are less frequent.  Investigator 2, focusing on shorter lines, has a higher chance of capturing those less frequent longer words and thus getting a higher average for that line.
