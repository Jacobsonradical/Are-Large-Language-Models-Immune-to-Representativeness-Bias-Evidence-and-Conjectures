Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  A single long word has a greater impact on the average word length of a line than it does on the average word length of an entire page.  
* **Higher chance of outliers:** Since lines are shorter units of text, there's a higher likelihood of finding a line with several long words that skews its average significantly upwards. Pages, being longer, are more likely to balance out the presence of a few long words.

Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is more likely to encounter these short bursts of longer words that push the average above 6.
