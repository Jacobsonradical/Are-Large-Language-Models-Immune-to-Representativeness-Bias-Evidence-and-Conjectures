{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Averaging Effects:** Investigator 1 is averaging over entire pages, which means they are considering many more words than Investigator 2, who is only looking at a single line. 
* **Higher Chance of Extremes:**  It's statistically more likely for a single line to have a high average word length (due to a few long words) than an entire page. A page average is more likely to be pulled closer to the book's overall average of 4.

Since Investigator 1 is dealing with larger samples (pages) that are more likely to be representative of the overall average, they are less likely to find extreme values (average word length of 6 or more).
