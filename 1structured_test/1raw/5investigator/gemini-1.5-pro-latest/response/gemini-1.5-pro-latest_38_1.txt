Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means individual lines have a greater chance of being skewed by longer or shorter words. 
* **Higher Average Requires Outliers:**  To get an average word length of 6 (significantly higher than the book's average of 4), you need a higher concentration of longer words. This is more likely to occur in a short line than on an entire page.

**Example:** Imagine a line with these words: "The large, extraordinarily fluffy cat."  This line could easily have an average word length of 6 or more.  However, it's less probable for an entire page to maintain such a high average.
