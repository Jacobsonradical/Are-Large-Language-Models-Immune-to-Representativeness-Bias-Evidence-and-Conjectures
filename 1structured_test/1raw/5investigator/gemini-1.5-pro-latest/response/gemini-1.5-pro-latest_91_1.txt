{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:** Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages. This means they are more susceptible to larger swings in average word length. A single long word in a short line can dramatically skew the average upwards. 
* **Higher chance of extremes:**  Investigator 2, focusing on lines, has a higher probability of encountering those short bursts of long words that push the average above 6.
* **Overall average:** The fact that the book's average word length is 4 doesn't change the likelihood that Investigator 2 will find more instances exceeding 6.  

While Investigator 1 might find some pages with averages above 6, it's more probable that Investigator 2 will find a larger number of lines meeting that criteria.
