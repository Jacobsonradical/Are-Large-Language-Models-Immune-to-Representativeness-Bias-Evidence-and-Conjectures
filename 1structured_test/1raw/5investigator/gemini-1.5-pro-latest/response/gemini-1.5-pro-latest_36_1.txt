Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means there's a greater chance for a few long words to significantly skew the average word length of a line. A page, with many more words, is less likely to be dramatically impacted by a handful of long words.
* **Overall Average:** Since the average word length of the book is 4, to get a line average of 6 or more, you need a higher concentration of long words in that line compared to what you'd need on a page to reach the same average.

**In simpler terms:**  It's easier for a few long words to "overpower" the average in a short line than in a longer page.
