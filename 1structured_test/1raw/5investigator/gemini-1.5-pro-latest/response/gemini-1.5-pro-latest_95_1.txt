{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically increase a line's average, while it would have a much smaller impact on a page's average. 

* **Higher chance of extremes:** Since Investigator 2 is dealing with these shorter units, there's a higher likelihood of finding lines with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the overall book average is 4.

* **Think of an example:** Imagine a line with just two words: "The" and "hippopotamus". The average word length is high. It's much harder to achieve such a high average across an entire page.
