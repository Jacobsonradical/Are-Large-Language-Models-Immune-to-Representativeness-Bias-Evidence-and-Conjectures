{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:** Investigator 2 is analyzing lines, which are much shorter units of text than pages. Shorter units of text are more likely to have extreme variations in average word length. 
* **Example:** Imagine a line with just two words: "The hippopotamus." The average word length is very high.  A full page is very unlikely to have such a skewed average because it contains many more words.
* **Overall Average:**  While the average word length of the book is 4, the presence of even a few long words in a line can easily push the average of that line above 6.  Pages, with their larger word count, are more resistant to such drastic shifts.

Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to find a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
