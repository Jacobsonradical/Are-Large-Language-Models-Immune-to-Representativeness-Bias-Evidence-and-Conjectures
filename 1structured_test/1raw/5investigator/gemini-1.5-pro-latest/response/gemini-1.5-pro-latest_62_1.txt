{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. A single long word can dramatically skew the average word length of a line. Pages, with many words, are more likely to average out variations in word length.
* **Aiming for an unusual average:** An average word length of 6 is quite high considering the overall book average is 4. It's more probable to achieve this high average by chance within a shorter unit (a line) than a longer one (a page).

Therefore, Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
