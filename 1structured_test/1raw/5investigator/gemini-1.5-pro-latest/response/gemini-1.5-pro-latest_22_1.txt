{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Individual lines are much shorter than entire pages. This means they have a greater chance of having a higher average word length just by chance. A single long word can significantly skew the average in a line.
* **Lower sample size amplifies the effect:** While there are many lines within a page, the total number of pages is still significantly less than the total number of lines in the book. This lower sample size for Investigator 1 means the averaging effect is stronger, making it less likely to see extreme values like an average word length of 6. 

Therefore, Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is much more likely to find units with an average word length of 6 or more.
