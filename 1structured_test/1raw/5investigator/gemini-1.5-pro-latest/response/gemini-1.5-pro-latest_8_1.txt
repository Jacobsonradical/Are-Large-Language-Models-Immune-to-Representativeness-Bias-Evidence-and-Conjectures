{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages. This means they are more likely to have extreme variations in average word length. 
* **Higher chance of longer words:** A single long word in a line can significantly skew the average word length upwards. Pages, with their larger word count, are less susceptible to this kind of skew.

Since Investigator 2 is focusing on lines, which are more prone to these fluctuations, they are more likely to find units with an average word length of 6 or more.
