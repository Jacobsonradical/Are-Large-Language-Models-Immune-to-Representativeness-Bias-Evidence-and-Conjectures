{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a short line.
* **Higher chance of outliers:** Since Investigator 2 is dealing with these shorter units, there's a higher probability of randomly encountering a line with several longer words, pushing the average above 6. 
* **Overall average:** While the entire book averages to 4, the presence of longer words in some lines (and therefore some pages) means there must be enough shorter words to balance it out.  Investigator 2 is more likely to capture those sporadic longer words.
