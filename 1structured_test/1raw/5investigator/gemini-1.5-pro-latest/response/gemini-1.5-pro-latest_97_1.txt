Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:** A single line is a much smaller unit of text than an entire page.  This means there's a higher chance for a few long words to significantly skew the average word length of a line.  
* **Overall average:** Since the book's average word length is 4, to get a line average of 6 or more requires a higher concentration of longer words within that line. This is more probable than achieving the same average across a larger sample like a whole page.

While it's possible for a page to have an average word length of 6 or more, it's much more likely for individual lines to reach that threshold due to the smaller sample size.
