{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages.  This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically increase the average of a line. 
* **Higher likelihood of extremes:** With shorter units, Investigator 2 is more likely to find lines with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the overall book average is 4.

Imagine a line with just two words: "The" and "hippopotamus". The average word length is high, even though the rest of the page might have shorter words. This scenario is less likely to happen with a full page of text, which allows for more word variety and a tendency towards the overall average.
