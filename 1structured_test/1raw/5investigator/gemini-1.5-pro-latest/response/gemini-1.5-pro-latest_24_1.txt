{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages.  This means there's a greater chance for a few long words to significantly skew the average word length of a line.  
* **Example:** Imagine a line with just two words: "The" and "hippopotamus". The average word length would be very high. However, a page containing that line would likely have many other shorter words, bringing the page average down closer to the book's overall average.

Since Investigator 2 is dealing with shorter units of text (lines), they are more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the book's overall average is 4.
