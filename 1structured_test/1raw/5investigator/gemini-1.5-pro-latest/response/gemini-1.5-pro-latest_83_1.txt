{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines, being much shorter units of text than pages, are more likely to have extreme variations in average word length. 
* **Higher chance of outliers:** A single long word in a line can significantly skew the average upwards. While a page could contain a very long word, it's also likely to have many shorter words balancing it out. 

Since Investigator 2 is focusing on lines, they have a higher chance of encountering these short bursts of long words, leading to more instances of an average word length of 6 or more.
