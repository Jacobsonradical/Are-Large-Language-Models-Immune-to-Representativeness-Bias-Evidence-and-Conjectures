{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:** Individual lines, being much shorter than entire pages, have a higher chance of containing an unusual concentration of long or short words. A single long word can drastically skew the average word length of a line.
* **Averaging smooths out extremes:**  Pages, encompassing many lines, are more likely to balance out long and short words, leading to an average closer to the book's overall average word length.

Since Investigator 2 is looking at lines (shorter units), they are more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the book's overall average is 4.
