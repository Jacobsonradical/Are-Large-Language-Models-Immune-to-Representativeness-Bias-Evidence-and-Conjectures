{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units, higher variability:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages.  With shorter units, there's a greater chance for outliers (very long or very short words) to skew the average.  
* **Higher averages more likely:**  To have an average word length of 6 or more in a line is more probable than in a whole page. A single long word can significantly influence the average of a line, while its impact is diluted in the average of a page. 

Therefore, Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is more likely to encounter units with an average word length of 6 or more.
