{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:** Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically increase the average of a line. 
* **Higher chance of extremes:** With shorter units, Investigator 2 is more likely to encounter lines with a high concentration of long words, even if the overall book's average word length is 4. 

While Investigator 1 might find some pages with longer words, it's less likely that a full page would consistently have enough long words to push the average to 6 or above.
