Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means there's a higher chance for lines to have more extreme average word lengths (either very high or very low) just by random variation in the words used. 
* **Averaging Effect:** Pages, being longer, will average out word lengths more. It's less likely for a page to have an average word length of 6 or more if the overall book average is 4.

**In simple terms:**  It's easier for a single line to be skewed towards longer words than it is for an entire page to be skewed the same way.
