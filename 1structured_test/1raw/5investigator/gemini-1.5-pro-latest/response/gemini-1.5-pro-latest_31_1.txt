{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Smaller Samples, Higher Variability:** Investigator 2 is analyzing much smaller units of text (single lines) compared to Investigator 1 (entire pages). Smaller samples are more susceptible to extreme variations. 
* **Increased Likelihood of Outliers:**  A single long word in a line can dramatically skew the average word length upwards.  Pages, being larger samples, are less likely to be drastically affected by one or two long words.

Since Investigator 2 is dealing with smaller samples, they are more likely to encounter lines with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the overall book average is 4.
