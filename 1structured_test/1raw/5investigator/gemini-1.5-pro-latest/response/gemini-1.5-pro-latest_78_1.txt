{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they are more likely to have extreme variations in average word length.  
* **Higher chance of outliers:** A single long word in a short line can drastically skew the average word length upwards. It's less likely for a page to be heavily skewed by a few long words because it has more words overall.

Since Investigator 2 is looking at lines, which are more susceptible to these fluctuations, they are more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
