{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Averaging Effects:**  Investigator 1 is averaging over entire pages. This means long words are averaged with many more shorter words, making it harder to reach an average of 6 or more. 
* **Increased Probability:** Investigator 2, focusing on single lines, has a higher chance of encountering lines with a higher proportion of longer words. A single long word within a short line can significantly bump up the average.

While it's theoretically possible for Investigator 1 to have a similar count if the book has very specific word arrangements, it's statistically more likely that Investigator 2 will find more instances of lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
