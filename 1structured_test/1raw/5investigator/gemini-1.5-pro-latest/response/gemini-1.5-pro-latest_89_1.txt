Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages.  It's easier to get a higher average word length in a single line just by chance (a few long words) compared to an entire page. 
* **Overall average:** Since the book's average word length is 4, to get a line or page averaging 6, you need a higher concentration of longer words. This is more likely to happen within the smaller unit (a line).
