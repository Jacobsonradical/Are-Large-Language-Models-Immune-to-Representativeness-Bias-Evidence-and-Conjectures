{investigator: 2}

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines, being shorter units of text than pages, are more likely to have extreme variations in average word length. 
* **Higher chance of outliers:** A single long word in a line can dramatically skew the average word length for that line. It's less likely for a single long word to have such a drastic effect on the average word length of an entire page.

Since Investigator 2 is looking at lines, they have a higher chance of finding units (lines) with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the overall book average is 4.
