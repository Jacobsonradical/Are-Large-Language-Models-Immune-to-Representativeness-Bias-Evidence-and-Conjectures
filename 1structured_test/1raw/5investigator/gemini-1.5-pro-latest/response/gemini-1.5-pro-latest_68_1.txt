{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  A single line has a much higher chance of having an average word length of 6 or more compared to an entire page.  Imagine a line with a few very long words - it can easily skew the average. A page, with many more words, is far less likely to be influenced by a few long words. 

* **Overall average:** The fact that the book's average word length is 4 reinforces this.  Since pages are longer, they are more likely to pull the average closer to 4. Lines, being shorter, have more freedom to deviate.

Therefore, Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is much more likely to encounter units with an average word length of 6 or more.
