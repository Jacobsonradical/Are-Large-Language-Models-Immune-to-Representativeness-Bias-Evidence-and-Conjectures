{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines, being much shorter units of text than pages, are more likely to have extreme variations in average word length. Imagine a line with just two long words â€“ it would have a very high average. 
* **Overall average:** Since the book has an average word length of 4, to have pages with an average of 6 or more, you'd need a concentration of longer words on those pages. This is less likely than a single line having a few long words that skew its average.

Therefore, Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is more likely to find a higher number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
