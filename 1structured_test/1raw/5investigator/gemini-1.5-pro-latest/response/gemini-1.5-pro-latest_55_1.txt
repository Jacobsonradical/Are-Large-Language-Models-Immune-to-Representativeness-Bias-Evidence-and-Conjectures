Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  A single line has far fewer words than an entire page. This means a line is much more susceptible to large swings in average word length based on just a couple of long or short words. 
* **Higher chance of long words in a line:** To have an average word length of 6 or more, you need some longer words. It's more likely to find a sequence of longer words within a single line than to have enough long words distributed throughout an entire page to bring the average that high.

**Example:** Imagine a page with mostly 3 and 4 letter words. A single line with "extraordinary" and "hippopotamus" suddenly has a very high average, while the page average remains relatively unaffected.
