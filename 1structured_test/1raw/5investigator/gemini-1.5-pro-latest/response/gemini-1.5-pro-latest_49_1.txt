{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines, being much shorter than pages, are more likely to have extreme variations in average word length.  You could have a line with a few very long words that skews the average significantly. 
* **Higher chance of outliers:**  Since Investigator 2 is dealing with smaller samples (lines), there's a higher probability of randomly getting a line with several long words, pushing the average above 6. 

While the overall average word length is 4, the smaller the unit of measurement, the more likely you are to see significant deviations from that average.
