{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically increase the average of a line. 
* **Overall average:** Since the book's average word length is 4, to have lines averaging 6 or more, you need a higher concentration of longer words in those specific lines. This is more likely to occur in individual lines than across entire pages.

**In short:** Investigator 2 is dealing with smaller samples of text (lines), making it more likely to find units with higher-than-average word lengths.
