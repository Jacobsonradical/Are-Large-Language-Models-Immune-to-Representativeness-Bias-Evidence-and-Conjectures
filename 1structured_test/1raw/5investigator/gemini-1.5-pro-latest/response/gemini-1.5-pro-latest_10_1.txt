{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they have a higher chance of containing a cluster of longer words, which would dramatically swing their average word length. 
* **Overall average:** Since the average word length of the book is 4,  getting an average of 6 or more in a line is more likely than getting that same high average across a whole page. 

Investigator 2 is dealing with smaller, more variable units of text, making it more probable they'd encounter more instances of a higher average word length.
