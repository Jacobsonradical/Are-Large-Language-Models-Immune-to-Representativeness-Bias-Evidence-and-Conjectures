{investigator: 1} 

Here's why:

* **Averaging Effects:** A page contains significantly more words than a single line. This means the average word length on a page is influenced by a larger sample of words.  
* **Outliers:** A single long word can drastically skew the average word length of a line.  A page is more likely to balance out the effect of a few long or short words. 

Since the overall book average is 4, it's more likely that pages (with their larger word samples) will have averages closer to 4. Lines are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. Therefore, Investigator 1 (looking at pages) is less likely to find units with an average word length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 2 (looking at lines).
