{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  Individual lines are much shorter units of text than entire pages. With fewer words, a single long word can drastically skew the average word length of a line. 
* **Higher chance of outliers:**  Investigator 2 is more likely to encounter lines where a cluster of longer words pushes the average above 6, even if the overall book average is 4. 

While Investigator 1 might find some pages with averages above 6, it's less probable due to the larger sample size of words on each page.
