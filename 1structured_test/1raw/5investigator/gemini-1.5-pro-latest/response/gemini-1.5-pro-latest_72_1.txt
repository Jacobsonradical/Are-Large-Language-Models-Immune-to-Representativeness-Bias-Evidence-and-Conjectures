{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages.  This means they are more likely to have extreme variations in average word length. You could have a line with several long words, easily pushing the average above 6, even if the surrounding text is more typical.
* **Overall average:** Since the book's average word length is 4, to get a page average of 6 or more, you'd need a higher concentration of long words sustained over a longer stretch of text. 

While it's possible for Investigator 1 to find some pages with a high average word length, Investigator 2 is much more likely to find numerous lines that meet the criteria simply due to the increased probability of random variation in shorter text units.
