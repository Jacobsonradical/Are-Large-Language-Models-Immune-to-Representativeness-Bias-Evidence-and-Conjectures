{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages.  With shorter units, there's a greater chance of getting more extreme averages (either very high or very low). 
* **Example:** Imagine a page with these two lines:
    * "This is a sentence."
    * "Contemporaneously, lexicographers analyzed the complexities."
    The first line has a low average word length, while the second line has a very high average. This single page would likely have a moderate average word length overall.

Since Investigator 2 is looking at lines, they are much more likely to find units with an average word length of 6 or more, even if the overall book average is 4.
