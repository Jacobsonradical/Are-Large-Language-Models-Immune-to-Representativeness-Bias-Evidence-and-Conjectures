Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means there's a higher chance for a few long words to significantly skew the average word length of a line.  
* **Overall Average:** The overall average word length is 4. For a line to have an average of 6 or more, it only needs a small cluster of longer words. However, a page needs a much larger concentration of longer words to reach that average, making it less likely.

**In essence, the shorter the unit of text, the more susceptible it is to fluctuations in average word length.**
