{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Individual lines of text are much shorter units of language than entire pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can drastically inflate the average of a line.
* **Lower likelihood of extremes averaging out:** In a page, the longer and shorter words are more likely to average out, making it less probable to hit an average word length of 6 or more.

Therefore, Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is more likely to encounter extreme averages and record a higher count.
