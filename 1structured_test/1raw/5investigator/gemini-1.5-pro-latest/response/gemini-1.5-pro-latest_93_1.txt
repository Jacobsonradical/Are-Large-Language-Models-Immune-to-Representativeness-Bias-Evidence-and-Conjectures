{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages.  It's easier for a few long words to significantly skew the average word length of a line.  A page, with many more words, is less likely to be drastically affected by a few long words.

* **Think of the overall average:** The entire book averages a word length of 4. To get a line average of 6 or more, you need a higher concentration of longer words than you would on a page with the same average. 

Since lines are more susceptible to fluctuations in average word length, Investigator 2 is more likely to find more units with an average word length of 6 or more.
