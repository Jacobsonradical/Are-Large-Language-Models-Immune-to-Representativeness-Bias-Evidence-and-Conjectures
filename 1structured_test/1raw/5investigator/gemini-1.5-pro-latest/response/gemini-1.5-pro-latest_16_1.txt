Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more volatile:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means they are more susceptible to large swings in average word length. A single long word can dramatically skew the average of a line.
* **Higher chance of extremes:**  Because lines are shorter, there's a higher probability that a line will randomly contain a higher concentration of long words, pushing the average above 6.  Pages, being longer, tend to average out word length variations more.

**In simple terms:** It's like flipping a coin. You're more likely to get a streak of heads if you flip it 5 times compared to flipping it 50 times.  Similarly, short lines of text are more likely to have extreme average word lengths than longer pages.
