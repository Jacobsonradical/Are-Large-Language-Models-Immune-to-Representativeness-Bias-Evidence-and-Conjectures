{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:**  A single line has far fewer words than an entire page.  This means it's much easier for a few long words to significantly skew the average word length of a line upwards compared to a page. 
* **Overall average:** Since the book's average word length is 4, to get a line or page average of 6, you need a higher concentration of longer words. It's more likely to find this concentration in a shorter unit (a line) than a longer one (a page).

Therefore, Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is much more likely to find units with an average word length of 6 or more.
