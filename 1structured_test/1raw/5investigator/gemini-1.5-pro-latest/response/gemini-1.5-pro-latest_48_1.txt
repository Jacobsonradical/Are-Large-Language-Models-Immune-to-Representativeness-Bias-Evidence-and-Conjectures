{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:** Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means there's a higher chance for lines to have more extreme average word lengths (either very high or very low) simply due to random variation in the words used. 
* **Averaging Effect:** Pages, being longer, tend to average out word lengths. While a page might contain a line or two with many long words, it's likely to be balanced by other lines with shorter words.

**In summary:** Investigator 2, focusing on lines, is more likely to encounter those short bursts of longer words that would push the average word length to 6 or more.
