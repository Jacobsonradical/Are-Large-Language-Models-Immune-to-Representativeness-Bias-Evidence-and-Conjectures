{investigator: 2} 

Here's why:

* **Shorter Units, Higher Variability:**  Lines are much shorter units of text than pages. This means there's a greater chance for a few long words to significantly skew the average word length of a line. 
* **Example:** Imagine a line with just two words: "The" and "encyclopedia". The average word length is high, even though this might not represent the typical word length on the page.  

Since Investigator 2 is dealing with these smaller, more variable units, they are more likely to find a higher number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
