Here's why:

* **Shorter units are more likely to have extremes:** A single line is a much shorter unit of text than an entire page. It's more likely for a few long words to significantly skew the average word length of a line. 
* **Overall average:** The book's average word length is 4. To have a line average out to 6 or more, you need a higher concentration of longer words in that shorter span. While pages *can* have averages of 6 or more, it's more likely to happen within individual lines due to the smaller sample size.

Let me know if you'd like another thought experiment!
