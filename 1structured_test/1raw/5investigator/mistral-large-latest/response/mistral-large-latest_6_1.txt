{investigator: 2}

Explanation: Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of each page might contain longer words, such as chapter titles, proper nouns, or specific terms, which can skew the average word-length higher compared to the average word-length of the entire page.
