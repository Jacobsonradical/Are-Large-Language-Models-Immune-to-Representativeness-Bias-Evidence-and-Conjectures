{investigator: 2}

Explanation: Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of each page might contain longer words, such as proper nouns or specific terms, which can increase the average word-length of that line. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length across entire pages, which is more likely to be closer to the overall average of the book (4) due to the larger sample size on each page.
