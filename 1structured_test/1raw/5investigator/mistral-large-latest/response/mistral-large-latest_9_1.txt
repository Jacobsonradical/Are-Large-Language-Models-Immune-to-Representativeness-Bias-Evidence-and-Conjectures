{investigator: 2}

Explanation: Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of each page might contain longer words, such as proper nouns or specific terms that set the context for the page, leading to a higher average word-length in those lines compared to the overall average word-length of the entire page.
