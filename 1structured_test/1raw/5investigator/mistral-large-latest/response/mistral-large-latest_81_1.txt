{investigator: 2}

Explanation: Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page often contains longer words as it might start a new paragraph or section, which tend to have longer words on average. Additionally, a single line is a smaller sample size compared to a whole page, so it's more likely to have a higher average word-length due to variability.
