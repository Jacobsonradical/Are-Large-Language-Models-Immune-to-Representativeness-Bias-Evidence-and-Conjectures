{investigator: 2}

My reasoning is that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such units. Since Investigator 2 only considers the first line of each page, they are more likely to encounter shorter sentences or even fragments, which could have a higher average word length. On the other hand, Investigator 1 calculates the average word length of entire pages, which would include longer sentences and more diverse sentence structures, making it less likely for the average word length to reach 6 or more. However, this is a general assumption, and the actual result could vary depending on the specific content and layout of the book.
