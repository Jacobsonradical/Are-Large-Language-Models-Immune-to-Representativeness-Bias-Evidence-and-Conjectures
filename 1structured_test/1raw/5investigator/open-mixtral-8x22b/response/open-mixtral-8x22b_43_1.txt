{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that a single line can have a higher variability in average word-length compared to an entire page, due to the smaller sample size. So, it's more likely for a line to have an average word-length of 6 or more than a whole page, especially considering that the overall average word-length in the entire book is 4. Therefore, investigator 2 would likely record more such units compared to investigator 1. However, this is an estimate and actual results may vary based on the specific book and its writing style.
