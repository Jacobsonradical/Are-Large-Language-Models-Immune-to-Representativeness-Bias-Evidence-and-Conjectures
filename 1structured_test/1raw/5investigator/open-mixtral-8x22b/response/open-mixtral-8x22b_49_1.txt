{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because an entire page's average word-length can be influenced by longer words in the body of the text, whereas a single line's average word-length is more likely to be affected by the presence of shorter words, especially if the line contains fewer words overall. Therefore, it would be less common for a page's average word-length to reach 6 or more than for a line's average word-length to do so.
