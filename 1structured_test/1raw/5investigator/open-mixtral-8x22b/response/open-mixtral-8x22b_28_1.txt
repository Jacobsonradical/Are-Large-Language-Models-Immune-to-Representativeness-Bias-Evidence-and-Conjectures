{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more pages/lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that the first line of a page is more likely to contain longer words, as it often sets the context or introduces a new topic. Additionally, the first line might be shorter in length and contain fewer words, making it easier to skew the average towards higher values with just a few long words. In contrast, pages with an average word-length of 6 or more would require a larger number of longer words spread throughout the page, which might be less common.
