{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page is more likely to contain longer words, such as headings or the first word of a sentence, which tend to be longer. Additionally, the smaller sample size of a single line compared to an entire page means that the presence of a few longer words can have a more significant impact on the average word-length. However, without more specific information about the book or the distribution of word-lengths, it is difficult to say for certain or estimate the difference between the two investigators' counts.
