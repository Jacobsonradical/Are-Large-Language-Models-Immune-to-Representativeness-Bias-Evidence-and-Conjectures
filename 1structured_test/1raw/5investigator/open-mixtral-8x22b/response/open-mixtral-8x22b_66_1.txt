{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reasoning behind this is that a line typically contains fewer words than a page, making it more likely for a line to have a higher average word-length.

Investigator 1's method of calculating the average word-length per page considers all the words on the page, which may lead to a more balanced average due to the larger sample size. This makes it less likely for a page to have an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to a single line.

However, this is an educated guess based on the information provided. The actual result could vary depending on the specific properties of the language used in the book and the structure of the sentences and paragraphs.
