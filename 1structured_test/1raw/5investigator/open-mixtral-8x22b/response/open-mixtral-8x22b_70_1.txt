{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. The main reason is that the first line of a page is often a title, heading, or the beginning of a new section, which tends to have shorter words or even abbreviations. This would result in a lower average word-length.

In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which includes a more diverse range of sentence structures and word lengths. Therefore, pages with an average word-length of 6 or more would be less common than lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

However, this is a probabilistic argument, and the actual outcome could vary depending on the specific content and layout of the book.
