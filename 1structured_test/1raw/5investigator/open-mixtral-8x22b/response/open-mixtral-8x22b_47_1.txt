{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reasoning behind this is that the first line of a page can vary in length and complexity, and it might contain longer words compared to the rest of the page. Therefore, it is more likely for the first line to have a higher average word-length than the entire page. This means that Investigator 2 would likely find more units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 1 finding entire pages with that average.
