{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more. The reason is that the average word-length of the entire book is 4, which is significantly lower than 6. This means that pages or lines with an average word-length of 6 or more are relatively rare. However, because Investigator 2 only considers the first line of each page, it's more likely to encounter a line with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1, who considers the entire page. This is because a single long line can more easily skew the average of a single line than the average of an entire page. Therefore, Investigator 2 is likely to record a larger number of such units.
