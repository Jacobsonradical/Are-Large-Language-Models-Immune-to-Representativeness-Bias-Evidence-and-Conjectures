{investigator: 2}

Reasoning:
Investigator 2, who computed the average word length of the first line in each page, is more likely to find a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who computed the average word length for entire pages. This is because the first line of a page may contain titles, subtitles, or other headings that tend to have longer words compared to the rest of the text on a page. Therefore, it is more likely for the first line to have a higher average word length compared to the entire page. Additionally, Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, while Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which means Investigator 1 has a larger sample size and is less likely to find pages with an average word length of 6 or more. Based on these factors, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units.
