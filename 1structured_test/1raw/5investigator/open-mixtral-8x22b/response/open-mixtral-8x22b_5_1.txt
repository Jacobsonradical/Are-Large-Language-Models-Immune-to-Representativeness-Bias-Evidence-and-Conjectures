{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of each page might contain headings, titles, or subheadings that are usually longer than the rest of the text, leading to a higher average word-length. On the other hand, investigator 1 considered the entire page, which could include shorter words or phrases, resulting in a lower average word-length. However, this is an estimation, and the actual result might vary depending on the specific content of the book.
