{investigator: 2}

Explanation:

Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page may contain fewer words than the full page, making it easier for the first line to have an average word-length of 6 or more. In contrast, the average word-length for an entire page would be influenced by a larger number of words, making it less likely for the page to have an average word-length of 6 or more. However, it is important to note that this is a probabilistic answer and the actual result could vary depending on the specific content and layout of the book being studied.
