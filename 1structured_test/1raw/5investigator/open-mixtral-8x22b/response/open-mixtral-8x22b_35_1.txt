{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page is more likely to contain longer words due to the formatting and typesetting of a book. Additionally, Investigator 1 is considering the average word-length of an entire page, which would be influenced by shorter words that might be present in other parts of the page. However, this is just an educated guess based on the information provided, and the actual result may vary depending on the specific book and its content.
