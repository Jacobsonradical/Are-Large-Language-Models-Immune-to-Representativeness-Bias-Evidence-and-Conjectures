{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more pages/lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reasoning behind this is that the first line of each page might contain more complex or longer words, such as headings or titles, which could increase the average word-length. On the other hand, entire pages might have a more balanced distribution of short and long words, making it less likely for the average word-length to reach 6 or more. However, this is an assumption based on the information provided, and the actual results might vary depending on the specific content and layout of the book.
