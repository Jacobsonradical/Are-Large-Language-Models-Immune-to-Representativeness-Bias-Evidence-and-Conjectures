{investigator: 2}

My reasoning for this is that the average word-length in the entire book is 4, which means that an average word-length of 6 or more is significantly higher than the overall average. It is less likely for entire pages to have an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to individual lines. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units.
