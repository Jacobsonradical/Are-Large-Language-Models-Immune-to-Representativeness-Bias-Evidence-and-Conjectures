{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page often contains fewer words compared to the entire page. As a result, the average word-length in the first line can be more easily skewed by a few long words. Therefore, we would expect to see more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to entire pages.
