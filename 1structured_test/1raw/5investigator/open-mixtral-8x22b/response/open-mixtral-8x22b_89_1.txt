{investigator: 2}

Explanation:

Assuming that the distribution of word-lengths is roughly the same in every line and page, Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that the first line in each page may contain fewer words compared to an entire page, making it easier for the average word-length in a single line to reach 6 or more.

On the other hand, an entire page would require a higher number of long words to reach an average word-length of 6 or more, making it less likely for a page to have such an average compared to a single line. Therefore, Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such units.

However, this is a simplification, and the actual outcome would depend on various factors such as the book's content, writing style, and page layout. Nonetheless, based on the information provided, Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
