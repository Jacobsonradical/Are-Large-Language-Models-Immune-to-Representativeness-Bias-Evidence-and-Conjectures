{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page can vary in length, and it may be shorter or longer than the average for the entire page. If there are longer words at the beginning of the page, the first line could have an average word-length of 6 or more, even if the rest of the page does not. Therefore, investigator 2 might find more instances of lines with a higher average word-length compared to investigator 1. However, this is a prediction and the actual outcome could vary based on the specific content of the book.
