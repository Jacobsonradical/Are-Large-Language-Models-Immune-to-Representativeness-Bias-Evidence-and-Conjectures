{investigator: 2}

Explanation:

It is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason behind this is that the first line of a page is more likely to contain shorter or longer words compared to the rest of the page. This is because the first line of a page often includes headings, titles, or subheadings, which can have a different word-length distribution than the rest of the text.

Moreover, even if there are pages with an average word-length of 6 or more, it is still possible that the first line of these pages has a lower average, as the rest of the page may contain longer words to balance out the shorter words in the first line.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. However, it is also possible that the two investigators recorded similar numbers, within 5% of each other, if the text is consistent throughout the book and does not have many variations in word-length distribution. Nonetheless, based on the information provided, the most likely answer is Investigator 2.
