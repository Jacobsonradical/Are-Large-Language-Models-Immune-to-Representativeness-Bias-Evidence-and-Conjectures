{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of such units. This is because the first line of a page might have a higher average word-length than the rest of the page. This could be due to the formatting of the book, where the first line might have fewer words but longer words, or it might have a higher concentration of longer words than the rest of the page. Additionally, Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which means they are looking at fewer words overall, making it more likely that those words will have a higher average word-length. Investigator 1, on the other hand, is looking at the entire page, which means they are looking at a larger number of words, making it less likely that those words will have a higher average word-length.
