{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of such units because they only considered the first line of each page. The first line often contains shorter words, such as titles, subtitles, chapter names, or the beginning of a new paragraph, which are typically shorter than the average word-length in the entire book. Therefore, pages with an average word-length of 6 or more would still have a higher likelihood of having a first line with an average word-length of less than 6.

Investigator 1, on the other hand, calculated the average word-length for the entire page, which means that even if a page had a few long words, the average could still be below 6 if the rest of the words were relatively short.

In summary, Investigator 2's method is more likely to capture pages with an average word-length of 6 or more in the first line, while Investigator 1's method is more likely to capture pages with a consistently high average word-length throughout the entire page. Given that pages with an average word-length of 6 or more are less common than pages with a first line with an average word-length of less than 6, Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of such units.
