{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason for this is that the first line of a page can contain fewer words than the entire page, and it is easier for a shorter line to have a higher average word-length. For example, a first line with only two words, each having a length of 6 or more, would have an average word-length of 6 or more. In contrast, a full page would need many more words with a length of 6 or more to achieve this average word-length. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 would find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 would find pages with that average word-length.
