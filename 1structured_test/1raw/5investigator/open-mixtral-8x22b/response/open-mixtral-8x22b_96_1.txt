{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page often contains shorter words, such as articles, conjunctions, and pronouns, which can lower the average word-length. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, where longer words may be more evenly distributed, making it less likely for a page to have an average word-length of 6 or more. Additionally, there are generally more lines than pages in a book, increasing the likelihood of observing a higher average word-length in lines compared to pages.
