{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of such units. The reason for this lies in the difference between the units of measurement used by the two investigators. Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, while Investigator 2 is looking at individual lines.

Since Investigator 2 is only considering the first line of each page, it stands to reason that this line might be more likely to contain longer words or fewer shorter words, thus increasing the average word length compared to the entire page. This is because the first line of a page could potentially be part of a longer sentence that spans multiple lines, and longer sentences often contain longer words. Additionally, the first line might contain fewer short function words (like "and", "the", "an") that lower the average word length.

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 recording pages with an average word length of 6 or more. It's less likely that they're about the same (within 5% of each other) due to the reasons stated above.
