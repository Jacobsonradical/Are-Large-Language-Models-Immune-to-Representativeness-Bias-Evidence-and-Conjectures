{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more units. The reason for this is that the first line of each page is more likely to contain shorter, introductory sentences or phrases, which would result in a lower average word-length when compared to the entire page. Therefore, it is less likely for the first line to have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the entire page. This would lead to Investigator 1 finding fewer pages with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 2 finding first lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
