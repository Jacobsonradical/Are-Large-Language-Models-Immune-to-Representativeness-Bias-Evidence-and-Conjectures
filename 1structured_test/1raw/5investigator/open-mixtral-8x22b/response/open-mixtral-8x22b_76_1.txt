{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reasoning behind this is that a single line is more likely to have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to an entire page, as a page would require a higher proportion of longer words to reach this average. Furthermore, the first line of a page might be more likely to contain longer words if it's a topic sentence or contains more descriptive or technical language. However, this is just an educated guess and the actual results may vary depending on the specific content and layout of the book.
