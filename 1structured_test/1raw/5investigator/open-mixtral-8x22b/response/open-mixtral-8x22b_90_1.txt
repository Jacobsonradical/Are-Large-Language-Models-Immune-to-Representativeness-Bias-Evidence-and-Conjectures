{investigator: 2}

I think that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. The reasoning behind this is that the first line of each page might contain headings, titles, or topic sentences which are generally longer than the average word length. This would result in many first lines having a higher average word length than entire pages. It is likely that the distribution of average word length for first lines in a page would be more skewed towards higher values than the distribution for entire pages.
