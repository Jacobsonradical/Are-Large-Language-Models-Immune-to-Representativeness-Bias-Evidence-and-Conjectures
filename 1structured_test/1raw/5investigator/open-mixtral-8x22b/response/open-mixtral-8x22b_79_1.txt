{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which may contain a mixture of shorter and longer words, thus making it less likely for the average word-length to be 6 or more. On the other hand, investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which may contain a more concentrated number of longer words, making it more likely for the average word-length to be 6 or more. Additionally, since there are likely more lines in the entire book than there are pages, investigator 2 has a larger sample size to work with, further increasing the likelihood of finding lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
