{investigator: 2}
Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page often contains shorter words (such as articles, pronouns, and prepositions), and the average word-length in these lines will be shorter than the average for the entire page. Therefore, when a line has an average word-length of 6 or more, it is more likely that the entire page also has a high average word-length. However, the opposite is not always true; a page with a high average word-length does not necessarily have a first line with an average word-length of 6 or more. Thus, Investigator 2 is likely to record more units with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1.
