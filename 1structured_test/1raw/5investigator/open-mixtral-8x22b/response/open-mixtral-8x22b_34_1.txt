{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more. The reason is that the first line of a page often contains less words than the entire page, and it's more likely for a smaller sample of words to have a higher average length. For example, a single long word in a short line will have a greater impact on the average than it would in a longer paragraph or page. However, without actual data, this is just an educated guess.
