{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is based on the assumption that the first line of each page is more likely to have a higher average word-length than the entire page. The first line often starts a new paragraph or topic, which might contain longer words or more complicated language, leading to a higher average word-length. Additionally, the first line is less likely to be influenced by shorter text often found at the end of a page, such as the start of a new paragraph or a subheading.
