{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more pages/lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that a line typically has fewer words than a page, making it more likely for a line to have a high average word-length. For instance, if a line has only two words and both are long, then the line's average word-length will be high. However, for a page to have a high average word-length, many of its words need to be long, which is less likely. Therefore, investigator 2 is more likely to find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than investigator 1 is to find pages with the same average word-length.
