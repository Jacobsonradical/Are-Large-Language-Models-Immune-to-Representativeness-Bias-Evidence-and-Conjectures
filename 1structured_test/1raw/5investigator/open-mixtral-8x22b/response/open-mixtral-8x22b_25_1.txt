{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more pages/lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

The reasoning behind this is that the first line of a page can contain significantly longer or shorter words than the rest of the page, depending on the content. For example, a page might have an average word-length of 4.5, but the first line could contain several long words that raise its average to 6 or more. However, it's less likely for an entire page to have an average word-length of 6 or more, as this would require a consistent use of longer words throughout the entire page. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to find a larger number of such units.
