{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Since the average word-length in the entire book is 4, having an average word-length of 6 or more is quite high. The first line of a page often contains fewer words than the rest of the page, and a higher word-length average in the first line would require fewer long words compared to a full page. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 would find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 finding pages with the same criteria.
