{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units because they only considered the first line of each page. The first line might contain a higher concentration of longer words due to the need to introduce new topics or ideas. Investigator 1, on the other hand, computed the average word-length for entire pages, which could potentially include lines with shorter words, thus reducing the overall average. However, this is a speculative answer based on the information provided, as the actual number of pages or lines with an average word-length of 6 or more could vary depending on the specific content and structure of the book.
