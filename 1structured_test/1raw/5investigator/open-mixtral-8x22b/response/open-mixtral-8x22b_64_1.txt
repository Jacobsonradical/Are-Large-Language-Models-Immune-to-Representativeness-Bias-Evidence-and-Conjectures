{investigator: 2}

Explanation:

Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that Investigator 2 only considers the first line of each page, which could contain fewer words and, therefore, be more easily skewed towards a higher average word-length than the entire page.

In contrast, Investigator 1 calculates the average word-length for the entire page, which includes more words and is likely to have a more stable and lower average word-length.

Moreover, the average word-length of the entire book is 4, which is lower than the threshold of 6. This suggests that pages and lines with an average word-length of 6 or more are relatively rare, further supporting the idea that Investigator 2's method would capture more of these instances.

However, it's important to note that this is a probabilistic analysis and the actual outcome could vary depending on the specific characteristics of the book.
