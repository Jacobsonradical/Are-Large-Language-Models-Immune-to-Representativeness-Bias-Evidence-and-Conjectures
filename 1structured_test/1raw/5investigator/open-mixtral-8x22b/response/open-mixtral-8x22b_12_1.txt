{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that the first line of a page often contains shorter words, such as articles (a, an, the) or prepositions (in, on, at), which can lower the average word-length compared to the rest of the page. By focusing only on the first line, Investigator 2 is more likely to find lines with a higher average word-length than the overall average for the page. This increases the likelihood that Investigator 2 will find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 will find pages with the same average word-length. However, it is important to note that this is a probabilistic answer and the actual outcome may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the book being analyzed.
