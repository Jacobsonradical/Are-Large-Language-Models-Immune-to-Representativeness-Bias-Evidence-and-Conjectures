{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of each page might contain more complex words or longer sentences, leading to a higher average word-length than the overall book average. Investigator 1 might find fewer pages with an average word-length of 6 or more since the entire page's average would be influenced by all sentences and paragraphs, making it less likely for pages to have an average word-length significantly higher than the book's overall average.
