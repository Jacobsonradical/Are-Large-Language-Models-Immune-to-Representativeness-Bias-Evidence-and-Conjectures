{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page is more likely to have shorter words compared to the average word length of the entire page. Therefore, it would require a greater deviation from the average for the first line to have an average word length of 6 or more compared to the entire page. This means that pages with an average word length of 6 or more would be rarer than lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
