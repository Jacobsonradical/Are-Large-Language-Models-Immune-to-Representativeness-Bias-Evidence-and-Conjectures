{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the average word-length of 4 for the entire book suggests that shorter words are more common. Therefore, it is less likely for a whole page to have an average word-length of 6 or more as compared to just a single line. However, this is a general assumption, and the actual number could vary based on the specific content and structure of the book.
