{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that the first line of each page might be more likely to have longer words due to the structure of sentences and paragraphs. The beginning of a paragraph often contains longer words, while the rest of the paragraph might have a mix of short and long words, evening out the overall average word-length on the page. However, this is a hypothesis based on my understanding of language patterns, and actual results may vary depending on the specific book and language used.
