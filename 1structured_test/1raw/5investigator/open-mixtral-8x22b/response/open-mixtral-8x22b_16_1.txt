{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reasoning behind this is that the first line of each page might not be representative of the entire page, and could potentially contain longer words. For example, the first line might contain a lengthy title or a longer sentence compared to the rest of the page. Therefore, it's more likely for the first line to have an average word-length of 6 or more than the entire page. However, this is just an educated guess based on the information provided.
