Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine which investigator recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. However, we can make an educated guess based on some assumptions.

One possible assumption is that the distribution of word-lengths in the book is relatively consistent, with some variation but no significant skew towards longer or shorter words. In this case, we might expect that the average word-length on a given page would be similar to the average word-length in the first line of that page. Therefore, the number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more would be roughly the same as the number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

However, there are other factors that could affect the results. For example, if the book contains a lot of long technical terms or jargon, the average word-length on pages containing those terms might be significantly higher than the overall average. Similarly, if the book contains a lot of short sentences or fragments, the average word-length in the first line of some pages might be lower than the overall average.

Without more information about the specific content and structure of the book, it is difficult to say for certain which investigator recorded a larger number of units. However, based on the assumption of a relatively consistent distribution of word-lengths, I would guess that the number of pages and lines with an average word-length of 6 or more would be roughly the same (within 5% of each other).

So my answer would be:

{investigator: 3}
