{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of such units. The reason is that the first line of a page can often contain shorter words, leading to a higher average word-length than the rest of the page. This is because the first line of a page usually starts a new paragraph, which often contains introductory words or phrases that are shorter in length. Therefore, it is more likely for the first line to have an average word-length of 6 or more than the entire page. Additionally, investigator 2 is only looking at one line per page, while investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which increases the chances of finding a higher average word-length. However, it is still possible for investigator 1 to record a higher number of such units if there are enough pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. But based on the given information, investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of such units.
