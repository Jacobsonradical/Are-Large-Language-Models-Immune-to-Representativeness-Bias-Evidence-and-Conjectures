{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because a single line can have a much higher variance in average word-length than an entire page. For example, a single line might contain several long words, while a page with the same average word-length is more likely to have a mix of shorter and longer words. Additionally, pages with a high average word-length might still have some lines with shorter words, while a line with a high average word-length is more likely to be consistently long.
