{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. The reasoning behind this is that the first line of a page might contain fewer words than the entire page, making it more likely to have an average word length of 6 or more if it contains longer words. In contrast, Investigator 1's method of calculating the average word length for the entire page might lead to a lower average due to the larger number of words and more variability in word length. However, this is a hypothesis, and actual results may vary depending on the specific content and structure of the book.
