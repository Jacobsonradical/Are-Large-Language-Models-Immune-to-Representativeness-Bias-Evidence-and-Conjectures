{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because individual lines within a page can have a higher variance in average word-length than entire pages. For example, a page may contain a mix of short and long words, resulting in an average word-length closer to 4. However, a single line may contain a higher concentration of longer words, resulting in an average word-length of 6 or more. Therefore, it is more likely for Investigator 2 to find a larger number of such units.
