{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more. The reasoning behind this is that the first line of each page is likely to contain shorter words due to formatting constraints (e.g., chapter titles, headings, etc.). However, since we're looking for pages or lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, it's more likely to find such lines in the first line of a page than in the entire page itself, as the average word-length for the entire page is more likely to be influenced by longer words, making it less likely to have an average of 6 or more.
