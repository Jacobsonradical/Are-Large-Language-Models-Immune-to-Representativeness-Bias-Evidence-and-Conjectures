{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. This is because the first line of a page may contain fewer words, and if they are all long words, the average word-length for that line can be significantly higher than the overall average of 4. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length for an entire page, which would require many more long words to achieve an average of 6 or more. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 will find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 will find pages with that average.
