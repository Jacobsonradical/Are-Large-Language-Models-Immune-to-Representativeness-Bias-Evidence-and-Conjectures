{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason for this is that the first line of a page is more likely to have longer words, as the author often uses the first line to introduce the topic or idea of the page, which requires more specific and longer words. Investigator 1, on the other hand, is looking at the average word-length for an entire page, which is likely to include shorter words used in the body of the text. Therefore, investigator 2 is more likely to find a larger number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. However, this is just a hypothesis and the actual results could be different based on the specific text being analyzed.
