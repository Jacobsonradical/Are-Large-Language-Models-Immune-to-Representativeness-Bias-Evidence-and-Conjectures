{investigator: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is as follows:

1. Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which includes a larger sample of words than Investigator 2, who is only looking at the first line of each page.
2. With a larger sample size, Investigator 1's results are more likely to be closer to the overall average word-length of the entire book, which is 4.
3. This means that Investigator 1 is less likely to find pages with an average word-length of 6 or more, as these pages would be considered outliers.
4. On the other hand, Investigator 2 is looking at a smaller sample size, which makes it more likely that some of the first lines will have an average word-length of 6 or more.
5. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 will record a larger number of such units.

However, it is important to note that this is not a guarantee, as the distribution of word-lengths in the book could vary in unpredictable ways. Nonetheless, based on the information provided, Investigator 2 is the most likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
