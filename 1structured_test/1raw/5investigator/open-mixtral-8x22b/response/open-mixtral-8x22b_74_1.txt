{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more because they only looked at the first line of each page. This line is more likely to have a higher average word-length than the entire page, as longer words are often found at the beginning of a page before the text breaks into shorter sentences or phrases. Additionally, the first line may contain titles or headings with longer words. This would lead to a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
