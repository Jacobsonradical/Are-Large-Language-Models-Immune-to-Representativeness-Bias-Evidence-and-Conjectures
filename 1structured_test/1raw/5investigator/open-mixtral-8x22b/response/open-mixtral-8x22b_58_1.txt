{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page can contain fewer words than the entire page, making it more likely to have a higher average word-length if it contains longer words. Additionally, if there are any pages that start with long words, those will be immediately counted towards Investigator 2's total, while Investigator 1 would need a higher concentration of long words throughout the entire page to reach an average of 6 or more.
