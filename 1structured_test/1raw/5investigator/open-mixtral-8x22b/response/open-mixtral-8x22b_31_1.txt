{investigator: 2}

Explanation:

Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of such units. This is because the average word-length of 6 or more is a relatively high threshold, and it is less common for an entire page to have such a high average word-length than it is for a single line to have such a high average word-length.

Additionally, the first line of a page may contain a higher average word-length than the rest of the page due to the presence of longer words or phrases that introduce the topic of the page. This could further increase the likelihood that Investigator 2 records a larger number of such units.

While it is possible that the two investigators' results are within 5% of each other, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
