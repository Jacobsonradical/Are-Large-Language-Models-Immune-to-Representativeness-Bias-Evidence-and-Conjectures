{investigator: 2}

My reasoning:

Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason for this is that the first line of a page often contains shorter words, such as articles, prepositions, and pronouns, which can lower the average word-length. However, there may also be lines in the middle or end of the page that have a higher average word-length due to longer words. Therefore, it is more likely that there will be a greater number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than there are pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because a single line can have a high average word-length without affecting the average word-length of the entire page.
