{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more pages/lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of each page may have a higher likelihood of containing longer words than the average word-length of the entire page. The first line might contain introductory phrases, headings, or titles, which often have longer words compared to the rest of the text. This could lead to a higher number of lines meeting the average word-length criteria of 6 or more compared to entire pages.
