{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more. The reason is that the first line of each page might have a higher average word-length than the entire page, as the first line could contain more complex or longer words. This results in a higher probability of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more in the first line compared to the entire page.
