{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The first line of each page is more likely to contain longer words due to the introduction of new topics or characters. Moreover, the average word-length for the entire book is 4, so it is less likely for an entire page to have an average word-length of 6 or more. However, it is still possible for specific pages to have a higher average word-length due to the nature of the content. Overall, I believe Investigator 2 would have recorded more such units.
