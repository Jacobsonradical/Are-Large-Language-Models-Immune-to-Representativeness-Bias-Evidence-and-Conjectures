{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units. The reason is that the first line of each page may contain fewer words than the entire page, making it easier for those lines to have a higher average word-length of 6 or more. In contrast, each page would have to contain many words with an average length of 6 or more to achieve the same average, which is less likely. Therefore, it is more probable that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units than Investigator 1.
