{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. This is because the first line of each page is more likely to contain shorter, introductory words or phrases, which would require more words of a longer length to achieve an average word-length of 6 or more. In contrast, Investigator 1 is considering the entire page, which would include a more diverse range of sentence structures and word lengths, making it less likely for each page to have an average word-length of 6 or more.
