{investigator: 2}

My reasoning is that Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of such units because they are only looking at the first line of each page. The first line of a page often contains shorter sentences or headings, making it more likely that the average word length will be shorter compared to the entire page. Consequently, it is less probable for the first line to have an average word length of 6 or more.

On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which may contain paragraphs with longer average word lengths. Therefore, it is more likely for Investigator 1 to find pages with an average word length of 6 or more. However, given the overall average word length of 4 in the book, such pages with an average word length of 6 or more would still be relatively rare, making it unlikely that Investigator 1 would record a significantly larger number of units compared to Investigator 2.

In summary, while it is possible for either investigator to record a larger number of such units, I think Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more, given that they are only looking at the first line of each page. However, it is also possible that the numbers recorded by the two investigators are relatively close to each other (within 5%), depending on the specific characteristics of the book and the distribution of word lengths within it.
