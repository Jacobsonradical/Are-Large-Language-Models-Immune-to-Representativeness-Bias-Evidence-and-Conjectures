{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line in each page may have a higher chance of containing longer words compared to the average word-length of the entire page. The first line might have more complex sentences or technical terms, which could increase its average word-length. Also, considering that Investigator 2 only looks at a single line per page, it is more likely to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who looks at the entire page. However, this is just an educated guess, as we don't have the actual data or details about the book's content.
