{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. Since the overall average word-length in the entire book is 4, it is more likely that shorter lines or lines containing shorter words are more common. Therefore, lines with an average word-length of 6 or more would be less frequent than pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.

However, this is just a probabilistic reasoning, and the actual outcome might vary depending on the specific book and its content.
