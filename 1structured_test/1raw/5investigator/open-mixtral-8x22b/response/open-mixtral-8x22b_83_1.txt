{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of such units. The reason is that the first line of a page often consists of shorter words due to the format of paragraph and sentence structures. Therefore, there's a higher chance that other lines in a page would have an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to the entire page having an average word-length of 6 or more. However, this also depends on the specific structure and content of the book.
