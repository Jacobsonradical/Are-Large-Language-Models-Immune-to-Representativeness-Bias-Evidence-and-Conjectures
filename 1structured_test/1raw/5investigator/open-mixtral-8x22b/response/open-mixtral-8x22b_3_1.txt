{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. The first line of each page might contain more lengthy words than the average word-length in the entire page. This is because the first line often contains a heading or the beginning of a paragraph, which might include longer words to introduce the topic or set the tone. On the other hand, Investigator 1 might not have found as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more because the average word-length in a whole page is affected by the presence of shorter words, which is more likely to occur throughout the entire page.
