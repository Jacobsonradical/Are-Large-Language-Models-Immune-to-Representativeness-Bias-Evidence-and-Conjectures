{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page can often contain shorter words, such as conjunctions, prepositions, and pronouns, which are common in the beginning of sentences. On the other hand, the entire page would have a more balanced distribution of word lengths, making it less likely to have an average word-length of 6 or more. Therefore, I would expect Investigator 2 to find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 finding pages with such an average.
