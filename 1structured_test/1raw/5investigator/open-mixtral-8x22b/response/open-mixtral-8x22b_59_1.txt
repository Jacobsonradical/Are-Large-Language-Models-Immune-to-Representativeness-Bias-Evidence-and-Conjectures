{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that the first line of a page often contains fewer words than the entire page, making it easier for the average word-length in that line to reach 6 or more. Since Investigator 2 only looked at the first line of each page, they were more likely to encounter lines with a higher average word-length.

On the other hand, Investigator 1 looked at the average word-length for entire pages, which means that the longer pages with more words would have a lower likelihood of having an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because it would require a larger number of long words to raise the average to 6 or more, which is less likely to occur.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. It is unlikely that the two investigators would have recorded numbers that were within 5% of each other, given the differences in their methods of calculation.
