{investigator: 2}

Explanation:

Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of such units. Here's why:

1. A line generally contains fewer words than a full page.
2. Since the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it would require fewer longer words in a line to raise its average word-length to 6 or more compared to a full page.
3. Therefore, it is more likely that the first line of a page would have an average word-length of 6 or more than an entire page having an average word-length of 6 or more.

Note: This answer assumes that the distribution of word-lengths is somewhat consistent throughout the book and that there are no anomalies such as entire pages filled with exceptionally long or short words.
