{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is likely to record a larger number of such units. This is because the first line of a page may contain fewer words than an entire page, making it easier to have a significantly higher average word-length. For example, a first line that contains only two words with lengths 7 and 5 would have an average word-length of 6, while a page with many words would require a more balanced distribution of short and long words to achieve an average word-length of 6 or more.
