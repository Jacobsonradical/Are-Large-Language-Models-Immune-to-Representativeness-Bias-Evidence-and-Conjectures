{investigator: 2}

Explanation: I think investigator 2 recorded more pages/lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that the first line of a page is more likely to contain shorter sentences or fragments, which could have a higher average word-length than the entire page. This is because longer sentences tend to be broken up into multiple lines, and shorter sentences or fragments are more likely to be found at the beginning of a page. Therefore, investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. However, this is just a hypothesis and the actual results may vary depending on the specific book and its formatting.
