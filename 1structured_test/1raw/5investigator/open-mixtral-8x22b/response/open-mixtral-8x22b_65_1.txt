{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of each page may contain a higher concentration of longer words, such as titles or headings, which could skew the average word-length of that line. In contrast, Investigator 1's method of calculating the average word-length for entire pages may be more balanced but less likely to reach an average of 6 or more due to the presence of shorter words throughout the page. However, this is just an educated guess and the actual results could vary depending on the specific content of the book.
