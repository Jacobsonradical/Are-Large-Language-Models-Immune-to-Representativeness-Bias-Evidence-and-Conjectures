{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more because the first line of a page is more likely to have a higher average word-length than the entire page. This is due to the fact that titles, headings, and the first few sentences of a paragraph often contain longer words. Therefore, the first line on a page is more likely to have an average word-length of 6 or more than an entire page.
