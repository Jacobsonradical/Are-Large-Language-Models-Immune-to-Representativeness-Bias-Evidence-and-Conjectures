{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. The reasoning behind this is that the first line of a page often contains shorter words, such as articles or prepositions, which could bring down the average word length. On the other hand, considering the whole page, the average word length might be closer to the overall book average of 4, making it less likely for pages to have an average word length of 6 or more. Therefore, it seems more probable that there would be more lines with an average word length of 6 or more compared to entire pages with the same average. However, this is an estimation and the actual outcome could vary depending on the specific characteristics of the book being studied.
