{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units. The reason is that investigator 1 computed the average word-length of entire pages, which may involve many lines, some with longer and some with shorter average word-lengths. This means that pages with an average word-length of 6 or more are likely to be relatively rare since they require many lines with high average word-lengths.

On the other hand, investigator 2 only computed the average word-length of the first line of each page. This means that any line with an average word-length of 6 or more is likely to be counted, regardless of the average word-length of the rest of the page. Since there are many lines on each page, and it is likely that at least some of them have a high average word-length, investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units.

However, it is important to note that this is just a prediction, and the actual numbers may vary depending on the specific properties of the book being studied.
