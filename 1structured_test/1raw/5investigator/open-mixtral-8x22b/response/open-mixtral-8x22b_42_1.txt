{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units. The reason is that the first line of a page often contains fewer words than the entire page. Therefore, it's more likely for a single long word to significantly increase the average word-length of the first line than that of the entire page.

This reasoning assumes that the distribution of word-lengths is more or less consistent across the book. However, the actual result may depend on the specific content of the book.

Given the information provided, it would be very difficult for investigator 1 to record a larger number of such units, unless there are specific pages with extremely long words or a high concentration of longer words. Even then, it seems less probable than the scenario described for investigator 2.

It is highly unlikely that they are about the same (within 5% of each other), given the reasons mentioned above.
