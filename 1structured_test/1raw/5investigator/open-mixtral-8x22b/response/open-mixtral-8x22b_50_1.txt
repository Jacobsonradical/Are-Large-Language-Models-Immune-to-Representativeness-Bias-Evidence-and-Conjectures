{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more such units.

The reasoning behind this is that the first line in each page could potentially contain more words than the overall average word-length of the entire page. This is because the first line can be composed of longer words that are not representative of the average word-length of the page. Additionally, considering that Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length for entire pages, it is less likely that a page would have an average word-length of 6 or more, as this would require a significant number of longer words throughout the entire page. In contrast, Investigator 2 only needs to find one line in each page with an average word-length of 6 or more, which seems more probable given the variability in word-lengths across the book.
