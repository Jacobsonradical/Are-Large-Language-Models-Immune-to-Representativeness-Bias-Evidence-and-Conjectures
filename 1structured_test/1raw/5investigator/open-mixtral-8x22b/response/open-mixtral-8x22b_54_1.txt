{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of each page is more likely to contain shorter, introductory sentences, and the likelihood of having an average word-length of 6 or more in these lines is lower compared to entire pages.

However, the fact that the overall average word-length is 4 suggests that longer words are spread throughout the book. So, there will be some pages with an average word-length of 6 or more, but these will be less frequent than lines with that average.

Therefore, Investigator 2 is expected to have a larger count, and it's less likely that they will be within 5% of each other.
