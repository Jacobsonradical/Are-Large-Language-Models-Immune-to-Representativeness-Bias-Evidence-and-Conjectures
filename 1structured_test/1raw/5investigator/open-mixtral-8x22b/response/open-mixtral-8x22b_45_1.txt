{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here's why:

1. The average word-length in the entire book is 4, which means that a significant number of words are likely shorter than 6 characters.
2. A group of shorter words can easily bring down the average word-length of a page, even if a few words are longer than 6 characters. However, a single line with mostly long words can easily have an average of 6 or more characters per word.
3. The first line in each page might contain headings, titles, or subheadings, which are often longer than the average word-length in the rest of the text. This increases the likelihood of the first line having a higher average word-length.
4. Since Investigator 2 only looks at the first line of each page, they are more likely to encounter lines with a higher average word-length than Investigator 1, who looks at the entire page.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. However, this is just a prediction based on the information provided, and the actual results can vary depending on the specific properties of the book being studied.
