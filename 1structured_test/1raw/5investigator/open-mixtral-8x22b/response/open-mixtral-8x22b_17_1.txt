{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. The reasoning behind this is that the first line of each page is more likely to have a higher average word-length due to the presence of longer words such as titles, headings, or the first words of a new paragraph or section. Additionally, a single line having an average word-length of 6 or more does not significantly impact the overall average word-length of an entire page. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 would find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 finding pages with the same average word-length.
