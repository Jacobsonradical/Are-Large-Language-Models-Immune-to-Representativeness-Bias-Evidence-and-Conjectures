{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more such units. This is because investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which typically contains fewer words than an entire page. If one or two long words appear in the first line, it could easily skew the average word length for that line to 6 or more. In contrast, investigator 1 is looking at the average word length for entire pages, making it less likely for the average to reach 6 or more, as the longer words are spread out over more words in total.
