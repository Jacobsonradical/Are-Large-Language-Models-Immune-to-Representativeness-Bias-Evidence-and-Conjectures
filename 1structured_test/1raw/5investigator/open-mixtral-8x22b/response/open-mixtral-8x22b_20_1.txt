{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.

The reasoning is based on the fact that the first line of a page often contains fewer words than the entire page, making it more susceptible to variations in average word length. For instance, if the first line contains only a few long words, its average word length could easily exceed 6, while a whole page would require a larger number of long words to achieve the same average.

Since Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, it would be less likely for the average word length to exceed 6 unless a significant number of words on that page were longer than average. On the other hand, Investigator 2 is looking at individual lines, which are more likely to have a higher average word length due to the smaller sample size.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such units. However, this is a probabilistic argument and the actual outcome could vary depending on the specific content of the book.
