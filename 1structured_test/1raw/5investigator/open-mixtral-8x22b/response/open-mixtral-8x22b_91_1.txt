{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line in each page might have a higher average word-length due to the presence of longer words like titles, headings, or section descriptions. On the other hand, investigator 1 considers the entire page, which may include shorter words in the body of the text, resulting in a lower average word-length. However, this is just an educated guess based on the information provided, and the actual outcome could vary depending on the specific content and layout of the book.
