{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more pages or lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which may contain shorter words than the rest of the page, making it more likely to have a higher average word-length. Investigator 1, on the other hand, is looking at the entire page, which may include longer words that bring down the average word-length. Therefore, it is more likely that investigator 2 will find more units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
