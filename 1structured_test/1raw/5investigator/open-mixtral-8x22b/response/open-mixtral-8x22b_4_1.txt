{investigator: 2}

Explanation:

Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of such units. This is because the first line of each page may contain more shorter or longer words due to the layout of the page and the typesetting. For instance, the first line might contain more longer words if the page starts with a new section or paragraph, or it might contain more shorter words if it's the continuation of a paragraph from the previous page. By focusing on the first line of each page, Investigator 2 is more likely to encounter lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length for the entire page. This means that any shorter or longer words will be distributed across the entire page, and their impact on the average word-length will be less pronounced. Therefore, Investigator 1 is less likely to encounter pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Of course, this is just a general trend, and the actual results may vary depending on the specific book and its layout. However, based on the information provided, Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of such units.
