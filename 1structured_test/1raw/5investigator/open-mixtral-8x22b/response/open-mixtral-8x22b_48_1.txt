{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. Here's my reasoning:

First lines of pages often contain headers, titles, or shorter sentences that can have a higher average word-length due to fewer words per line. This means there's a higher chance for the first line to have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to a full page's average, which is influenced by a larger sample of words.

However, this is an estimation based on typical book formatting and language patterns, and the actual outcome may vary depending on the specific book and its writing style.
