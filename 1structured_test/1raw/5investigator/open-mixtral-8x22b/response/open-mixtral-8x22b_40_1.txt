{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because a single line is more likely to have a higher average word-length than an entire page, given that there are fewer words on a line than on a page. The average word-length for the entire book is 4, but this doesn't mean that every line or page has exactly this average. Some lines or pages may have a higher average word-length, while others may have a lower average. The distribution of word-lengths is likely to be more variable for individual lines than for entire pages. Therefore, it is more probable that Investigator 2 will find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 will find pages with the same average word-length.
