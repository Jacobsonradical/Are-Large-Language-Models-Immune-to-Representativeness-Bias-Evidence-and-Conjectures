{investigator: 1}

Explanation:

Investigator 1 is more likely to record a larger number of such units because they are considering the entire page, while Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page. A page with a high average word-length will likely have a first line with a high average word-length, but a first line with a high average word-length does not guarantee a high average word-length for the entire page. Therefore, Investigator 1 is more likely to find pages with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 2.
