{investigator: 2}

The reasoning for this is that Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which could potentially contain shorter or longer words than the rest of the page. This means that there is a higher chance for any given line to have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to an entire page, where the average is more likely to be closer to 4. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 will record a larger number of such units.
