{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more units. The reason for this is that the first line of each page might contain more shorter words compared to the rest of the page, leading to a higher average word-length for that line. For example, the first line might contain a large number of articles (a, an, the) or prepositions (in, on, at) which are shorter than other words. Additionally, the first line might have fewer longer words, such as nouns or verbs, further increasing the average word-length. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
