{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. The reasoning behind this is that the first line of each page can vary greatly in terms of word length, as it can be a single word, a short phrase, or a long sentence. This variability increases the chances of having a higher average word-length for the first line. In contrast, Investigator 1 is considering the average word-length of an entire page, which would be less likely to deviate significantly from the overall average word-length of 4 and reach an average word-length of 6 or more.
