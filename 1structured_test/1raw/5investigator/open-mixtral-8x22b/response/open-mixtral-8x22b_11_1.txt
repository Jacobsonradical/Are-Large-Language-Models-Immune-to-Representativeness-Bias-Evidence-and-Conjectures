{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. The reason for this is that the first line of a page often contains shorter words, such as titles, headings, or the initial words of a paragraph. Therefore, it is more likely for a page's average word-length to be 6 or more than for the first line's average word-length to be 6 or more. This discrepancy would lead to Investigator 2 having a smaller number of such units compared to Investigator 1. However, since the question asks for a comparison between the two investigators, we can infer that Investigator 2 would still have a larger number of such units when compared to Investigator 1.
