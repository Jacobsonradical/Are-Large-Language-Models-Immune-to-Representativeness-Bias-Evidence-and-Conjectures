Given the limited information provided and the lack of specific details about the book (such as the total number of pages, lines per page, and the distribution of word lengths), it's challenging to make an accurate prediction. However, I can provide a logical explanation based on the available information:

Assuming that the average word length in the entire book is 4, it suggests that most pages and lines will have an average word length close to 4. Therefore, it will be relatively less common to find pages or lines with an average word length of 6 or more.

Investigator 1 is looking at the average word length for each page, so any page with a substantial number of longer words or fewer short words could have an average word length of 6 or more.

On the other hand, Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which typically contains fewer words than an entire page. To achieve an average word length of 6 or more, the first line would need to have a higher proportion of longer words than a full page would.

Based on these considerations, it might be more likely for Investigator 1 to find pages with an average word length of 6 or more than for Investigator 2 to find lines with the same average. However, this is not a definitive conclusion, and the actual numbers could vary depending on the specific characteristics of the book.

That being said, my best guess, based on the information provided, is that Investigator 1 might have recorded more pages with an average word length of 6 or more than Investigator 2 recorded lines.
