{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more. The reasoning behind this is that the average word-length for the entire book is 4, which means that most pages and lines will have an average word-length close to 4. However, lines tend to have more variance in their average word-length than entire pages, as a single long or short word can have a significant impact on a line's average but less so on a page's average. Therefore, it is more likely that we would find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than entire pages with such an average.
