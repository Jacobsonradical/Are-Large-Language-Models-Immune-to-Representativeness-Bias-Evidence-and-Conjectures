{investigator: 2}

I think investigator 2 recorded more. The reasoning behind this is that the first line of each page is likely to contain shorter words due to the formatting and structure of the text. For example, the first line often starts with a short word such as "The", "A", or "In". However, there may be a few pages where the first line has a longer average word length, leading to a higher count for investigator 2.

On the other hand, investigator 1 is looking at the average word length for the entire page. It's less likely for a whole page to have an average word length of 6 or more, as the longer words would need to be balanced out by many shorter words on the same page to maintain the overall average word length of 4 for the book.

Therefore, investigator 2 is likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages investigator 1 finds with the same criteria. It's unlikely they are about the same within 5% of each other.
