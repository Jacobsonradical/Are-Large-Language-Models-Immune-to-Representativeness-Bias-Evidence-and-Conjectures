{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. The reasoning behind this answer is that the first line of each page might be more likely to contain longer words than the average for the entire page. This could be due to the fact that the first line often starts with a topic sentence or a more complex sentence structure, which might include longer words. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 would find a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 finding pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
