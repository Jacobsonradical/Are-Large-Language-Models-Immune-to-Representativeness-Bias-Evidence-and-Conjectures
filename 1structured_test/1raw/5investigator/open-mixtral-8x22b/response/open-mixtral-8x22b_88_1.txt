{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. The reasoning behind this is that the first line of each page is likely to have a higher average word-length compared to the overall page average. This is because the first line often contains longer, more complex sentences that set the context for the rest of the paragraph or section, whereas subsequent lines may contain shorter words or phrases. Therefore, it's more probable that the first line of a page will have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the average word-length of the entire page.
