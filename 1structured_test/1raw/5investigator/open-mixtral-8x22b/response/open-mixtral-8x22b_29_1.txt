{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more pages or lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which may contain longer words as the first line often sets the context or topic of the paragraph. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which may include a mix of longer and shorter words, thus making it less likely for the average word-length to reach 6 or more. However, this is just a hypothesis and the actual result would depend on the specific content and structure of the book.
