{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because a single line can have a higher average word-length than an entire page. Even if a page has a few long words, the average for the page might not reach 6, while a line containing mostly long words can easily have an average word-length of 6 or more. However, the exact answer depends on the specific distribution of word lengths in the book, which is not provided in the question.
