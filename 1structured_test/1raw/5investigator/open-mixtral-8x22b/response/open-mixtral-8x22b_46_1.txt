{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded more pages/lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that the first line of each page is likely to have a more varied word-length than the entire page. For example, a page might have a mix of short and long words that average out to 4 letters, but the first line could still have a higher average word-length if it contains more long words. Additionally, the first line of a page might be more likely to contain longer words if it is the beginning of a new paragraph or section. However, it's important to note that this is just a hypothesis, and the actual results could vary depending on the specific book being studied.
