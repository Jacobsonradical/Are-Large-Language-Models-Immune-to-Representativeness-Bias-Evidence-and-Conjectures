{investigator: 2}

Explanation:

Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only considering the first line of each page, which may contain a smaller sample size of words and thus be more susceptible to outliers (i.e., words with significantly higher or lower word-lengths). This could result in a higher frequency of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

In contrast, Investigator 1 is calculating the average word-length for entire pages, which will likely have a larger sample size of words. This larger sample size could mitigate the effect of outliers and result in fewer pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 will record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
