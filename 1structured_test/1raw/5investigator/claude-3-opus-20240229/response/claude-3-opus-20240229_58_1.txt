To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of the average word-length in each unit.

Investigator 1 looked at the average word-length of entire pages. Since a page contains many words, the average word-length is less likely to deviate significantly from the overall average of 4. Extreme values on a page (very long or very short words) will have less impact on the page's average.

Investigator 2 looked at the average word-length of the first line on each page. A line contains fewer words than a page, so the average word-length of a line is more susceptible to extreme values. If a line contains even a few long words, it can significantly increase the line's average word-length.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of such pages recorded by Investigator 1.
