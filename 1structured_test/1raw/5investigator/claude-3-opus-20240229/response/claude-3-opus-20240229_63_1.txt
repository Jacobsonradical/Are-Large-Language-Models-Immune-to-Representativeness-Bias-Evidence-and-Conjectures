Let's think about this step-by-step:

1) The average word length for the entire book is 4. This means that overall, the word lengths tend to be around 4.

2) Investigator 1 is looking at the average word length per page. Since a page contains many lines, the average word length per page is likely to be closer to the overall average of 4. Deviations from this average will be less extreme because the longer and shorter words will balance out over the page.

3) Investigator 2 is looking at the average word length per line. A line is a smaller unit than a page, so the average word length per line is more likely to deviate from the overall average. A single line might contain a few very long or very short words, skewing its average.

4) Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to find lines with an average word length of 6 or more, because the averages of smaller units (lines) are more variable than the averages of larger units (pages).

So my answer is:

{investigator: 2}
