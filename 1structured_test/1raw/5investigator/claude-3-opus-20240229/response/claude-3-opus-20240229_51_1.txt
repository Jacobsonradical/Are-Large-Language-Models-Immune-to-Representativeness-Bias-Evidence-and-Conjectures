Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 computed the average word length over entire pages. Since each page contains many lines and words, the average will tend to even out and converge towards the overall book average of 4. It would be relatively rare for a full page's average to deviate significantly from this mean and reach 6 or higher.

In contrast, Investigator 2 only looked at the first line on each page to compute the average. A single line contains far fewer words than a full page. With a smaller sample size, there will be higher variability in the averages. Some first lines will happen to contain a cluster of longer words, pushing the line average to 6 or above more frequently than for full pages.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of units (lines) meeting the criteria of an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of units (pages) recorded by Investigator 1.
