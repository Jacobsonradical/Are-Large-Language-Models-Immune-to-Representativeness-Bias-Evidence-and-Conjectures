Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length across entire pages. Since each page contains many lines and words, the average word length per page is likely to be fairly close to the overall book average of 4. There will be some variation from page to page, but most pages will probably cluster around that mean, with few pages deviating significantly higher or lower.

In contrast, Investigator 2 looked at just the first line on each page. A single line is a much smaller sample size than a full page. With a smaller sample, there is likely to be much more variability in the average word length from line to line. Some first lines may have many short words, pulling the average well below 4. Other first lines may have several longer words, pushing the line average to 6 or higher.

With more variability expected in the line-level data, Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines meeting the "6 or more" criterion compared to the number of such pages found by Investigator 1.

Therefore, my answer is:

{investigator: 2}
