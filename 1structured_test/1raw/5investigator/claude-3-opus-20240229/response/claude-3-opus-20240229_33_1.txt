Here is my analysis:

The average word length across the entire book is 4. This means that pages with an average word length of 6 or more are outliers on the high end. There are likely relatively few pages that deviate that much above the overall average.

In contrast, individual lines can vary much more in their average word length. Even on a page with an average word length close to 4, the first line could easily have a high concentration of longer words, pushing its average to 6+. There is more variability line to line than page to page.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines with 6+ average word length compared to the number of 6+ pages recorded by Investigator 1. The line-level data allows for more outliers.

In summary:
{investigator: 2}
