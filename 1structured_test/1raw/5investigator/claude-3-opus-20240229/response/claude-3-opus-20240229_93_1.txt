Here is my analysis:

The average word length across the entire book is 4. This means that pages with an average word length of 6 or more are relatively rare, since they are significantly above the overall average.

However, individual lines within a page can more easily have high average word lengths, since a single line is a much smaller sample size than a full page. Even if the page average is around 4, some lines on that page could have longer words that push their individual averages up to 6+.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2, who looked at the first line of each page, likely found more instances of an average word length >= 6 compared to Investigator 1 who averaged the entire page.
