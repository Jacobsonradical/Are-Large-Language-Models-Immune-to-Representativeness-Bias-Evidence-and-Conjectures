To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of the data within pages and lines.

Since the average word-length for the entire book is 4, it's more likely for a single line to deviate significantly from this average compared to an entire page. A page contains multiple lines, so the variability in average word-length among pages will be less than the variability among individual lines.

Therefore, Investigator 2, who considered individual lines, is more likely to have encountered a higher number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who considered entire pages.
