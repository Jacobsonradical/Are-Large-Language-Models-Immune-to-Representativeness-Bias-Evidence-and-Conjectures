Here is my analysis:

The average word length over the full page will be less variable than the average word length of a single line on each page. A single line is a much smaller sample size and thus the average word length per line will have higher variance.

With an overall average of 4 letters per word, an average word length of 6 or more represents a significant deviation. This is much more likely to occur for a single line on a page than for the full text on the page.

Therefore, Investigator 2, who looked at the average word length of the first line on each page, likely recorded more instances of an average â‰¥6 compared to Investigator 1 who averaged over all words on each page.
