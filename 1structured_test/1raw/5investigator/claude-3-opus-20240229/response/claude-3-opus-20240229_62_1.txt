Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length across each full page. Since a page contains many lines and words, the average word length per page is likely to be fairly close to the overall book average of 4. There may be some variation page to page, but most pages will probably have an average word length between 3 and 5, with few pages averaging 6 or higher.

In contrast, Investigator 2 only considered the first line on each page. A single line is a much smaller sample size than a full page. With a smaller sample, there is likely to be more variation in the average word length line by line. Some first lines may have many short words, pulling the average below 4. Others may have several longer words, pushing the line average to 6 or higher. 

So while the page averages will tend to cluster around the overall mean of 4, the line averages will be more spread out, with a larger percentage reaching 6 or above. Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 probably recorded more instances of a 6+ average compared to Investigator 1.
