Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length over entire pages. Since pages contain many lines, the average word length will tend to converge towards the overall book average of 4 words per page. There will be some variation page to page, but relatively few pages will deviate significantly from the mean and have an average of 6+ words.

In contrast, Investigator 2 looked at individual lines. A single line is a much smaller sample size than a full page. Therefore, the average word length will vary more from line to line compared to page to page. Some lines will have many short words, pulling the average down, while other lines will have longer words, pulling the average up. More lines will hit the 6+ word average threshold.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 will record a larger number of lines meeting the 6+ word average compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
