To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of word-lengths within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page. Since a page contains many words, the variability of the average word-length per page is likely to be lower due to the larger sample size. Extreme values (very short or very long words) will have less impact on the page average.

Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. A line contains fewer words than a page, so the variability of the average word-length per line is likely to be higher. Extreme values will have a greater impact on the line average.

Given that the overall average word-length in the book is 4, it is more likely that a single line will have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to an entire page. Therefore, Investigator 2 is expected to have recorded more units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more.
