Here is my analysis:

The average word length across the entire book is 4. This means that on average, pages will also tend to have an average word length close to 4. There may be some variation, with some pages having a higher or lower average, but overall the averages will cluster around the book average of 4.

In contrast, individual lines can vary much more in their average word length. A line could easily have several long words, pushing its average to 6+. Or it could have many short words, lowering the average. There is more potential variability in the average word length of single lines.

With this higher variability, it's more likely that Investigator 2 found a larger number of lines with an average of 6+ compared to the number of 6+ pages found by Investigator 1. The average of a page will regress more towards the mean of 4, while line averages can deviate further.

Therefore, my conclusion is:

{investigator: 2}
