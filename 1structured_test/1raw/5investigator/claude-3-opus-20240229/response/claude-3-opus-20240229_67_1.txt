To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of word-lengths within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page. Since a page contains many words, the average word-length for a page is less likely to deviate significantly from the overall average of 4.

Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. A line contains fewer words than a page, so the average word-length for a line is more likely to deviate from the overall average.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
