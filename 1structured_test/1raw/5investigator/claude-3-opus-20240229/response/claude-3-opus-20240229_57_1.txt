{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page, while Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page.

Since the overall average word-length in the book is 4, it's more likely that a single line on a page will deviate significantly from this average compared to the average of all the words on the entire page.

In other words, the average word-length of a page is more likely to be closer to the book's overall average of 4, as it includes many words that can balance out the longer and shorter words. In contrast, a single line is more prone to having an average word-length that differs substantially from the book's average, as it contains fewer words and thus has a higher variability.

Therefore, Investigator 2, who considered only the first lines, is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who considered the average word-length of entire pages.
