Here is my analysis:

The key insight is that there will be more variability in the average word length across individual lines compared to across whole pages. A page contains many lines which will tend to average out to the overall book mean of 4 letters per word.

However, any given line may by chance have a concentration of longer or shorter words that causes its average to deviate significantly from the overall mean. Some lines will have many short words like "a", "an", "the", "and", etc. pulling the average down. Other lines may have a sequence of longer multisyllabic words pulling the average up.

When you look at individual lines, the variability in average word length will be high. When you average across a whole page with many lines, that variability gets smoothed out.

Therefore, Investigator 2 who looked at individual lines will find a higher number and percentage exceeding an average of 6 letters. The page averages that Investigator 1 measured will cluster more tightly around the book mean of 4.

In summary, my answer is:

{investigator: 2}
