To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or higher, we need to consider the variability in word-length within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 looked at the average word-length of entire pages. Since a page contains many lines and words, the average word-length is likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4. Deviations from this average will be less extreme due to the larger sample size per unit (page).

Investigator 2 looked at the average word-length of single lines. A line contains fewer words than a page, so the average word-length of a line is more likely to deviate from the overall book average. Some lines may have many short or long words, leading to more extreme averages.

Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, as the smaller sample size per unit (line) allows for more variability.
