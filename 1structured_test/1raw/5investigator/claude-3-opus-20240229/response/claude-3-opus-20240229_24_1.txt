Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length across each full page. Since a page contains many words, the average word length per page is likely to be fairly close to the overall book average of 4. There will be some variation, but most pages will probably have an average word length somewhere between 3.5 and 4.5. It would be fairly uncommon for a full page average to deviate as high as 6.

In contrast, Investigator 2 only looked at the first line on each page. A single line contains far fewer words than a full page. Due to the smaller sample size, there will be more statistical variance in the average word length per line. Some lines may have mostly short words and an average below 4, while other lines may have a few very long words that push the line average up to 6 or higher. 

So in summary, by looking at smaller sample sizes, Investigator 2 is more likely to find units (lines) with an average of 6+ compared to Investigator 1 looking at whole pages. Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 probably recorded a larger number of lines meeting that 6+ criteria compared to the number of 6+ pages found by Investigator 1.
