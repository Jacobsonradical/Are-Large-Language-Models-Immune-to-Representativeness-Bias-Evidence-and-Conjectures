To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length within pages and lines.

Pages contain more words than lines, so the average word-length in a page is less likely to deviate significantly from the overall book average of 4. In contrast, lines have fewer words, so there's a higher chance of finding lines with average word-lengths that differ from the book average.

Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 2, who examined individual lines, found a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who looked at entire pages.
