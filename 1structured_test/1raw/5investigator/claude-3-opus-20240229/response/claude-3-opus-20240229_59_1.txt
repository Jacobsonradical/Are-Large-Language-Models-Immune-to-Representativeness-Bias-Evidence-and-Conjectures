Here is my analysis:

The average word length over an entire page is likely to be closer to the overall average of 4 compared to the average word length of a single line. A page contains many lines which will tend to balance out shorter and longer words.

However, a single line is a much smaller sample size. There is more likely to be variability in the average word length line to line. Some lines may have many short or long words that deviate significantly from the overall average.

Therefore, I expect Investigator 2, who looked at individual lines, found more instances of lines with an average word length of 6 or greater compared to the number of pages with average word length over 6 found by Investigator 1.
