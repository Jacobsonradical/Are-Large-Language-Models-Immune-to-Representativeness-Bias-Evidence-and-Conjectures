To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of word-lengths within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each full page. Since a page contains many words, the average word-length per page is likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4. Extreme values on individual lines are likely to be balanced out within a page.

Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. A line contains fewer words than a page, so there is more room for variability. Some first lines may have significantly longer or shorter words than the book's average.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of such pages recorded by Investigator 1.
