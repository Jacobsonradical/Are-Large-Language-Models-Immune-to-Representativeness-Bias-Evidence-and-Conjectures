Here's my analysis:

The average word length across the entire book is 4. This means that on average, pages will also tend to have an average word length close to 4, since pages contain many lines which will average out.

However, individual lines can more easily deviate from the overall average, since they contain fewer words. A line with a couple long words can have a high average, even if the rest of the page has shorter words.

Therefore, I expect more individual lines to have an average ≥6 compared to entire pages. Sampling just the first line on each page will likely find more instances of high average word length compared to averaging all lines on each page.

So in conclusion, I believe Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines with average word length ≥6 compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
