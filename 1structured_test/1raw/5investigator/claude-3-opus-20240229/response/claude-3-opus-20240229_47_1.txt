Let's think about this step by step:

1. The average word length in the entire book is 4. This means that across all pages and lines, the average word length is 4.

2. Investigator 1 computed the average word length for each page. Since a page contains multiple lines, the average word length per page is likely to be closer to the overall average of 4.

3. Investigator 2 computed the average word length for the first line of each page. A single line is a much smaller sample size compared to a full page. This means that the average word length per line is more likely to deviate from the overall average of 4.

4. Given that the investigators are counting the number of units (pages for Investigator 1, lines for Investigator 2) that have an average word length of 6 or more, Investigator 2 is more likely to find such units. This is because the smaller sample size (a single line) allows for more variability in the average word length.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
