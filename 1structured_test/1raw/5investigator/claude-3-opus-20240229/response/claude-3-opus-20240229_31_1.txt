To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of word-lengths within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page. Since a page contains many words, the average word-length is likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4. Extreme values (very long or very short words) will have less impact on the page average.

Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. A line contains fewer words than a page, so the average word-length of a line is more susceptible to extreme values. If a line contains a few very long words, it can significantly increase the line's average word-length.

Given that the overall book average is 4, it is more likely that individual lines will deviate further from this average compared to entire pages. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more.
