Here is my analysis:

The key insight is that there will be more variability in the average word length across individual lines compared to full pages. A page contains many lines which will tend to average out closer to the overall mean of 4 words per page.

However, an individual line is a much smaller sample and thus can more easily deviate significantly from the mean just by chance. For example, a line with a few long words can easily have an average over 6, even if the full page it's on averages to 4.

Therefore, Investigator 2, who looked at individual lines, likely found a higher number of samples meeting the "6 or more" criteria compared to Investigator 1 who looked at the averages of entire pages.
