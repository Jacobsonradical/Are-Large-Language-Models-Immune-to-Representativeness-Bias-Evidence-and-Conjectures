To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of word-lengths within a page compared to a single line.

A single line is more likely to have higher variability in average word-length compared to an entire page. This is because a page contains many lines, and the average word-length across the page will tend to be closer to the overall book average due to the larger sample size.

In contrast, a single line may have a few long words that significantly increase its average word-length, or it may have mostly short words, leading to a lower average.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2, who considered individual lines, would find more units with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who considered entire pages.
