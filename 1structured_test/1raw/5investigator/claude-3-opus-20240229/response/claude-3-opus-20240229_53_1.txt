Here is my analysis:

The key insight is that the variation in average word length will be greater across individual lines compared to full pages. A page contains many lines which will tend to average out closer to the overall book mean of 4 letters per word.

However, any given line could easily have several longer or shorter words that deviate significantly from the mean. There will be more variability in the average word length line by line.

Therefore, Investigator 2 who looked at the first line of each page will find a larger number of lines with 6+ letter averages compared to the number of 6+ letter average pages found by Investigator 1.

In summary:
{investigator: 2}
