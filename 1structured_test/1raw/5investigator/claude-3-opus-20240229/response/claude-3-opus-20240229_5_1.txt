Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length over entire pages. Since each page contains many lines, the average word length per page will tend to converge towards the overall book average of 4. It would be relatively uncommon for the average of a whole page to deviate significantly above 6.

In contrast, Investigator 2 looked at the average word length of just the first line on each page. A single line is a much smaller sample size than a full page. The average word length of individual lines will vary much more from the overall mean of 4. There will be a higher proportion of lines that have an average word length of 6 or more compared to pages.

Therefore, Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines meeting the criteria compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
