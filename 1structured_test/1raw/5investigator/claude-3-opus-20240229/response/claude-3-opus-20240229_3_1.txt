Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. The average word-length for the entire book is 4. This means that, on average, each word in the book is 4 characters long.

2. Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page. Pages are fairly large units of text, and each page likely contains a substantial number of words. With a larger sample size, the average word-length per page is more likely to be close to the overall average of 4.

3. Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. Lines are much smaller units of text compared to pages. The average word-length in a single line is more likely to deviate from the overall average due to the smaller sample size.

4. Given that the overall average is 4, it is less likely for a whole page to have an average word-length of 6 or more, as it would require many words longer than 4 characters to offset the shorter words and raise the average significantly.

5. However, it is more likely for a single line to have an average word-length of 6 or more, as it would only require a few longer words in that particular line.

Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to the number of such pages recorded by Investigator 1.
