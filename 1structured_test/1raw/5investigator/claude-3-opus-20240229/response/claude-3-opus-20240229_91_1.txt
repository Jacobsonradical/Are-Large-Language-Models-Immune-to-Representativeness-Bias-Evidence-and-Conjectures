To determine which investigator likely recorded a larger number of units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length within the pages and lines.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for entire pages. Since a page contains many words, the average word-length is likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4. Extreme values (very long or very short words) will have less impact on the page average.

Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. A single line contains fewer words than a full page, so the average word-length of a line is more susceptible to extreme values. If a line contains a few very long words, it can significantly increase the average word-length for that line.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
