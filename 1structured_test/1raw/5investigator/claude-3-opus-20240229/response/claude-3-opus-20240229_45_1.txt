Here is my answer:

{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages with that average word length recorded by Investigator 1.

My reasoning:
- The average word length across the entire book is 4. This means pages with an average word length of 6+ are outliers on the high end.
- A single page contains multiple lines. For the page average to reach 6+, a significant portion of lines on that page would need to have very long average word lengths.
- In contrast, for Investigator 2, any individual line on any page that happens to have long words can qualify as a 6+ average word length line, even if the rest of the lines on the same page have shorter words.
- This gives Investigator 2 more chances to find individual high average lines spread throughout the book, while Investigator 1 needs whole pages where the long-word lines concentrate together.

So in summary, I expect the 6+ average word length condition to be met more often for individual lines than for entire pages, giving Investigator 2 the higher count. The line-level average can vary more widely than the page-level average.
