Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 computed the average over entire pages, while Investigator 2 only used the first line of each page.

A page contains many lines and many words. The average word length over the whole page is likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4. It's less likely for the average of an entire page to deviate substantially from the mean.

In contrast, a single line contains fewer words. The average word length of a single line is more likely to fluctuate from the overall mean. With fewer words, each individual word length has a bigger impact on the line average. Some first lines will happen to have many long or short words, making the average deviate more from 4.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 likely recorded more lines with an average of 6+ compared to the number of 6+ pages recorded by Investigator 1. The line-level averages are more volatile.
