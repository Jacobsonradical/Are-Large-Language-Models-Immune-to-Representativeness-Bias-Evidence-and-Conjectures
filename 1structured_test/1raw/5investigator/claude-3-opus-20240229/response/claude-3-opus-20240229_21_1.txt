Here is my answer:

{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines with average word length of 6 or more compared to the number of such pages recorded by Investigator 1.

My reasoning:
- The average word length across the entire book is 4. For a full page to have an average of 6+, there would need to be a significant number of longer words to offset the more common shorter words and bring the average up that much.
- In contrast, since Investigator 2 only looked at the first line of each page, there is more potential variability. The first line is a smaller sample that could more easily have a high average word length just by chance.
- Over many pages, it's more likely to find individual lines that deviate strongly from the overall average of 4, compared to finding full pages that deviate that much. The law of large numbers suggests full pages will converge more to the mean.

So in summary, I expect Investigator 2's approach of analyzing individual lines allows for more variability and makes it more likely they found a greater number of lines with 6+ average word length. Let me know if this explanation makes sense!
