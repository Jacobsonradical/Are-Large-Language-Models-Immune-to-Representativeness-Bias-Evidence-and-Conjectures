To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of word-lengths within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 looked at the average word-length of entire pages. Within a page, there can be a mix of longer and shorter words, which tends to average out closer to the overall book average of 4.

Investigator 2 looked at the average word-length of single lines. A line is a smaller sample size than a full page, so there's more potential for variability. Some lines may have mostly long words, while others have mostly short words.

With the overall average being 4, it's more likely for a single line to have an average word-length that significantly deviates from this mean compared to a full page.

Therefore, Investigator 2 probably recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of such pages recorded by Investigator 1.
