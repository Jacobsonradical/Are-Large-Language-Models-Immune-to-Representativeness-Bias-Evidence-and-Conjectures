To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of the data within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 looked at the average word-length of entire pages. Since a page contains multiple lines, the variability of the average word-length per page will be lower than the variability of the average word-length per line. This is because the extreme values (very short or very long words) will be balanced out within a page.

Investigator 2 looked at the average word-length of single lines. Each line is a smaller sample size compared to a full page, so the average word-length per line will have higher variability. This means there's a higher chance of finding lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Given that the overall average word-length in the book is 4, it's more likely that Investigator 2 found a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages with the same average word-length found by Investigator 1.
