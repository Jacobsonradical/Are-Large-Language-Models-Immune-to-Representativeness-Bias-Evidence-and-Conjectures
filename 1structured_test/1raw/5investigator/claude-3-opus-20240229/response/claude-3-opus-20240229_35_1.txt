To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length within pages compared to the variability across the entire book.

Given:
- The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
- Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page.
- Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page.

The variability of average word-length is likely to be higher across individual lines than across entire pages. This is because pages contain more words, and the average word-length is more likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4.

In contrast, single lines may have a higher chance of deviating from the overall average due to the smaller sample size. Some lines may contain a higher proportion of longer words, resulting in more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Therefore, Investigator 2, who considered individual lines, is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who considered entire pages.
