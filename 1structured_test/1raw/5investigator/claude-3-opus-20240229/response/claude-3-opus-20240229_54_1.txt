To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length within pages and lines.

Given:
- The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
- Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page.
- Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page.

Reasoning:
1. Since the overall average word-length is 4, we expect fewer pages and lines to have an average word-length of 6 or more.
2. A page contains multiple lines, so the average word-length for a page is likely to be closer to the overall average of 4, as the variability in word-length among lines within a page will tend to balance out.
3. On the other hand, a single line is more likely to deviate from the overall average, as it represents a smaller sample size and may contain longer or shorter words by chance.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2, who computed the average word-length for the first line of each page, recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who computed the average word-length for each page.
