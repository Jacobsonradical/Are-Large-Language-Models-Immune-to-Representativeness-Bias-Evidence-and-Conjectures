Here is my analysis:

The average word length across the entire book is 4. This means that on average, pages will also tend to have an average word length close to 4. There may be some pages with higher or lower averages, but most will cluster around the overall book average of 4.

In contrast, the average word length of individual lines is likely to have much higher variability. Since a line is a much smaller unit than a page, the law of large numbers has less of an effect in causing the line average to converge to the overall book average. We would expect to see many more lines that deviate significantly from the book average of 4.

Therefore, Investigator 2, who looked at individual lines, likely encountered a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more compared to the number of such pages found by Investigator 1.

In summary, my answer is:

{investigator: 2}
