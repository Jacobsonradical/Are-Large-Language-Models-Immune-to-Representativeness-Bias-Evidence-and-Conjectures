Here is my analysis:

The average word length over the entire book is 4. This means that pages with an average word length of 6 or more are relatively rare, since 6 is significantly higher than the overall average of 4.

However, individual lines can more easily have a high average word length, since a line is a much smaller sample size than a full page. With a smaller sample, there is more variability and it's more likely to get high or low averages that deviate from the overall mean.

Therefore, I expect that Investigator 2, who looked at individual lines, found more lines with an average of 6+ compared to the number of 6+ pages that Investigator 1 found.
