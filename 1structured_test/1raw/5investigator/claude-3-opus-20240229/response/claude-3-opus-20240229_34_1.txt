Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 averaged the word lengths across entire pages, while Investigator 2 averaged over single lines. Since pages contain many lines, the law of large numbers suggests that the average word length per page will tend to be closer to the overall book average of 4.

In contrast, individual lines are much shorter samples and will show higher variability in average word length. Some lines may contain a few very long words, pushing the line average over 6. Other lines may have only short words.

Therefore, I expect Investigator 2 found a larger number of lines exceeding an average word length of 6 compared to the number of pages exceeding that average for Investigator 1.
