Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length across entire pages. Since each page contains many lines and words, the average word length per page is likely to be fairly close to the overall book average of 4. There will be some variation page to page, but likely not a huge amount.

In contrast, Investigator 2 only looked at the first line on each page. A single line is a much smaller sample size than a full page. With a smaller sample, there is likely to be more variability and deviation from the overall mean. Some first lines may have many short or long words by random chance.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 probably recorded a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6+ compared to the number of 6+ pages recorded by Investigator 1. The individual lines have more sampling variability than the full pages.
