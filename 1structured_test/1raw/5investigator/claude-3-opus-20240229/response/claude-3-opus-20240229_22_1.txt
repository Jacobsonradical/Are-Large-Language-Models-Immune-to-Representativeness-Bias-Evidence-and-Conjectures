To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of the data within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page. Since a page contains multiple lines, the variability of the average word-length across pages is likely to be lower than the variability across individual lines. This is because the extreme values (very long or very short words) within a page are more likely to balance out when averaged over the entire page.

On the other hand, Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. Individual lines are more likely to have extreme average word-lengths because they contain fewer words compared to a full page. This means that the variability of the average word-length across lines is likely to be higher than the variability across pages.

With higher variability, it is more likely for individual lines to have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to full pages. Therefore, Investigator 2 is expected to have recorded more units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 (pages).
