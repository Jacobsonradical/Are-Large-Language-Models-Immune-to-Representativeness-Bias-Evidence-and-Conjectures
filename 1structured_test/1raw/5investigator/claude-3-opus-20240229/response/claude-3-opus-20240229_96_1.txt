To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of word-lengths within a page compared to the variability across the entire book.

Given:
- The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
- Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page.
- Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page.

Reasoning:
- The average word-length of an entire page is likely to be closer to the book's overall average of 4, as it includes more words and thus has less variability.
- The average word-length of a single line is more likely to deviate from the overall average, as it contains fewer words and is more susceptible to variability.
- Therefore, Investigator 2, who considered only the first line of each page, is more likely to encounter lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who considered entire pages.
