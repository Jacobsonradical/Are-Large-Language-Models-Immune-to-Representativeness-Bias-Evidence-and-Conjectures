To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 looked at the average word-length of entire pages. Since a page contains many words, the average word-length is likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4. It would be less common for a whole page to have an average word-length of 6 or more.

Investigator 2 looked at the average word-length of single lines. A line contains fewer words than a page, so there is more potential for variability. Some lines may have many long words, while others have mostly short words. This means there is a higher chance of finding lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Therefore, Investigator 2 likely recorded more units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 (pages).
