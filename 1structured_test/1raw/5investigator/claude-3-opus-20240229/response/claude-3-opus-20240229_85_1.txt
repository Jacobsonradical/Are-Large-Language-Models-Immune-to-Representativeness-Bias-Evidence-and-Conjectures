Based on the information provided, I believe that Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of such pages recorded by Investigator 1. The reason is that individual lines can have more variability in average word-length compared to entire pages, which tend to average out closer to the overall book's average of 4.
