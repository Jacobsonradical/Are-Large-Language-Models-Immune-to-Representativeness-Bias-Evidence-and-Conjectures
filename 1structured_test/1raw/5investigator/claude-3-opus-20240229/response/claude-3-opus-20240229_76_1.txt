To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of word-lengths within pages and lines.

Given:
- The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
- Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page.
- Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page.

Reasoning:
- A page contains multiple lines, so the average word-length of a page is likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4, as the variability of word-lengths within a page tends to balance out.
- A single line is more likely to deviate from the overall book average, as it contains fewer words and is more susceptible to the influence of individual words with more or fewer letters.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2, who considered individual lines, recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who considered entire pages.
