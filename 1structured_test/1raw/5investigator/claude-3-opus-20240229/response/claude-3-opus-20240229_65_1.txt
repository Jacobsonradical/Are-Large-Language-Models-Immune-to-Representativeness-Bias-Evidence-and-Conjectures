Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 calculated the average word length over entire pages. Since pages contain many lines and words, the average will tend to be closer to the overall book average of 4. It would be relatively rare to have a page average that deviates significantly from this (e.g. 6 or more).

In contrast, Investigator 2 calculated the average word length for just the first line on each page. Individual lines will show much higher variability in average word length compared to full pages. By chance, some first lines will contain a cluster of longer words, resulting in an average of 6 or more.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6+ compared to the number of 6+ pages recorded by Investigator 1.
