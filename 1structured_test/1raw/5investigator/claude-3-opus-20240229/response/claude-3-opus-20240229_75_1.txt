Here is my analysis:

The average word length over the entire book is 4. This means there will be some variability on individual pages and lines around this average.

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length per page. Since a page contains many lines and words, the average word length per page is likely to be fairly close to the overall book average of 4. There will be some pages above and below, but fewer will diverge significantly from the mean.

Investigator 2 looked at just the first line on each page. A single line contains fewer words than a full page. With a smaller sample size, there is likely to be more variability in the average word length per line. More lines are likely to diverge significantly above or below the overall mean.

Therefore, Investigator 2 probably found more lines with an average word length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages with that average that Investigator 1 found. The average of a smaller sample tends to be more variable.

So my answer is:

{investigator: 2}
