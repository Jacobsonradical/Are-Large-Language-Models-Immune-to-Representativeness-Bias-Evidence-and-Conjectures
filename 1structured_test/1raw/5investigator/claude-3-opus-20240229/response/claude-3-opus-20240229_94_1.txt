To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of word-lengths within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 looked at the average word-length of entire pages. Since a page contains many words, the average word-length is less likely to deviate significantly from the overall average of 4. Extreme values will be balanced out by the larger sample size.

Investigator 2 looked at the average word-length of single lines. A line contains fewer words than a page, so the average word-length of a line is more likely to deviate from the overall average. Some lines may have many long words, while others may have mostly short words.

Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1's number of units (pages).
