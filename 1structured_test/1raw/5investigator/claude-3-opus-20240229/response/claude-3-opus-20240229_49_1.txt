Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length across entire pages. Since the overall average word length for the book is 4, relatively few pages are likely to have an average word length of 6 or more. Most pages will average out closer to the overall mean.

Investigator 2 looked at just the first line of each page. There is likely to be more variability in the average word length from line to line compared to full pages. Some first lines may have many longer words, pushing the average over 6. Other first lines may have mostly short words. But overall, more first lines are likely to exceed an average of 6 compared to full pages.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 probably recorded a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6+ compared to the number of 6+ pages recorded by Investigator 1.
