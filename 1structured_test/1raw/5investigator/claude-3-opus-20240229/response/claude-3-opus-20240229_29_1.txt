To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length within pages compared to the variability across the entire book.

Given:
- The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
- Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page.
- Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page.

Since the average word-length for the entire book is 4, it is likely that the majority of the pages will have an average word-length close to 4. However, within each page, there can be more variability in the word-length from line to line.

The first line of each page, which Investigator 2 analyzed, may not be representative of the entire page's average word-length. It is more likely that the first line of a page could have an average word-length of 6 or more, as it is a smaller sample size compared to the whole page.

Therefore, Investigator 2, who counted the number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, likely recorded a larger number of such units compared to Investigator 1, who counted the number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
