To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in the data.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page, which likely contains multiple lines and many words. The average of a larger sample size tends to be closer to the overall mean of 4, as the variability is reduced when averaging more data points.

On the other hand, Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. A single line has fewer words than a full page, so the average word-length of a line is more likely to deviate from the overall mean of 4 due to higher variability in smaller sample sizes.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
