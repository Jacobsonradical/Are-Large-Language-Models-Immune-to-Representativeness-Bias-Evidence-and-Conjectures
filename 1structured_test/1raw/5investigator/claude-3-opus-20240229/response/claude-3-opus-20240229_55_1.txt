Here is my analysis:

{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines with average word length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages with average word length of 6 or more recorded by Investigator 1.

The key is that the average word length across the entire book is 4. So for a full page to have an average word length of 6 or more is quite far from the overall average. It would require consistently longer words throughout the page to bring the average up that high. 

In contrast, since Investigator 2 only looked at the first line of each page, there is more variability. Even if the page average is close to 4, the first line could easily have several longer words that bring its individual average to 6+, without impacting the full page average much.

So in summary, the smaller sample size of a single line allows for more variability and deviation from the mean compared to the larger sample of a full page. Therefore, Investigator 2 measuring line averages likely found more instances exceeding the 6 word average threshold compared to Investigator 1 looking at full page averages.
