To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of the data within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each full page. Since a page contains multiple lines, the variability of the average word-length across pages is likely to be lower than the variability across individual lines. This is because the extreme values (very short or very long words) within a page are more likely to balance out when considering the entire page.

On the other hand, Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. Individual lines are more likely to have greater variability in average word-length because they contain fewer words compared to a full page. A single line might have several long words or several short words, leading to a higher or lower average word-length than the overall book average.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
