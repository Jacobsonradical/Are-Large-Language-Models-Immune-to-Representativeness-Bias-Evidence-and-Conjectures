Here is my analysis:
Investigator 1 computed the average word length over an entire page, while Investigator 2 only looked at the first line of each page. A full page of text will contain more words and thus the average will tend to converge closer to the overall book average of 4.

In contrast, a single line is a much smaller sample size. The average word length in a given line is more likely to deviate significantly from the overall average. Some first lines will happen to contain a greater proportion of longer words, pushing the average to 6 or above.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines with average word length >= 6 compared to the number of such full pages recorded by Investigator 1.
