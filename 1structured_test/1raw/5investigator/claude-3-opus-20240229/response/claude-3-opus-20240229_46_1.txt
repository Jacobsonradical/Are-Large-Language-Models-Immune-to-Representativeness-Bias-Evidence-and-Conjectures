Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 computed the average word length over entire pages. Since a page contains many words, the average will tend to be close to the overall book average of 4. There will be some variation from page to page, but relatively few pages will deviate as high as an average of 6+ words.

In contrast, Investigator 2 computed averages using only the first line of each page. A single line contains fewer words, so there will be more variability in the averages. Some first lines will happen to contain mostly longer words, pushing the line average to 6+. Other first lines will have mostly short words. 

So in summary, the line-level averages used by Investigator 2 will show more variability and more frequent high/low values compared to the page-level averages of Investigator 1 that will cluster closer to the overall mean.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 will record a larger number of lines with 6+ average word length compared to the number of 6+ pages recorded by Investigator 1.
