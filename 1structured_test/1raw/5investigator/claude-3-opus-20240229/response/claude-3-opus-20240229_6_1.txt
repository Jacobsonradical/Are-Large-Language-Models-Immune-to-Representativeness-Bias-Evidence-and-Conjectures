Here is my analysis:

The average word length over the entire book is 4. This means that pages with an average word length of 6 or more are relatively rare, since they are significantly above the overall average.

However, looking at just the first line of each page is a much smaller sample size. Individual lines are more likely to deviate significantly from the overall average, in both directions. So there will likely be a fair number of first lines that happen to have an average word length of 6+, even though the page average is lower.

Therefore, Investigator 2, who looked at only the first lines, probably found more units (lines) meeting the 6+ average word length criteria compared to Investigator 1 who averaged the entire page.
