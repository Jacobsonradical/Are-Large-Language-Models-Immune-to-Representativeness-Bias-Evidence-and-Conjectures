Here is my response in the requested format:

{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more recorded by Investigator 1.

The key insight is that there will be more variation in average word length between individual lines than between full pages. A page contains many lines, so the average word length of a full page will tend to be closer to the overall book average of 4.

In contrast, a single line is a much smaller sample size, so it's more likely for individual lines to have average word lengths that deviate significantly from the book average, including more lines with averages of 6+.

Therefore, I expect Investigator 2 found a higher number of lines meeting the 6+ threshold compared to the number of pages found by Investigator 1. The two counts are unlikely to be within 5% of each other.
