Here is my analysis:

The average word length across the entire book is 4. This means that pages with an average word length of 6 or more are relatively rare outliers with significantly longer than typical words.

However, even on a typical page with an average word length around 4, it's quite possible that the first line could have an average word length of 6 or more just by random chance. A single line is a much smaller sample size than a full page.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2, who looked at just the first lines, likely found a higher number of samples meeting the "6 or more" criteria compared to Investigator 1 who averaged the full pages. The high variability in single lines means more will cross that threshold just by chance.

In summary:
{investigator: 2}
