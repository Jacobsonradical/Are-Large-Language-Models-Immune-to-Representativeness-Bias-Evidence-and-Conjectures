To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of the average word-length in each unit.

Investigator 1 looked at the average word-length of entire pages. Since a page contains many words, the average word-length is less likely to deviate significantly from the overall average of 4. The law of large numbers suggests that as the sample size (number of words) increases, the sample mean (average word-length) tends to approach the population mean (book's average word-length).

Investigator 2 looked at the average word-length of single lines. A line contains fewer words than a page, so the average word-length of a line is more likely to deviate from the overall average. With a smaller sample size, there is more variability in the sample mean.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
