Here is my analysis:

The average word length over the entire book is 4. However, the word lengths will vary from line to line and page to page.

A full page of text will typically contain multiple paragraphs and many lines. So the average word length in a full page is more likely to be close to the overall book average of 4, since the larger sample size in a full page will tend to even out high and low variations between individual lines.

In contrast, a single line of text is a much smaller sample. The average word length in a single line is more likely to deviate substantially from the overall book average. Some lines will have many short words and fall well below an average of 4, while other lines may have several long words and have an average above 6.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2, who looked at individual lines, probably found a larger number of samples meeting the criteria of having an average word length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 who looked at full pages.
