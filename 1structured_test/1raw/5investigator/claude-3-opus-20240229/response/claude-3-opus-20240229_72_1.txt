Here is my analysis:

The key is that investigator 1 looked at the average of entire pages, while investigator 2 looked only at the first line of each page.

Since the overall average word length of the book is 4, most pages will likely average close to that. It would be unusual for a full page's average to deviate too much from the overall book average. So investigator 1 probably found relatively few pages with an average word length of 6 or more.

However, individual lines can vary much more in their average word length compared to the book average. The first line of a page could easily have longer or shorter words on average than the full page. So investigator 2 likely found many more lines that met the 6+ word average criteria compared to the number of qualifying full pages found by investigator 1.

Therefore, I believe investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units (lines) meeting the criteria compared to investigator 1 (pages).
