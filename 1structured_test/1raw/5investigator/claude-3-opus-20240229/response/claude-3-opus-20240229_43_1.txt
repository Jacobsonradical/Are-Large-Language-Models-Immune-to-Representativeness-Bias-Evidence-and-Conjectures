To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length across the book.

Given that the average word-length for the entire book is 4, it is more likely that individual lines will deviate further from this average compared to entire pages. This is because pages contain more words, and the variability in word-length tends to even out over a larger sample size (i.e., the law of large numbers).

In other words, investigator 2, who computed the average word-length for the first line of each page, is more likely to encounter lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. Conversely, investigator 1, who computed the average word-length for entire pages, is less likely to find pages with an average word-length of 6 or more, as the variability is reduced when considering a larger number of words per unit.

Therefore, my answer is:

{investigator: 2}
