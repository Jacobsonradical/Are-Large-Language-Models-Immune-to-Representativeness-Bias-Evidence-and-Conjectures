Here is my response in the requested format:

I believe Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines with average word length ≥6 compared to the number of such pages recorded by Investigator 1.

The key insight is that averaging tends to reduce variance and pull values towards the mean. Since a page contains many lines, the average word length per page will tend to be closer to the overall book average of 4. There will be relatively few pages that deviate far enough to have ≥6 average word length.

In contrast, a single line is a much smaller unit, so the average word length of individual lines will have higher variance. More lines will deviate significantly from the mean, with some lines having much higher or lower average word length. So a greater number of lines are likely to meet the ≥6 threshold compared to pages.

Of course, this depends on the actual word length distributions in the book, but in general, I expect Investigator 2's line-level analysis to find more cases of ≥6 average word length compared to Investigator 1's page-level analysis.
