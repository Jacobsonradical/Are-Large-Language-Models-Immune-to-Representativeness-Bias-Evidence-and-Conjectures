To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of word-lengths within a page compared to a single line.

A single line is more likely to have greater variability in average word-length compared to a full page. This is because a page contains many lines, and the variability of word-lengths across lines tends to balance out when averaging over the entire page.

In contrast, a single line may have a few very long or very short words that significantly affect its average word-length. This means that there is a higher probability of finding individual lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to finding entire pages with the same average.

Therefore, Investigator 2, who computed the average word-length for the first line of each page, is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who computed the average word-length for each full page.
