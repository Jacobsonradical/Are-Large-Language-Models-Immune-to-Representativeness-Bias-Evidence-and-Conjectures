To determine which investigator likely recorded a larger number of units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of word-length within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 looked at the average word-length of entire pages. Since a page contains many lines and words, the average word-length is more likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4. Extreme values (very long or very short words) will likely balance out within a page.

Investigator 2, however, only considered the first line of each page. A single line is more likely to have greater variability in average word-length compared to a full page. Some first lines may have many long words, while others may have mostly short words.

Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to encounter lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, as the variability is higher for single lines compared to full pages.
