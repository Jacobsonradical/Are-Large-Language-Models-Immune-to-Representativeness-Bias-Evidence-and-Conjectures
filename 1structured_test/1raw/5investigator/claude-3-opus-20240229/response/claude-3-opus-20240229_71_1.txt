To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of the average word-length within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page, which likely contains many lines. The average word-length of a page is less likely to deviate significantly from the overall book average of 4, as the larger sample size (more words per page) tends to reduce variability.

Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. A single line has fewer words compared to a full page, which means the average word-length of a line is more likely to deviate from the overall book average due to higher variability.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
