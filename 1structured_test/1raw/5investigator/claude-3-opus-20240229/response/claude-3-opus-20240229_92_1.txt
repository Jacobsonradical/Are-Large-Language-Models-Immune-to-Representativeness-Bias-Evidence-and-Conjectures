To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of the average word-length in each unit.

Investigator 1 considers the average word-length of an entire page, while Investigator 2 only looks at the first line of each page. A single line is more likely to have a higher variability in average word-length compared to a full page, as the page average will be more stable due to the larger sample size (more words).

This means that Investigator 2, who only considers the first line of each page, is more likely to encounter lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, as the variability in a single line is higher.

Therefore, my answer is:

{investigator: 2}
