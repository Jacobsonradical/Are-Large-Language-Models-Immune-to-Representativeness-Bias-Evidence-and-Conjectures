Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length over entire pages. Since pages contain many words (likely hundreds), the average word length per page will tend to be close to the overall book average of 4. It would be fairly uncommon for a page's average to deviate substantially from this mean.

Investigator 2 looked at the average word length of only the first line on each page. Individual lines contain far fewer words than full pages. Due to the smaller sample size, the average word length of single lines is more likely to vary substantially from the book's overall average. Some first lines will have many short words, others many long words, just by chance.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 likely recorded more lines with an average word length of 6+ compared to the number of 6+ pages recorded by Investigator 1. The average of a smaller sample (single lines) is more likely to deviate from the population mean compared to larger samples (full pages).
