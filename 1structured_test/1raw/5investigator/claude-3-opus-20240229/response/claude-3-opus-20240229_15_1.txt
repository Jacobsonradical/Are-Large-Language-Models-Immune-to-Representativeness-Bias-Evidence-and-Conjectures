To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length across pages and lines.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page. Since a page contains multiple lines, the variability in average word-length across pages is likely to be lower than the variability across individual lines.

Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. A single line is more likely to have extreme values (either high or low) compared to a full page, which averages out the word-lengths of multiple lines.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
