To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length across the book.

Given:
- The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
- Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page.
- Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page.

Reasoning:
1. A page contains multiple lines, so the average word-length of a page is likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4, as the variations in word-length across lines within a page will tend to balance out.

2. A single line is more likely to deviate from the overall book average, as it represents a smaller sample size. Some lines may have many short or long words, leading to a higher or lower average word-length.

3. Since the average word-length of a line is more likely to deviate from the book average compared to a page, Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Therefore, Investigator 2 likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1.
