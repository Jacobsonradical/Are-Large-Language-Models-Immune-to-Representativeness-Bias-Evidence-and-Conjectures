Here is my analysis:

The average word length across the entire book is 4. This means that on average, pages will tend to have an average word length close to 4. There may be some variation, with some pages a bit higher or lower, but most pages will be in the 4-5 range on average.

However, looking at just the first line of each page allows for more variability. A single line is a much smaller sample size than a full page. So while the average across all first lines will still tend towards 4, there is more room for individual lines to deviate further from this average. Some first lines may have longer words and an average length of 6+, while others may have mostly short words.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2, who looked at the average word length of the first line on each page, likely found more instances of an average of 6+ compared to Investigator 1 looking at the average of full pages. The smaller sample size of single lines allows for more variability and deviations from the overall average.
