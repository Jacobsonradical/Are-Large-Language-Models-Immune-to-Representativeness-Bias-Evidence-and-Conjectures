To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length within pages compared to the variability across the entire book.

Given:
- The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
- Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page.
- Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page.

Reasoning:
- The average word-length of an entire page is likely to be closer to the book's overall average of 4, as it includes more words and the variability is likely to be smoothed out over the larger sample size.
- The average word-length of a single line is more likely to deviate from the book's overall average, as it has a smaller sample size and is more susceptible to variability.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
