To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or higher, we can consider the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page, which typically contains several lines of text. By the central limit theorem, the distribution of page averages will be closer to the overall book average of 4, with less variability.

Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. A single line is a much smaller sample size compared to a full page. By the law of large numbers, the averages of these smaller samples (lines) are likely to have higher variability and deviate more from the overall book average.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
