Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length across entire pages. Since the overall book average is 4 words per page, for a page to have an average of 6 or more, there would need to be a significant number of long words to bring the average up that high. Full pages will tend to regress to the mean of 4 words per page.

Investigator 2 looked at only the first line of each page. Individual lines will have higher variance in average word length than full pages. With a smaller sample size of words, it's more likely to get lines that skew high or low compared to the book average. More lines will have averages of 6+ words compared to full pages.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 will record a larger number of lines meeting the 6+ word average criteria compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
