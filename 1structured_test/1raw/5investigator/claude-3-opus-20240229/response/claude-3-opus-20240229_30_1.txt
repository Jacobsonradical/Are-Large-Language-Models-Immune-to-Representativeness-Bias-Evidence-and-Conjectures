Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length across entire pages. Since each page contains many lines and words, the average word length per page is likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4. There will be some variation page to page, but most pages will probably have an average word length relatively close to 4.

In contrast, Investigator 2 looked at just the first line on each page. A single line is a much smaller sample size than a full page. The average word length in a single line is more likely to vary substantially from the overall book average. Some first lines may have many short or long words by chance, causing the line average to deviate significantly from 4.

Therefore, by looking at a smaller sample (single lines) that allows more variability, Investigator 2 is more likely to find instances of lines with an average word length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 looking at full page averages.
