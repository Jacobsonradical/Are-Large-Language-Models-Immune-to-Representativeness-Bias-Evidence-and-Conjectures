Let's think through this step-by-step:

1) The average word length for the entire book is 4. This means that across all pages and lines, the average word has 4 letters.

2) Investigator 1 is looking at the average word length per page. A page contains many lines, and therefore many words. With a larger sample size per unit (page), the average word length per page is less likely to deviate significantly from the overall average of 4.

3) Investigator 2 is looking at the average word length of the first line of each page. A line contains fewer words than a page. With a smaller sample size per unit (line), the average word length per line is more likely to deviate significantly from the overall average of 4.

4) Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to find lines with an average word length of 6 or more, because there's more variability in the averages of smaller samples.

So my answer is:

{investigator: 2}
