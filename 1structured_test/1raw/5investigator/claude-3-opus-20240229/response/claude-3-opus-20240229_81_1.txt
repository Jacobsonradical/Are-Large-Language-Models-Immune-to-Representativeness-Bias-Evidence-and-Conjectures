Here is my answer:

{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines with average word length ≥6 compared to the number of pages with average word length ≥6 that Investigator 1 recorded.

The reason is that there is likely more variability in average word length from line to line within a page, compared to the variability in average word length across full pages. While the overall book average is 4, each line can deviate quite a bit from that, with some lines having many short words and others having longer words. When you average out an entire page worth of lines, the higher and lower lines will tend to balance out more towards the overall mean.

So I expect more individual lines to cross the ≥6 threshold compared to full pages, since the full page averages get pulled more towards the mean. The line-by-line data has higher variance around the mean than the page-level aggregated data.
