Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length across full pages. Since each page contains many lines, the average word length per page will tend to converge towards the overall book average of 4. There will be relatively few pages that deviate significantly from this average to have an average word length of 6 or more.

In contrast, Investigator 2 looked at the average word length of just the first line on each page. A single line is a much smaller sample size than a full page. Due to the smaller sample, the average word length per line will have higher variance. More lines will happen to have long words and an average over 6, just by chance.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 will record a larger number of lines with average word length over 6 compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
