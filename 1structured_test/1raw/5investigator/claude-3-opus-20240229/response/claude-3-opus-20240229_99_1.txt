Here is my analysis:

The key insight is that by averaging over a larger sample (a full page of text vs a single line), the variability in average word length will be lower for Investigator 1 compared to Investigator 2.

While the overall book average is 4 letters per word, individual lines can easily deviate significantly from this average. It's not uncommon for a line to have several longer words, pushing its average over 6. However, when averaging over an entire page with many lines, the variability gets smoothed out. It would be much less common for a full page's average to exceed 6.

Therefore, I expect Investigator 2, who looked at individual lines, found many more instances of the average exceeding 6 compared to Investigator 1 who averaged over full pages.
