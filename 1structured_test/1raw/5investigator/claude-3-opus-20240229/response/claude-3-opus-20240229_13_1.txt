To determine which investigator likely recorded a larger number of units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of word-lengths within pages and lines.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page. Since a page contains many lines and words, the average word-length is less likely to deviate significantly from the overall book average of 4. Extreme values in word-length will be balanced out within a page.

Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. A line contains fewer words than a page, so the average word-length of a single line is more likely to deviate from the overall book average. There is a higher chance of finding lines with extreme average word-lengths.

Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1's number of units (pages).
