Here is my answer:

{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines with average word length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages with average word length of 6 or more recorded by Investigator 1.

The key insight is that there will be more variability in average word length at the line level compared to the page level. A page contains many lines, so the average word length of a full page will tend to be closer to the overall book average of 4. 

However, individual lines can more easily deviate from the average, with some lines containing longer words and others shorter words. So there will likely be a higher percentage of lines with average word length ≥6 than the percentage of pages with average ≥6.

In summary, the average word length will have a narrower distribution at the page level than the line level, leading Investigator 2 to find more lines meeting the ≥6 threshold compared to the pages found by Investigator 1. The line level data allows for more variability around the mean.
