To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of the average word-length in pages compared to lines.

Pages contain more words than lines, so the average word-length of a page is less likely to deviate significantly from the overall average of the book. In contrast, lines have fewer words, so their average word-length can vary more easily from the book's average.

Therefore, it is more likely that a single line will have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to an entire page, as the variability is higher for lines.
