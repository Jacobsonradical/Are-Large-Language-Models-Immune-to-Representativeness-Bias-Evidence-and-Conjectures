Let's think about this step-by-step:

1. The average word length for the entire book is 4. This means that on average, pages will also tend to have an average word length close to 4.

2. However, individual lines within a page can vary a lot more. A single line might have all very long or very short words, deviating significantly from the average.

3. Therefore, when looking at units (pages for Investigator 1, lines for Investigator 2) with an average word length of 6 or more, we would expect Investigator 2 to find more such units.

4. This is because there is more room for variation in a single line than in an entire page, which will tend to average out closer to the mean of the whole book.

So, my answer is:

{investigator: 2}
