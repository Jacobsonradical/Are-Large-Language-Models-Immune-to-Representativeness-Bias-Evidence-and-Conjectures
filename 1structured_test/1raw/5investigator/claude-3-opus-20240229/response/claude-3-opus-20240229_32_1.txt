To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length across the book.

Given:
- The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
- Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page.
- Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page.

Reasoning:
1. A page contains multiple lines, so the average word-length of a page is likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4.
2. A single line has fewer words compared to a full page, so the average word-length of a line is more likely to deviate from the overall book average.
3. Since the average word-length of the book is 4, it is more likely for a single line to have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to an entire page.

Therefore, Investigator 2, who computed the average word-length for the first line of each page, is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who computed the average word-length for each page.
