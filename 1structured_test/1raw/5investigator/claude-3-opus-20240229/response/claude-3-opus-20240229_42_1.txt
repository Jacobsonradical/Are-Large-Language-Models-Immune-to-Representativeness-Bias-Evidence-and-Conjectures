Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 computed the average word length over entire pages. Since each page contains many lines, the average word length per page will tend to be close to the overall book average of 4. There will be some variation page to page, but relatively few pages will deviate drastically from the mean.

Investigator 2 computed the average word length for just the first line on each page. Individual lines will show much higher variability than full pages. Due to this higher variance, more lines are likely to have an average word length of 6+ compared to full pages.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 probably recorded a larger number of lines with average word length 6+ than Investigator 1 recorded pages with average 6+.
