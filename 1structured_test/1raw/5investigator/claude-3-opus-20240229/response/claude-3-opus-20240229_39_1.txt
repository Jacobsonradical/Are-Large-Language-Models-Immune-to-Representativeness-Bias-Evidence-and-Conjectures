To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of average word-length in pages compared to lines.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for entire pages, while Investigator 2 only considered the first line of each page. A page contains more words than a single line, so the average word-length of a page is less likely to deviate significantly from the overall book average of 4.

In contrast, a single line has fewer words, so its average word-length is more prone to fluctuations. Some lines may have several long words, resulting in a higher average, while others may have mostly short words, leading to a lower average.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
