Here is my analysis:

The average word length across the entire book is 4. This means pages and lines will vary, with some above and some below that average.

Investigator 1 looked at the average across full pages. Since a page contains many lines, the average word length per page will tend to be closer to the overall book average of 4. There will be relatively few pages that deviate strongly enough to have an average of 6 or more.

Investigator 2 looked at only the first line on each page. A single line is a much smaller sample size than a full page. The average word length in a single line is more likely to vary substantially from the overall book average. More lines will happen to have averages of 6 or more just by chance.

Therefore, Investigator 2 most likely recorded a larger number of lines meeting the criteria compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
