Here is my analysis:

The average word length across the entire book is 4. However, the distribution of word lengths likely varies between pages and lines.

A full page of text contains many lines, so the average word length for a page is averaging over a larger sample size compared to a single line. With a larger sample, the average for a page is more likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4.

In contrast, a single line is a much smaller sample. With a smaller sample, there is more potential variability in the average word length from line to line. Some lines may have many short or long words by chance, causing the line average to deviate further from the overall book average.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2, who looked at the first line of each page, likely found a larger number of units (lines) with an average word length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages with average >= 6 found by Investigator 1.
