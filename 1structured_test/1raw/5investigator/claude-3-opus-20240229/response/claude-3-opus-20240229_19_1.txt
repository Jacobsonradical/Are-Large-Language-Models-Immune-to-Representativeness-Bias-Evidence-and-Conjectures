Based on the information provided, here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length over entire pages. Since pages contain many words (likely 200-400 words per page), the average word length will tend to be close to the overall book average of 4. It would be relatively rare for the average of a whole page to deviate substantially from the mean to reach 6+ words.

In contrast, Investigator 2 looked at the average word length of single lines. A line contains far fewer words than a page (perhaps 10-15 words). With a smaller sample size, there will be higher variability. It's more likely for the average of a short line to substantially deviate from the overall mean. There will likely be more lines that happen to contain a cluster of longer words pushing the line average to 6+.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 probably recorded a larger number of lines meeting the 6+ word average criteria compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
