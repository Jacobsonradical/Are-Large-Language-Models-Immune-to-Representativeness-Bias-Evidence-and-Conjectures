To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of word-lengths within pages and lines.

Given:
- The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
- Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page.
- Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page.

Reasoning:
1. Pages contain more words than lines, so the average word-length of a page is less likely to deviate significantly from the overall average of 4.
2. Lines, being smaller units, are more prone to variability in average word-length. A single line may contain several longer or shorter words, causing its average to deviate more from the overall average.
3. Since the overall average is 4, it is more likely for a line to have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to an entire page.

Therefore, Investigator 2, who counted the number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, likely recorded a larger number of such units compared to Investigator 1, who counted the number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
