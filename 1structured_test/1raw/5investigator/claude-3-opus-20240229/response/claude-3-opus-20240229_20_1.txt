To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length across pages and lines.

Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page. Since a page contains multiple lines, the variability in average word-length across pages is likely to be lower than the variability across individual lines. This is because the larger sample size (more words per page compared to a single line) tends to reduce the impact of extreme values and bring the average closer to the overall mean of 4.

Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page. Individual lines are more likely to have extreme average word-lengths (much higher or lower than the overall mean) due to the smaller sample size (fewer words per line).

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
