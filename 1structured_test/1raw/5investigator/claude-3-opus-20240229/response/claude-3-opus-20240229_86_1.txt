{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each full page, while Investigator 2 only considered the first line of each page.

Since the overall average word-length in the book is 4, it's more likely for a single line to deviate significantly from this average compared to a full page. A page contains many lines, so the average word-length of a page is less likely to be an extreme value due to the law of large numbers.

In other words, the variability of the average word-length is likely higher among single lines than among full pages. This means Investigator 2, who counted lines, probably found more instances of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of such pages found by Investigator 1.
