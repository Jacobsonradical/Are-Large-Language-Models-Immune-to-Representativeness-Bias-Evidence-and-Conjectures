Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. The average word length for the entire book is 4. This means that on average, each word in the book has 4 letters.

2. Investigator 1 is looking at the average word length per page. Since a page contains many lines and thus many words, the average word length per page is likely to be closer to the overall book average of 4.

3. Investigator 2 is looking at the average word length of just the first line on each page. A single line contains fewer words compared to a full page. With fewer words, there's more room for variability - the average word length of a single line could more easily deviate from the overall book average.

4. Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 2 will find more lines with an average word length of 6 or more, compared to the number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more found by Investigator 1.

So, my answer is:

{investigator: 2}
