Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 computed the average word length across entire pages. With an overall average of 4 words per page for the whole book, relatively few pages are likely to deviate far enough from this average to have 6 or more words per page on average. Most pages will cluster around that overall mean.

In contrast, Investigator 2 looked at only the first line of each page. There is likely to be much more variability in average word length from line to line compared to page to page averages. With more variability, a higher proportion of lines are likely to hit that 6 word average threshold compared to the proportion of pages.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 probably recorded a larger number of lines meeting the 6 word average criteria compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
