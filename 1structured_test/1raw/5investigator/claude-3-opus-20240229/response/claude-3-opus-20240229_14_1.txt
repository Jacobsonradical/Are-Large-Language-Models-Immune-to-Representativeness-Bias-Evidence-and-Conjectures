Here is my analysis:

Investigator 1 looked at the average word length over entire pages. With an overall average of 4 words per page in the book, it would be relatively rare to find pages where the average word length is 6 or more, since that's significantly higher than the overall average.

In contrast, Investigator 2 looked at just the first line of each page. There will naturally be more variability in average word length from line to line compared to page averages. Even with an overall average of 4, there are likely to be a fair number of individual lines that have an average word length of 6 or more, just by random chance.

Therefore, I believe Investigator 2 probably recorded a larger number of lines meeting that criteria compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
