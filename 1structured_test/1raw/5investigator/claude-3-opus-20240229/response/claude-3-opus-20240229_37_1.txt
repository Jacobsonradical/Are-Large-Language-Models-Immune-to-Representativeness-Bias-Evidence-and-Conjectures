To determine which investigator likely recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length within pages and lines.

Given:
- The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
- Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for each page.
- Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line of each page.

Reasoning:
1. A page contains multiple lines, so the average word-length of a page is less likely to deviate significantly from the overall average of 4 compared to a single line.
2. A single line is more likely to have an average word-length that differs from the overall average due to the smaller sample size.
3. Consequently, Investigator 2, who considered only the first line of each page, is more likely to encounter lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who considered the average of entire pages.
