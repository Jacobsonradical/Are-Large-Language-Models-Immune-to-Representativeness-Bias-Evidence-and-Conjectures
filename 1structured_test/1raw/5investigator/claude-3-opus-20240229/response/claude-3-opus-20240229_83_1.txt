To determine which investigator likely recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability in word-length within pages and across the entire book.

Since the average word-length for the entire book is 4, it is likely that most pages will have an average close to 4. However, there may be some pages with a significantly higher or lower average, but these would be less common.

On the other hand, when considering individual lines, there is more room for variability. A single line could easily have an average word-length of 6 or more, even if the page average is close to 4.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2, who counted lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, would record a larger number of such units compared to Investigator 1, who counted pages with the same criteria.
