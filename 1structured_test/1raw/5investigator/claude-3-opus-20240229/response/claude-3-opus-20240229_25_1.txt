To determine which investigator likely recorded more units (pages or lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, we need to consider the variability of the average word-length within each unit.

Investigator 1 looked at the average word-length of entire pages. Since a page contains many lines, the variability of the average word-length across pages is likely to be lower due to the law of large numbers. Extreme values (very high or very low average word-lengths) are less likely to occur when considering larger units like pages.

On the other hand, Investigator 2 looked at the average word-length of individual lines. The variability of the average word-length across lines is likely to be higher because each line contains fewer words. This means that extreme values (like lines with an average word-length of 6 or more) are more likely to occur when considering smaller units like lines.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages recorded by Investigator 1.
