{investigator: 2} 

The rationale behind this choice is that individual lines of text are more likely to display greater variance in word length than entire pages. A single line may coincidentally combine several long words due to specific topics or sentence structures that skew its average upwards. In contrast, an entire page of text is more likely to average out to a closer approximation of the book's overall average word length due to the larger sample size of words being considered. Hence, Investigator 2, who analyzed the first line on each page, is more likely to observe extreme values (i.e., average word-lengths of 6 or more) compared to Investigator 1, who averaged the lengths across many lines on a page.
