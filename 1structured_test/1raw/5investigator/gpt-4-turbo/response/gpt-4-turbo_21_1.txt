{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2, who examines the first line of each page, is likely to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the variability of word length in a single line can be greater than across an entire page. Pages average out their word lengths over many lines and words, which could dilute the appearance of extremes (like those lines exclusively with longer words) that might occur in individual lines. First lines on pages might not represent the whole page's average and can vary more dramatically from the overall average word length of the book, thereby capturing more instances of higher word-length averages.
