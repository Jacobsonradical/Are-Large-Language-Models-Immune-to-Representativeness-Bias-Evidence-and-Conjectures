{investigator: 2}

Explanation: Investigator 2, who examined only the first line of each page, is more likely to have recorded a greater count of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who looked at the average of whole pages. Given that individual lines can vary significantly and might more easily skew towards having unusually long words than entire pages (considering pages average out their word-lengths across numerous lines), it's probable that Investigator 2 encountered more instances of higher average word-lengths. Additionally, the variation in word length might be less averaged out in a single line as opposed to whole pages, leading to more frequent spikes above the average.
