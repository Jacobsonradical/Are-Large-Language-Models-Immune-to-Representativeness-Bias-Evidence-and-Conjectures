To answer this question, we must consider the aggregation level at which each investigator is working. Investigator 1 calculates the average word length at a page level, while Investigator 2 calculates it at the first-line level of each page.

1. **Variability**: The average taken over an entire page (Investigator 1) is likely to be less variable and closer to the overall average of the book (4 words) due to the larger sample size (many lines and words). In contrast, taking an average from just the first line of each page (Investigator 2) is more susceptible to higher variability because it depends on fewer words; thus, it can swing more dramatically away from the overall average.

2. **Occurrences of High Averages**: Given that lines are shorter and more variable, it's more probable that individually, some lines can significantly deviate from the mean compared to entire pages. Therefore, thereâ€™s a higher likelihood the first line on some pages might average a word-length of 6 or more compared to the average word-length of an entire page.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the above reasoning about variability and sample sizes, Investigator 2, who examines only the first line of each page, is more likely to encounter lines with an average word length of 6 or more.

Thus, the answer would be:
{investigator: 2}
