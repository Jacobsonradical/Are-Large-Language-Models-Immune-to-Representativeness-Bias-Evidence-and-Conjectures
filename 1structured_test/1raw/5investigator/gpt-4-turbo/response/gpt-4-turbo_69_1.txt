{investigator: 2}

Hereâ€™s the reasoning: Investigator 2 is examining only the first line on each page versus Investigator 1, who averages the word lengths across the entire contents of a page. Given that each line can vary substantially in terms of word usage and complexity, it is likely that the variability in word length within just the first lines of each page might have a higher chance of exceeding an average word-length of 6 compared to the average word length across the entire page, which would be more likely to balance to near the overall book average of 4 due to inclusion of a larger sample of text. Hence, Investigator 2 might record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 would with full pages.
