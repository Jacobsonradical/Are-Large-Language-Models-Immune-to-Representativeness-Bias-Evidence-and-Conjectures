{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
The average word-length in the entire book is 4. This means that there will be more lines and pages with an average word-length below 6 than above 6.

Investigator 1 counted the number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more, while Investigator 2 counted the number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Since there are more lines than pages in a book, it is more likely that Investigator 2 (who counted lines) recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. The number of such lines is likely to be greater than the number of such pages.

Therefore, I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1.
