{investigator: 3}

Explanation:
Since the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it is reasonable to assume that the distribution of word-lengths
across the book is similar, with some pages/lines having a higher average and some lower. 

Considering that the entire book has an average of 4, the number of pages/lines with an average word-length of 6 or more
is likely to be similar, as they are both measuring the same underlying property of the text. Unless there is a significant
bias in the distribution of word-lengths across the pages, the two investigators are likely to record a similar number of
pages/lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the two investigators will record about the same number of such units (within 5%
of each other).
