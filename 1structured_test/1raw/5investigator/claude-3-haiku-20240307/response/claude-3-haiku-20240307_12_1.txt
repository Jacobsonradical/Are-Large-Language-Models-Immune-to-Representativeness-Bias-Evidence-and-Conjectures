Explanation:
Since the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it is likely that the majority of the pages and lines have an average word-length around 4. Some pages and lines may have a higher average word-length, but it is reasonable to assume that the number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more and the number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more are within 5% of each other.
