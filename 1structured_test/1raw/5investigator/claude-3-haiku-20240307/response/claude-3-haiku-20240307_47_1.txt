{investigator: 1}

Explanation:
The average word-length in the entire book is 4. This means that some pages/lines will have a higher average word-length, and some will have a lower average word-length.

Investigator 1 counted the number of pages that had an average word-length of 6 or more. Since the book has a lower overall average word-length, it is more likely that individual pages will have a higher average word-length than individual lines.

Therefore, investigator 1 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to investigator 2.
