{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Since the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it is likely that more lines than pages will have an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because individual lines may have a higher variation in word length compared to the average over an entire page.

Therefore, Investigator 2, who counted the number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units compared to Investigator 1, who counted the number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
