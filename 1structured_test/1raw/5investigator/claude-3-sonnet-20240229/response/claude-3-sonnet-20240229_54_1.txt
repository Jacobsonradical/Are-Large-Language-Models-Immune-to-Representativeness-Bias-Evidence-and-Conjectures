{investigator: 2}

The first line of a page tends to have longer words on average compared to the entire page. This is because the first line often contains the title or topic sentence, which typically has longer and more descriptive words. The subsequent lines in the page may have a mix of shorter and longer words, bringing down the overall average word-length for the page.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2, who considered the first lines of pages, would have encountered a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who considered entire pages.
