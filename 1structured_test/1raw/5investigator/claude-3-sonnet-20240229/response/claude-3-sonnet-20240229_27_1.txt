{investigator: 2}

The average word-length is 4 for the entire book, which means that some pages and lines will have a higher average word-length, and some will have a lower average word-length. However, it's generally more likely for a single line to have a higher average word-length than an entire page.

A page consists of multiple lines, and the longer words in one line can be balanced out by shorter words in other lines, resulting in a more moderate average word-length for the entire page. However, for a single line, there is no such averaging effect, and a few longer words can significantly increase the average word-length for that line.

Therefore, it's more probable that Investigator 2, who counted the number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, recorded a larger number of such units compared to Investigator 1, who counted the number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
