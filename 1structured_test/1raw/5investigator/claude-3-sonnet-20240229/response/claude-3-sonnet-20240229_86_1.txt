{investigator: 2}

The average word-length of a line is likely to have a larger variation than the average word-length of a page. This is because a page contains many lines, and the variations in word lengths across lines tend to average out over the entire page.

On the other hand, a single line does not have this averaging effect, and a few long words can skew the average word-length of that line upwards more significantly.

Therefore, it is more probable that Investigator 2, who was counting lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, recorded a larger number of such units compared to Investigator 1, who was counting pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
