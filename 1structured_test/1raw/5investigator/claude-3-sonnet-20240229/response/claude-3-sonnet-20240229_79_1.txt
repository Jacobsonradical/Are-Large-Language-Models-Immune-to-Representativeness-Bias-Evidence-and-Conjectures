{investigator: 2}

The key reason for choosing option 2 (Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more) is that lines of text tend to have a higher variability in average word-length compared to entire pages.

When considering a single page, the average word-length is calculated over a larger sample of words, which tends to bring the average closer to the overall mean (4 in this case). Outlier lines with very long or very short words are averaged out by the rest of the page.

However, when considering individual lines, the average word-length can fluctuate more widely from the overall mean. A line with a few long words can easily have an average word-length of 6 or more, even if the page or book average is lower.

Therefore, it is more likely for Investigator 2, who examined individual lines, to have encountered a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 1, who examined entire pages.
