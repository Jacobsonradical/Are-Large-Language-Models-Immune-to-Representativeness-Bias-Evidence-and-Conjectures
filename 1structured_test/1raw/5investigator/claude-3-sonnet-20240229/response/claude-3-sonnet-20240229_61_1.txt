{investigator: 2}

The lines in a page are likely to have more variation in their average word-length compared to the entire page. This is because the lines are shorter units, and the presence of a few long words can skew the average significantly. In contrast, the pages contain many more words, and the effect of a few long words on the average word-length is diluted.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2, who considered the average word-length of individual lines, observed a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 1, who considered the average word-length of entire pages.
