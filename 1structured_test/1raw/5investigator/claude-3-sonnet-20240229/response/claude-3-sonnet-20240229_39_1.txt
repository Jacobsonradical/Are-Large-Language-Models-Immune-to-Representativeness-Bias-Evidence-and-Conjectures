Since the average word-length across the entire book is 4, it is reasonable to expect that most pages and most lines will have an average word-length close to 4. However, some pages and lines will inevitably have higher or lower averages due to natural variation in language.

In general, the larger the sample size (number of words), the closer the average word-length is likely to be to the overall average of 4. This is because outliers (very short or very long words) tend to cancel out in larger samples.

Since the investigator 1 is taking the average over an entire page, which typically contains many lines and many words, the sample size for each page is larger than the sample size for a single line used by investigator 2.

Therefore, it is more likely that the average word-length for a page will be closer to the overall average of 4, compared to the average word-length of a single line, which has a smaller sample size and is more susceptible to outliers.

As a result, investigator 2 (who is looking at single lines) is more likely to find a higher number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to investigator 1 (who is looking at entire pages).

However, since the question asks if the two numbers are within 5% of each other, and we don't have specific information about the distribution of word lengths in the book, it is reasonable to assume that the two numbers are likely to be relatively close, within a 5% margin.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "3," indicating that the two investigators likely recorded a similar number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, within a 5% margin of each other.
