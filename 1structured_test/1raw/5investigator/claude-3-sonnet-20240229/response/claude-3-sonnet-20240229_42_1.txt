The average word-length over an entire page is likely to be closer to the overall average of 4 than the average word-length over a single line. This is because longer and shorter lines tend to balance each other out over a full page.

Therefore, it is more likely that the number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more and the number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more are within 5% of each other, rather than one being significantly larger than the other.
