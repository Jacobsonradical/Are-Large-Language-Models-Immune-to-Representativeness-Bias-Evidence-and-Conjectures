Since the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it is more likely that a single line will have an average word-length of 6 or more than an entire page having an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the variation in average word-length is likely to be higher over a single line compared to an entire page, where the longer and shorter words tend to average out.

However, the difference may not be significant, as the book's overall average word-length is not too far from 6. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the number of pages and lines with an average word-length of 6 or more would be within 5% of each other.
