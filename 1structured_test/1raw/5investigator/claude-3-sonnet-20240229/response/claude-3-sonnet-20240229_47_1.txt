To solve this problem, let's consider the following:

For Investigator 1:
- They are computing the average word-length for entire pages of the book.
- Pages typically contain multiple lines of text.
- The average word-length for a page is influenced by all the lines in that page.
- If a page has a high average word-length (6 or more), it means that most of the lines in that page must have a relatively high average word-length.

For Investigator 2:
- They are computing the average word-length for single lines in each page.
- A single line may have a high average word-length, but the rest of the lines in the same page may not.

Based on this analysis, it's likely that Investigator 1 recorded a larger number of units (pages) with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 2 (lines). This is because a page with a high average word-length implies that most of its lines also have a relatively high average word-length.

Therefore, the answer is:

{investigator: 1}
