{investigator: 1}

The key points are:

1. Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for entire pages, while Investigator 2 computed it for single lines.
2. They both counted the number of units (pages or lines) that had an average word-length of 6 or more.
3. The average word-length of the entire book is 4, which is less than 6.

Given that the pages contain multiple lines, it is more likely for an entire page to have an average word-length deviating from the book's average (4) and reaching 6 or more, as compared to a single line. This is because the averaging is done over a larger sample size (all words in a page) for Investigator 1, allowing for more extreme values to be balanced out.

On the other hand, for Investigator 2, the average word-length is computed over a much smaller sample size (words in a single line), making it less likely for the average to deviate significantly from the book's average of 4.

Therefore, it is more probable that Investigator 1 recorded a larger number of units (pages) with an average word-length of 6 or more, as compared to Investigator 2 (lines).
