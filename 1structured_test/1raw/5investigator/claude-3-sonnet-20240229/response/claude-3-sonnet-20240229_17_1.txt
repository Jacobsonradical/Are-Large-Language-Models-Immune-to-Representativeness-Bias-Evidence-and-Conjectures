{investigator: 2}

The lines of text are likely to have more variability in average word length compared to entire pages. On a page, the distribution of short and long words tends to average out, making it less likely for the page's average word length to deviate significantly from the overall average of 4.

However, individual lines can have a higher concentration of either short or long words, leading to more extreme values for the average word length of that line. This makes it more probable for lines to have an average word length of 6 or higher compared to entire pages.

Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2, who counted the number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more, recorded a larger number of such units compared to Investigator 1, who counted the number of pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
