{investigator: 2}

The reasoning is that lines, in general, are shorter than pages. The shorter the text unit, the more likely it is to show greater variance in average word length. Since Investigator 2 is focusing on individual lines, which are shorter units than entire pages that Investigator 1 is considering, the lines are more likely to exhibit greater extremes in average word length. This means that more lines will likely have an average word length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages with such an average. Therefore, Investigator 2 is likely to record a higher number of units that meet the 6 or more average word-length criterion.
