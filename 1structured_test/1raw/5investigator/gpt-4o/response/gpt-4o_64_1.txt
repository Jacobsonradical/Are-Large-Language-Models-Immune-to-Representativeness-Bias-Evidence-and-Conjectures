{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. Here’s the reasoning:

1. **Distribution Variability**: The average word-length on an entire page is likely to be more stable and closer to the book’s overall average of 4 compared to the average word-length in just the first lines of each page. This is due to the law of large numbers – the more words considered, the more representative the sample is of the population (the book’s overall average).

2. **Focus on Smaller Units**: Since Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, the average word-length can swing more drastically above or below the book's overall average. This is because there are fewer words in a line compared to a whole page, allowing for greater variability and thus higher chances of encountering lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Therefore, Investigator 2 is expected to encounter more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of such pages recorded by Investigator 1.
