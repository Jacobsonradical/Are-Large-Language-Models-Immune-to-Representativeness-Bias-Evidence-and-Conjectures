{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded more lines with an average word length of 6 or more. This is because individual lines are shorter units compared to full pages, and hence, their average word length can vary more significantly. Pages are composed of multiple lines averaging out word lengths, which tends towards the overall average of 4 more consistently. Therefore, the variability in line averages is likely higher, resulting in more instances where lines have an average word length of 6 or more, compared to entire pages.
