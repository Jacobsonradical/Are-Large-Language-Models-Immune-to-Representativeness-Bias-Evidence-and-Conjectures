{investigator: 2}

The reason is that lines tend to have less variability in average word-length compared to entire pages. Since Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, there's a higher chance of encountering a line with an average word-length of 6 or more. Meanwhile, Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages, which have more words and therefore a more stabilized average, making it less likely for pages to have an average word-length of 6 or more.
