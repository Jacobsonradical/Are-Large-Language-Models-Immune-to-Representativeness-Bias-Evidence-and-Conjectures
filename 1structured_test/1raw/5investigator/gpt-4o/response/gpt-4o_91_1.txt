{investigator: 2}

Here's the reasoning: Investigators are computing average word lengths on different scales, with Investigator 1 looking at pages and Investigator 2 looking at lines. Since each line is a smaller sample than a whole page, it's more likely to observe extreme values (such as average word lengths of 6 or more) on a per-line basis due to less smoothing of variations. Therefore, Investigator 2 is expected to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of whole pages meeting the same criterion.
