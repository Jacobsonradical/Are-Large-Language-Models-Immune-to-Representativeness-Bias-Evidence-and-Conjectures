{investigator: 1}

Explanation: Investigator 1 is likely to have recorded more pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. While individual lines might have more variability and could occasionally have higher average word-lengths, pages tend to have more words and therefore provide a more consistent measure that's less prone to fluctuations. Since pages contain more words, it increases the chance of having some pages with a higher average word-length compared to just the first line of each page. Thus, pages that meet or exceed the average word-length of 6 are likely to be more frequent than lines meeting the same criterion.
