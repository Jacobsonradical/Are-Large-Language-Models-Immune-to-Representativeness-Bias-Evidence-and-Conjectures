{investigator: 2}

**Reasoning:** Pages typically contain many lines, and each line contains multiple words. So, the variability in the average word-length is more diluted when averaged over an entire page compared to a single line. Therefore, reaching an average word-length of 6 or more is less likely for a whole page compared to an individual line. Consequently, investigator 2, who is analyzing the average word-length of individual lines, is more likely to count a larger number of lines that have an average word-length of 6 or more.
