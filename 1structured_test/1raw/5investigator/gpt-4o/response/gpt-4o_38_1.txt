The reasoning is that lines are generally shorter than pages, hence the variability in average word-length is likely to be higher in individual lines compared to entire pages. This higher variability increases the chance that more individual lines will have sporadic higher average word-lengths, while the average word-length of entire pages (which averages over more words) is likely to be closer to the book's overall average of 4. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
