{investigator: 2}

The reasoning is that Investigator 2 is focusing on individual lines, while Investigator 1 is focusing on entire pages. Generally, averages calculated over smaller units (lines in this case) are more likely to show greater variation than averages calculated over larger units (pages). Therefore, it is likely that more lines will have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to pages.
