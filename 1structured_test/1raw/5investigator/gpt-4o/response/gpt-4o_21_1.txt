{investigator: 2}

Here's the reasoning: 

The average word-length of the entire book is 4, which suggests that the distribution of word lengths across pages and lines is centered around this value. However, given that pages contain many lines and hence many words, the variance in the average word-length per page will generally be smaller compared to the variance per line. This is because averaging over more words (like a full page) will tend to smooth out extremes (due to the Law of Large Numbers), while a single line (which contains fewer words) could more easily exhibit extreme averages (high variance).

Since Investigator 2 is focusing on single lines, they are more likely to encounter instances where a line has an unusually high average word-length, compared to Investigator 1 who is averaging over entire pages. Therefore, it is more probable that Investigator 2 would encounter a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 would encounter pages with that same characteristic.

Thus, Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more.
