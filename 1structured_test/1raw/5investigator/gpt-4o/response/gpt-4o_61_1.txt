{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more because the lines are shorter compared to entire pages. Short lines will have more variance in average word lengths. Thus, it is more probable to find lines with extreme averages than entire pages, which might have their word lengths average out more due to larger sample size.
