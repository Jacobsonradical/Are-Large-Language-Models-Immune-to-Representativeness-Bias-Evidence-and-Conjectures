{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2, who computed the average word-length of the first line on each page, is likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because a single line is more prone to greater variability and extremities in word length compared to an entire page, which is an aggregation of multiple lines and hence tends to average out. Consequently, it is more probable to find individual lines where the average word-length exceeds 6, compared to entire pages.
