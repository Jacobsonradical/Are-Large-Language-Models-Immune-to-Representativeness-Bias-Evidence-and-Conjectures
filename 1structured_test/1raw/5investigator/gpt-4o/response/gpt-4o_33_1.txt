The reasoning is based on the concept of variance and aggregation. In general, the average word-length in the first line of a page (considering single lines) is likely to show greater variability than the average word-length over an entire page (with more words taken into account, resulting in a potentially balancing effect of word lengths). This means that lines are more likely to exhibit extreme averages compared to entire pages. Therefore, Investigator 2, who analyzes single lines, is likely to record a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
