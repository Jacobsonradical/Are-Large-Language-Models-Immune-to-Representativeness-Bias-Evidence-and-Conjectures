{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages with such an average word-length recorded by Investigator 1. This is because lines are shorter units than pages, leading to more variability in average word-length. Therefore, it is more probable that some individual lines will have high average word-lengths compared to entire pages.
