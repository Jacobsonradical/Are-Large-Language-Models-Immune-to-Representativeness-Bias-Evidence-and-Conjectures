{investigator: 2}

Here's the reasoning: Investigator 2 is looking at average word-lengths per line, while Investigator 1 is looking at average word-lengths per page. Since a page usually contains multiple lines, there will be more variability in the averages of individual lines compared to entire pages. This higher variability means that it's more likely for some lines to have an average word length of 6 or more, even if the overall average over all lines or pages is 4. Therefore, Investigator 2 is likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 with pages.
