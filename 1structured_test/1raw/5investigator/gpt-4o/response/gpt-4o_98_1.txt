{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This can be reasoned as follows:

- A page typically contains multiple lines, meaning the average word-length across an entire page aggregates the word-lengths of all its lines. Extreme values (very short or very long words) tend to get averaged out when considering the entire page, reducing the variability.
- In contrast, examining only the first line of each page introduces less averaging since itâ€™s a smaller dataset (only one line). Hence, there are more opportunities for the average word-length of an individual line to exceed the threshold of 6.
  
Given that individual lines are more susceptible to extreme averages compared to entire pages, Investigator 2 is expected to record a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
