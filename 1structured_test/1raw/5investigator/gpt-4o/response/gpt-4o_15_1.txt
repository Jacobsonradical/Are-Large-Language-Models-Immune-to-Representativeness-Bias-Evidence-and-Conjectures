{investigator: 1}

Explanation: Investigator 1 is analyzing the entire page, which usually contains a large number of words. This means there is more variability in the average word-length per page. Given that the overall average word-length in the book is 4, it is less likely that the average word-length for entire pages frequently hits the higher threshold of 6 or more, unless a significant portion of the page consists of longer words.

Investigator 2 is only considering the first line of each page, which typically contains fewer words. Since there are fewer words, the average word-length in the first line has more potential for variability. Therefore, it is more likely for a single line to occasionally have an average word-length of 6 or more, as even a few long words could significantly impact the average.

Thus, Investigator 2 is more likely to record a greater number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 recording pages with that criteria.
