{investigator: 2}

This conclusion is based on the idea that computing averages from smaller samples (like a single line) tends to produce a greater variance compared to larger samples (like entire pages). Therefore, individual lines are more likely to have average word lengths that are significantly higher (or lower) than the overall book's average word length compared to entire pages. As a result, Investigator 2 is more likely to encounter lines with average word lengths of 6 or more.
