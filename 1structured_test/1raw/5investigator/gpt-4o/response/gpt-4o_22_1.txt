{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 likely recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because individual lines are generally more variable in their average word-length compared to entire pages, which aggregate the word-lengths of many lines and generally exhibit less variation.

For example, a single line can easily have a high average word-length simply due to a few longer words, whereas an entire page with many lines tends to average out such variations. Thus, it's more probable for Investigator 2 to find more lines with high average word-lengths than Investigator 1 finding entire pages meeting the same criterion.
