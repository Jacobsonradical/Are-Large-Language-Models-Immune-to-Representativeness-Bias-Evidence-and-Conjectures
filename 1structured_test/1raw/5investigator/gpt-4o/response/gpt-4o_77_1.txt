{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 with pages. This is because the variability in word lengths is more pronounced on a line-by-line basis than on a page-by-page basis. A single line can have very few words and still achieve a high average word-length more easily than an entire page, which aggregates many lines and words, smoothing out extremes. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to identify lines meeting the criteria of an average word-length of 6 or more.
