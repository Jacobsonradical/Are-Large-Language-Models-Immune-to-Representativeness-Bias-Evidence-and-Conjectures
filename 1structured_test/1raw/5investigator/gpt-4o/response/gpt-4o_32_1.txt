{investigator: 2}

Reasoning:
- A line is a shorter unit compared to an entire page, which consists of multiple lines. Given this, variability in word length is more likely to cause a higher average word length in a single line rather than across an entire page where the average effect will moderate extreme values.
- Therefore, Investigator 2, who calculates averages on the first line of each page, is more likely to encounter lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1, who calculates averages based on the entire page.
