{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because a single line, especially the first line of a page, may contain longer words or sentences that are meant to grab the reader's attention. In contrast, Investigator 1's counting is based on the entire page, which would include shorter words and sentences that balance out the longer ones, resulting in a lower average word-length. Therefore, it is less likely that Investigator 1 would have counted as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
