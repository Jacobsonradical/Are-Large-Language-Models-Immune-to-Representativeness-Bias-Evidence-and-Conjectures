{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page often contains longer words, such as the title of a chapter or section, or a topic sentence that introduces the content of the page. Additionally, lines are shorter than pages, so a single long word can have a greater impact on the average word-length of a line than it would on the average word-length of a page.

However, without more information about the specific book and the distribution of word lengths, it is impossible to say for certain which investigator recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more. It is possible that they are within 5% of each other, but this is less likely given the reasons mentioned above.
