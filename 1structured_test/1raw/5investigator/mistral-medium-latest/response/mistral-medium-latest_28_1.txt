{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to be a title or a heading, and therefore may contain longer words. Investigator 1, on the other hand, is looking at the average word-length for the entire page, which would likely include more varied text and thus have a lower average word-length. Therefore, it is less likely that Investigator 1 would find as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more as Investigator 2 would find lines.
