{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to be a title or a heading and therefore more likely to contain shorter words than the rest of the page. This means that the average word-length of the first line is likely to be lower than the average word-length of the entire page. As a result, there will be fewer lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such pages than Investigator 2 has recorded lines.
