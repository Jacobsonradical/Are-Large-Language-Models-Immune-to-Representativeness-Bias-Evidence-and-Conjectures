{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because when considering only the first line of each page, it is more likely to find an instance of a longer line, compared to the average word-length across the entire page. This is due to the fact that pages tend to have a mix of shorter and longer lines, but the first line may be longer due to the absence of indentation or the start of a new paragraph with a longer introductory sentence. As a result, Investigator 2 would have a higher chance of observing lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
