{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because when investigating the first line of each page, there is a higher chance of encountering longer words that might be used at the beginning of a chapter or section for emphasis or to introduce new concepts. In contrast, investigator 1's analysis takes into account the entire page, which would include more varied word lengths and be less likely to have as many instances of an average word-length of 6 or more.
