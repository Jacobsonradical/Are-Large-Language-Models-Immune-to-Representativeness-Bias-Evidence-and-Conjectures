{investigator: 2}

Explanation:

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of writing, such as starting with shorter pronouns or articles. As a result, the average word-length of the first line is likely to be lower than the average word-length of the entire page, making it less likely for the first line to have an average word-length of 6 or more. Therefore, Investigator 2 will have to look at more lines in order to find a sufficient number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 1 who is looking at entire pages.
