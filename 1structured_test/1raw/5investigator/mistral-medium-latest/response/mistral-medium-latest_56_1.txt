{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Here's the reasoning:

1. The average word-length in the entire book is 4.
2. Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for every page, which includes multiple lines.
3. Investigator 2 computed the average word-length for the first line in each page.
4. Since the overall average word-length is 4, it's more likely that single lines will have a higher variance in word-length than whole pages, which are an aggregate of multiple lines.
5. Therefore, it's more probable that Investigator 2 will find a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, as they are looking at individual lines, which may have more extreme values compared to the averages of entire pages.
