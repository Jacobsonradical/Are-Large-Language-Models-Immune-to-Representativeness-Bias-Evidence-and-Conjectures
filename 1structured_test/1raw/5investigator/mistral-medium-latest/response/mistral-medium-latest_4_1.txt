{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which tends to have longer words to grab the reader's attention and set the tone for the rest of the page. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length for the entire page, which would be lowered by the presence of shorter words in the rest of the text. Therefore, it is less likely that the average word-length for an entire page would be 6 or more.
