{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, because they are looking at individual lines rather than entire pages. Since the average word-length in the book is 4, it is less likely for a full page to have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to a single line, which might contain only a few words. Therefore, Investigator 2 has a higher chance of finding lines with longer average word-lengths.
