{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which may not be representative of the entire page's average word-length. It is possible that the first line of a page has a higher average word-length than the rest of the page, leading to an overestimation of the number of lines with a high average word-length. On the other hand, Investigator 1's count is based on the entire page, which should be a more accurate reflection of the page's average word-length. Therefore, it is likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
