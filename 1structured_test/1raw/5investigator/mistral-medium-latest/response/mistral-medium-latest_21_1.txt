{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of sentence construction and the need for a hook or clear topic sentence at the beginning of a page or chapter. This means that there will be fewer words on that line on average, making it easier for a few longer words to push the average word-length over 6. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which is likely to have a more even distribution of word lengths and thus be less likely to have an average word-length of 6 or more.
