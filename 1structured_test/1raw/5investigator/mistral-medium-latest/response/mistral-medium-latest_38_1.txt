{investigator: 2}

The investigator who looked at the first lines of each page (Investigator 2) is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first lines of books often contain longer words, such as the title of the chapter or a topic sentence, which can skew the average word-length upwards. In contrast, Investigator 1 looked at the average word-length for each page as a whole, which would likely be more representative of the overall average word-length of 4. Therefore, they would be less likely to find as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
