{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at individual lines, which tend to be shorter than entire pages. Therefore, it is more likely for a line to have an average word-length of 6 or more than it is for an entire page. Additionally, since the overall average word-length in the book is 4, it is less likely for an entire page to have an average word-length of 6 or more.
