{investigator: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that a single line likely contains fewer words than an entire page. Therefore, it would be easier for the average word-length in a line to be 6 or more, since there are fewer words contributing to the average. This means that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more) compared to Investigator 1.
