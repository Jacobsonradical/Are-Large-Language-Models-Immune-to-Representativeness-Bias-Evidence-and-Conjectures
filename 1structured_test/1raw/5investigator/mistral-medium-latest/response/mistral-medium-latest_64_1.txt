{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have a smaller number of words compared to an entire page. Therefore, it is more likely for the average word-length of a single line to be higher than the average word-length of an entire page, which includes more words and may have a lower average word-length due to the inclusion of shorter words.
