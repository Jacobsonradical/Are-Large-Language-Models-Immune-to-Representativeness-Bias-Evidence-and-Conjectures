{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the sample size for Investigator 2 is smaller (one line per page instead of the entire page) which makes it more likely to find instances with higher average word-lengths. Additionally, the first line of a page may be more likely to contain longer words, such as the title of a chapter or a section heading, which could further increase the chances of finding lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such lines compared to Investigator 1 who looked at the entire page.
