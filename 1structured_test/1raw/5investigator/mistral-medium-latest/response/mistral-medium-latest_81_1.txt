{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only considering the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of writing, such as starting a sentence with a short pronoun or article. As a result, the average word-length of the first line is likely to be lower than the average word-length of the entire page. Therefore, it would be easier for Investigator 2 to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, since the threshold is higher relative to the average word-length of the first line. In contrast, Investigator 1 is considering the entire page, which includes shorter and longer words, making it less likely to find pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
