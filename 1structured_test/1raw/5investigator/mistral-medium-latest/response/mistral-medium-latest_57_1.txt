{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at only the first line of each page, which may contain more lengthy words used for introducing or summarizing the content of the page. Investigator 1, on the other hand, is looking at the average word-length of the entire page, which may be brought down by shorter words in the rest of the text.

However, this is just an educated guess based on the information provided, and it's possible that the actual results could be different. Without knowing more about the distribution of word lengths in the book and the specific pages and lines that were analyzed, it's difficult to say for certain which investigator recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
