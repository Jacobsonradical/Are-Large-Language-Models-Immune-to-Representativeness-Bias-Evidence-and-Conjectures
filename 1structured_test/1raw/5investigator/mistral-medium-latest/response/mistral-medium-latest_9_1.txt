{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because lines typically have fewer words than a whole page, so the average word-length is more likely to be influenced by longer words. In contrast, a page contains many more words, which would tend to bring the average word-length closer to the overall average of 4. Thus, it would be less likely for a page to have an average word-length of 6 or more.
