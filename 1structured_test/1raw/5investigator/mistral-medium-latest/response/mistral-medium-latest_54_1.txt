{investigator: 2}

Here's my reasoning:

1. The average word length in the entire book is 4, meaning most words are around this length.
2. Investigator 1 computed the average word length for each page, while Investigator 2 computed the average word length for the first line of each page.
3. Since the average word length is 4, it's likely that most pages and lines have an average word length close to 4.
4. Investigator 2 is looking at only the first line of each page, which may not be representative of the entire page's average word length.
5. It's more likely that Investigator 2 will find a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more, since they are only looking at the first line of each page. This is because there's a greater chance of finding an outlier or an unusually long word in a smaller sample size.
6. Therefore, I think Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units.
