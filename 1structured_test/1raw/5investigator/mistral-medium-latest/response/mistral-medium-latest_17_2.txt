{investigator: 2}

Explanation:

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 only looked at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words than the rest of the page due to the conventions of writing, such as using shorter words for hooks or summaries at the beginning of a page. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 will see more instances of lines with longer average word-lengths compared to Investigator 1, who looked at the entire page.

Additionally, Investigator 2 has more opportunities to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more because they are looking at the first line of each page, rather than the entire page as a whole. This means that Investigator 2 is looking at more units of analysis, which increases their chances of finding lines with longer average word-lengths.

Overall, while there may be some variation in the number of units recorded by each investigator, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
