{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is more likely to have longer words due to the presence of proper nouns, titles, or topic introductions. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which includes a mix of short and long words, and is therefore less likely to have as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
