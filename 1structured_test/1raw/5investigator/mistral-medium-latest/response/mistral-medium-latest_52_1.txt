{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 1's analysis is based on entire pages, which would include more words and thus have a higher chance of balancing out any particularly long or short words, resulting in a lower overall average word-length per page. In contrast, Investigator 2's analysis is based on individual lines, which may be more likely to contain particularly long words without being balanced out by shorter words in the same unit of analysis. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
