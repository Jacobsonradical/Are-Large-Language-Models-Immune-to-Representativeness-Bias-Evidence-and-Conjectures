{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 1. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of sentence structure and paragraph beginnings. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length of the entire page, which includes longer and more complex sentences, making it less likely that the average word-length will be 6 or more. Therefore, Investigator 2 is likely to have more instances of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 has pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
