{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, as they are only looking at the first line of each page. This line is likely to be a title or a heading, which tends to have shorter words and fewer words overall compared to a typical line in the rest of the page. Therefore, it is more likely that the average word-length of these lines will exceed the threshold of 6. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which includes more varied types of text, making it less likely that the average word-length will exceed 6.
