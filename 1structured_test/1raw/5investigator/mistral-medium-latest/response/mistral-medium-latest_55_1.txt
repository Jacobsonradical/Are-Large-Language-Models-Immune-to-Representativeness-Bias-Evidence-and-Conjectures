{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that Investigator 1's computation is based on the entire page, which averages out the word-length and may result in fewer instances of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. On the other hand, Investigator 2's computation is based on the first line of each page, which is more likely to have a higher average word-length than the page as a whole, especially if the line contains longer words or fewer words than average. Therefore, Investigator 2 may have recorded more instances of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
