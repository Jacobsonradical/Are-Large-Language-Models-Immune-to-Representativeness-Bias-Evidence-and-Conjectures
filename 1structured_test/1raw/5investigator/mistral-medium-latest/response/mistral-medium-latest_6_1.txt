{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 would have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of writing, such as starting with shorter words or using shorter words for impact. Therefore, the average word-length of these lines is likely to be higher than the average word-length of the entire page, making it more likely to have a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
