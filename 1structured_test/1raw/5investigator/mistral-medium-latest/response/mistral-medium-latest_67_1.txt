{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the sample size used by Investigator 2 (the first line of each page) is smaller than the sample size used by Investigator 1 (the entire page). As a result, it is more likely that the average word-length of a single line will deviate more from the overall average than the average of an entire page. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 will find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 will find pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
