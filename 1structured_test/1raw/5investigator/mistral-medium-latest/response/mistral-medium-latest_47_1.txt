{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more) than Investigator 1 for the following reasons:

1. The average word-length in the entire book is 4, which means that most pages and lines will have an average word-length lower than 6.
2. Investigator 1 computed the average word-length for entire pages, which means that the average is likely to be more stable and closer to the overall average of 4. This is because the larger sample size of words on each page will reduce the impact of any individual long or short words.
3. Investigator 2, on the other hand, only looked at the first line of each page. This means that the sample size is much smaller, and the average word-length is more likely to be influenced by any individual long or short words.
4. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 will find a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, simply because the smaller sample size makes it easier for a few long words to skew the average.
