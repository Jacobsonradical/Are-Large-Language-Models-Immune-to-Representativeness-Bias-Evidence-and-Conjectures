investigator: 2

Explanation:

Investigator 1 is looking at the average word length of entire pages, which is likely to be closer to the overall average of 4 words per line. On the other hand, Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page. Since the first line of a page might be an outlier in terms of word length (e.g., a short title or a long run-on sentence), it is more likely that Investigator 2 will find more lines with an average word length of 6 or more. Therefore, I would expect Investigator 2 to record a larger number of such units.
