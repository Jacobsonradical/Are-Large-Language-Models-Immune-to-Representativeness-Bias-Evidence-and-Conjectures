{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which may not be representative of the rest of the page. The first line of a page often contains longer words, such as the title of a chapter or section, which can skew the average word-length upwards. Investigator 1, on the other hand, is looking at the entire page, which should be more representative of the average word-length of the book as a whole. Therefore, it is less likely that Investigator 1 will find as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
