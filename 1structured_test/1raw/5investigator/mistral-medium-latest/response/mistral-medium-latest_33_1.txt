{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at individual lines, which are shorter than full pages. Since the overall average word-length in the book is 4, it is more likely that individual lines will have a higher average word-length than full pages, especially if those lines contain fewer words. Therefore, Investigator 2 is likely to have found more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 found pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
