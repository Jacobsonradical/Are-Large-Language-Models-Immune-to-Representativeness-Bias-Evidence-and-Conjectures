{investigator: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that Investigator 2 is looking at individual lines, while Investigator 1 is looking at entire pages. Since the average word length is 4, it is more likely that single lines will have a higher average word length than entire pages. This is because a line with only a few words can easily have an average word length of 6 or more, while it would be more difficult for an entire page to have such a high average word length. Therefore, Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more.
