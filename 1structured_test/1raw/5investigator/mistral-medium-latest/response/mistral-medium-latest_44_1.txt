{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of sentence construction and the need to grab the reader's attention at the beginning of a chapter or section. Therefore, it is more likely that the average word-length of the first line will exceed 6 if there are any longer words present in that line. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length of the entire page, which will be lowered by the presence of shorter words elsewhere on the page. Therefore, it is less likely that Investigator 1 will find as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
