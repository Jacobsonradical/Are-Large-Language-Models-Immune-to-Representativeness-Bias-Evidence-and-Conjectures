{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, as compared to Investigator 1 who looked at entire pages.

The reasoning behind this is that lines in a book tend to have more variation in word length than entire pages. For example, a page may have an average word length of 4, but it could still contain a few lines with longer words that bring up the overall average. On the other hand, if Investigator 2 only looks at the first line of each page, they are more likely to encounter lines with higher average word lengths, as longer words are often used at the beginning of sentences or paragraphs. Additionally, since lines are shorter than pages, it is easier for outliers with longer words to skew the average word length.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more. However, without more specific data, it is impossible to say for sure.
