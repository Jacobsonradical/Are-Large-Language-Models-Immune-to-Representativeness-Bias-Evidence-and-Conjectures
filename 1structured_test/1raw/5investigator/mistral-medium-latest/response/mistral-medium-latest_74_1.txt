{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at individual lines, which are likely to have fewer words than an entire page. Therefore, it is more likely that the average word-length of a line will be higher than the average word-length of a page. Additionally, the fact that the overall average word-length of the book is 4 suggests that there are likely to be some lines and pages with higher average word-lengths. However, since lines have fewer words than pages, it is more likely that a line will have an average word-length of 6 or more than a page will.
