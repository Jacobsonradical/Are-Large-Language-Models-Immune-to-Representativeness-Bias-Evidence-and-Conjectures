{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of sentence construction (e.g. starting with shorter pronouns or articles). As a result, the average word-length of the first line is likely to be lower than the average word-length of the entire page. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 will find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, since those lines would have to have longer words to compensate for the shorter words in the rest of the line. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length of the entire page, which is less likely to have as many extremely long words, since the average word-length is only 4. Therefore, Investigator 1 is less likely to find pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
