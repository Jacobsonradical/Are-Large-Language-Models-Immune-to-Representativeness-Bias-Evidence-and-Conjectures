{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only considering the first line of each page, which is likely to have a smaller sample size compared to the entire page. With a smaller sample size, it is more likely that the average word-length will be higher than the overall average of 4, and therefore more likely to meet the threshold of 6 or more. In contrast, Investigator 1 is considering the entire page, which has a larger sample size and is more likely to have an average word-length that is closer to the overall average of 4. Therefore, Investigator 1 is less likely to record as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 2.
