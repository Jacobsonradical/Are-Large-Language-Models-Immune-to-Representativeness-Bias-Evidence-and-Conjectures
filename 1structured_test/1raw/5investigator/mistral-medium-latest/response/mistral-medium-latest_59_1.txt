{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the convention of starting sentences with shorter, simpler words. Therefore, the average word-length of the first line is likely to be lower than the average word-length of the entire page. As a result, there will be fewer instances where the average word-length of the first line is 6 or more, making it more likely for Investigator 2 to find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more when looking at the entire book. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length of each page, which is likely to be closer to the overall average of 4, making it less likely to find pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
