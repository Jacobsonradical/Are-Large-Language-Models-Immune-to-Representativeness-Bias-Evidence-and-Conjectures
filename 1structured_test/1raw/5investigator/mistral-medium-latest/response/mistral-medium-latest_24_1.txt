{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because lines typically have fewer words than entire pages, so it would be easier for the average word-length of a line to be skewed higher by a few longer words. In contrast, the average word-length of an entire page would be more stable and less likely to be above 6, since it is based on a larger sample of words.
