{investigator: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to contain shorter words (e.g. "Chapter", "The", "But", "And", etc.) due to the conventions of written language. Therefore, the average word length of the first line is likely to be lower than the average word length of the entire page. As a result, it is less likely that Investigator 2 will find lines with an average word length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 1 who is looking at the word length distribution across the entire page. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 1 recorded a larger number of such pages. However, without more information about the distribution of word lengths in the book, it is difficult to say for certain.

Note: The 5% threshold in the question is somewhat arbitrary, but assuming that the distribution of word lengths is roughly normal, a difference of 5% would be relatively small and could be within the margin of error for the sample sizes used by the investigators. Therefore, it is possible that the difference between the two investigators' counts could be within 5%, but without more information, it is difficult to say for certain.
