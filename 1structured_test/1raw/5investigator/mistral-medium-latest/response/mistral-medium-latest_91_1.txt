{investigator: 2}

My reasoning is that since the average word length is 4, it is more likely for a line with fewer words to have an average word length of 6 or more, compared to an entire page with many words. Therefore, Investigator 2, who analyzed the first line of each page, is more likely to have found a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
