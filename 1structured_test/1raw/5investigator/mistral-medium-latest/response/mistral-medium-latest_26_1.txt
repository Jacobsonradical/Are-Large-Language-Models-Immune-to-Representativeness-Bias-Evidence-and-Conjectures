{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because when considering only the first line of each page, it is more probable to find longer words compared to the average word-length of the entire page or the entire book. This is due to the common practice of using longer, more complex words in the beginning of a chapter or section to introduce new concepts or ideas. Additionally, the sample size for Investigator 2 is larger (number of lines) compared to Investigator 1 (number of pages), which increases the chances of finding lines with a higher average word-length.
