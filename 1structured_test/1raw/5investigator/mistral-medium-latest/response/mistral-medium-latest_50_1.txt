{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, because the sample size for Investigator 2's measurements is smaller. When calculating the average word-length for a line, it is easier for a single longer word to skew the average upwards compared to when calculating the average word-length for an entire page. This means that Investigator 2 is more likely to encounter lines with high average word-lengths than Investigator 1 is to encounter pages with high average word-lengths.
