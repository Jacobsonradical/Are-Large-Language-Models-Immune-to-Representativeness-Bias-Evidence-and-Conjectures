{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the convention of starting a chapter or section with shorter sentences or phrases that introduce the topic. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which would include longer and more complex sentences, making it less likely for the average word-length of the entire page to be 6 or more. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 is to find pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
