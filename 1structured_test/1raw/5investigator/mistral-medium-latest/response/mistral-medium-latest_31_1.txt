{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 1. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to be a sentence or a fragment that is intended to hook the reader's attention. As a result, the first line may contain shorter words or shorter sentences than the rest of the page, which could skew the average word-length upwards.

In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length for the entire page, which would be more representative of the overall language use in the book. While some pages may have an average word-length of 6 or more, it is less likely that a large number of pages would have such a high average word-length compared to the first lines of each page.

Therefore, I think Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
