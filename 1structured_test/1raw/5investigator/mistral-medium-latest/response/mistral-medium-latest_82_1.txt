{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of sentence structure and grammar. This means that there is a greater chance of finding a line with an average word-length of 6 or more than finding an entire page with that average. Additionally, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length for the entire page, which includes more words and is therefore more likely to be closer to the overall average word-length of 4. As a result, Investigator 1 is likely to find fewer pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.

However, it's worth noting that this is just an educated guess based on the information provided, and the actual results could be different depending on the specific properties of the language used in the book. Without more information, it's impossible to say for certain which investigator recorded a larger number of units.
