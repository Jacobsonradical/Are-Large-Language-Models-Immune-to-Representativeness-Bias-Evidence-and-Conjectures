{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more because they are only considering the first line of each page. Since the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it is likely that there are some longer words that contribute to lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. By only considering the first line of each page, Investigator 2 is more likely to capture these longer words and therefore record more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is considering the average word-length of the entire page, which is more likely to be closer to the overall average of 4. Therefore, they are less likely to record as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
