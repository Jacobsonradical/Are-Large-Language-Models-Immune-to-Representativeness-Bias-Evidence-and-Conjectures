{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Since the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it's expected that there will be a distribution of word-lengths around this value.
2. The longer lines (with more words) will have more opportunities to have higher average word-lengths compared to shorter lines.
3. When Investigator 1 computes the average word-length per page, they are averaging the word-lengths of all lines on that page. This will tend to bring down the average word-length, even if there are a few lines with very long words.
4. On the other hand, Investigator 2 is considering only the first line on each page. If that line happens to have a higher-than-average number of long words, it will be more likely to have an average word-length of 6 or more, without being "diluted" by the shorter words on the rest of the page.
5. Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 2 will have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Note: This is an educated guess based on the given information and some assumptions about the distribution of word-lengths in the text. Without more information, it's impossible to be certain.
