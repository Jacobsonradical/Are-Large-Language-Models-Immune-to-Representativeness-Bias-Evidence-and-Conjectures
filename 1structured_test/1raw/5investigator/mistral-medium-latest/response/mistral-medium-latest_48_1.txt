{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because investigator 1's method of computing the average word-length per page would tend to yield lower averages due to the law of large numbers. In other words, the more words that are included in the average, the more likely it is that the average will be closer to the overall average of 4. On the other hand, investigator 2's method of computing the average word-length per line would tend to yield higher averages, since there are fewer words in each line, and thus more variability in the average word-length. This would make it more likely for investigator 2 to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
