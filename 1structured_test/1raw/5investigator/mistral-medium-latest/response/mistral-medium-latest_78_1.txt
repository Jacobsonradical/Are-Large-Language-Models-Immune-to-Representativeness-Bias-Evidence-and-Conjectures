{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of sentence structure and writing style. This means that it will be easier for the average word-length in the first line to exceed the threshold of 6. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length for the entire page, which is likely to be closer to the overall average of 4, making it less likely that the average word-length for the page as a whole will exceed the threshold of 6.
