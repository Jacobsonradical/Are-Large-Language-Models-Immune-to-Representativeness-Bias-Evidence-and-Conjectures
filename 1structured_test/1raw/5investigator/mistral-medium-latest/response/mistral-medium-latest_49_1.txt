{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 1's metric is based on the entire page, which includes many lines, and thus the average word-length for a page is less likely to be as high as 6 compared to the average word-length of a single line. Investigator 2's metric, on the other hand, is based on individual lines, which are more likely to have an average word-length of 6 or more than an entire page.
