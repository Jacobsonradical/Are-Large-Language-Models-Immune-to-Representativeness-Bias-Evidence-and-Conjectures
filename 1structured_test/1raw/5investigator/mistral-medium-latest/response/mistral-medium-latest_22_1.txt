{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more.

This is because the sample size for Investigator 2 is smaller (only the first line of each page) compared to Investigator 1 (who looked at the entire page). When the sample size is smaller, it is more likely that extreme values (such as average word-length of 6 or more) will occur by chance. This phenomenon is known as sampling variability.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 who recorded pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
