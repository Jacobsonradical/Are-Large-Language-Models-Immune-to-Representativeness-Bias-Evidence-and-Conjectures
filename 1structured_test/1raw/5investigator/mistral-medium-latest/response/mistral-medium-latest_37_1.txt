{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of writing, such as starting a sentence with a pronoun or an article. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length of the entire page, which includes longer words in the middle and end of the page. Therefore, the average word-length of the first line is likely to be higher than the average word-length of the entire page, leading Investigator 2 to record more units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
