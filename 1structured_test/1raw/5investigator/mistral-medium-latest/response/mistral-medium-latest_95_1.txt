{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to be a title or a topic sentence and therefore may contain longer words than the average for the entire page. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length for the entire page, which is likely to be lower than the average for the first line. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
