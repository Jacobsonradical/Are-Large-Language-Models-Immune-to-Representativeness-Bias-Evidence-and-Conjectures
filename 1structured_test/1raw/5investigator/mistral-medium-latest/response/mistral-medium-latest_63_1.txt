{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, while Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page. Since the average word-length for the entire book is 4, it is likely that the majority of lines and pages will have an average word-length that is lower than 6. However, since Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, they are more likely to encounter lines with longer words, which could result in a higher average word-length for those lines. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which would include both shorter and longer words, and therefore is less likely to have as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.

It is also worth noting that the difference in the number of units recorded by the two investigators could be affected by the length of the lines and pages in the book. If the lines and pages are very short, then it is more likely that Investigator 2 will have a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, since they are only looking at the first line of each page. On the other hand, if the lines and pages are very long, then it is more likely that Investigator 1 will have a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, since they are looking at the entire page.

Overall, I think it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, but it is difficult to say for certain without more information about the length of the lines and pages in the book.
