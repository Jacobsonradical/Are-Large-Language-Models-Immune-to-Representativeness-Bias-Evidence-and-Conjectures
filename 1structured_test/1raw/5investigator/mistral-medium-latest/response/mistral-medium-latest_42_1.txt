{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more, as they are looking at individual lines rather than entire pages. This means they have more units of analysis, increasing the chances of encountering lines with longer words. Additionally, the average word-length of a single line is likely to vary more than that of an entire page, again increasing the likelihood of encountering longer lines. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that Investigator 2 recorded more units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
