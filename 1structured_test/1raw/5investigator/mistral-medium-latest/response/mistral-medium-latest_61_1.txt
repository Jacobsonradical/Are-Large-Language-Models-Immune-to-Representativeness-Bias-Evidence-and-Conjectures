{investigator: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that Investigator 2 is analyzing individual lines while Investigator 1 is analyzing entire pages. Since the average word length for the entire book is 4, it is likely that there are fewer words per line than per page. This means that Investigator 2 has a higher chance of encountering lines with an average word length of 6 or more, since a shorter sequence of words is more likely to have an above-average word length than a longer sequence. Therefore, Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units.
