{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is a smaller sample size than Investigator 1's sample size of the entire page. With a smaller sample size, there is a greater chance of having extreme values, such as a high average word-length. Additionally, the first line of a page may be more likely to contain longer words for stylistic or rhetorical reasons. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect Investigator 2 to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 recorded pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
