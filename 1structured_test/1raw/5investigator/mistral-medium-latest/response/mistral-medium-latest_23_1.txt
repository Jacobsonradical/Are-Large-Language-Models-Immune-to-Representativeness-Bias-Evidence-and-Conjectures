{investigator: 2}

Explanation: Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the sample size for Investigator 2's measurements is smaller (one line per page) compared to Investigator 1's measurements (all words on a page). Therefore, it is more likely for a shorter line to have a higher average word-length compared to a longer page with more words. Additionally, the average word-length for the entire book is 4, which is lower than the threshold of 6 used by the investigators. This further supports the conclusion that Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
