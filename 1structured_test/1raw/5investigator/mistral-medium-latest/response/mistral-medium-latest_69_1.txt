{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is a much smaller sample size than what Investigator 1 is analyzing (an entire page). Since the average word-length in the book is 4, it is more likely that a single line of text will have a higher average word-length than an entire page, simply due to statistical variability. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 is to find pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
