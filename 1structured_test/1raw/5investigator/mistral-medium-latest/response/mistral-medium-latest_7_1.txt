{investigator: 2}

My reasoning is that Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 only looked at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of sentence structure and the need to grab the reader's attention at the beginning of a chapter or section. Therefore, the average word-length of the first line is likely to be lower than the average word-length of the entire page, making it less likely that Investigator 2 will find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. However, Investigator 1 looked at the entire page, which includes longer and more complex sentences, increasing the likelihood of finding pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, even though their sample size is smaller. However, without more information, it is difficult to say whether the difference would be significant enough to rule out the possibility that they are within 5% of each other.
