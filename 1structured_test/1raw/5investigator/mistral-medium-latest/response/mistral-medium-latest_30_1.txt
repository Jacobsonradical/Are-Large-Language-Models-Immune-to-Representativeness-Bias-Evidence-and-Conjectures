{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of writing style, such as using shorter words at the beginning of a paragraph for clarity and ease of reading. Therefore, it is more likely that an occasional longer word in the first line will result in an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 1 who is looking at the average word-length for the entire page. Additionally, Investigator 1's count of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more is likely to be lower due to the law of large numbers, which states that the average of a larger sample size is more likely to be closer to the true mean. In this case, the true mean is 4, so the average word-length of an entire page is more likely to be closer to 4 than the average word-length of a single line.
