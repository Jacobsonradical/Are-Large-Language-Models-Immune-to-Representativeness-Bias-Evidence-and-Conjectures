{investigator: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that, on average, the first line of a page is likely to have shorter words compared to the entire page. This is because authors often use shorter, attention-grabbing words or phrases at the beginning of a page to draw the reader in. Therefore, Investigator 2, who is looking at the first lines of each page, is more likely to find a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 1 who is looking at the entire page.
