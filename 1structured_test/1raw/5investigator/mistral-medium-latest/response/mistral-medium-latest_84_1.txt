{investigator: 2}

Explanation:
Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of sentence structure and the need for a hook at the beginning of a chapter or section. Investigator 1, on the other hand, is looking at the average word-length for the entire page, which is likely to be closer to the overall average of 4. Therefore, there are likely to be fewer pages with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of first lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
