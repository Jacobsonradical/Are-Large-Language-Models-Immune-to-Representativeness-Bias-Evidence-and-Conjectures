{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of sentence structure and style. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length of the entire page, which is likely to be closer to the overall average of 4. Therefore, it is less likely that a whole page will have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to just the first line.
