{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because lines typically have fewer words than entire pages, so it would be easier for the average word-length in a line to be higher than the overall average word-length in the book. In contrast, an entire page with an average word-length of 6 or more would require a larger number of longer words to offset the shorter words, making it less likely to occur. Therefore, Investigator 1 is likely to have recorded fewer pages with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 2 recorded lines with the same average word-length.
