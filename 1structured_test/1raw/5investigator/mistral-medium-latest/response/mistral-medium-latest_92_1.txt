{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to be a title or a heading and therefore more likely to contain longer words. Investigator 1, on the other hand, is looking at the average word-length for the entire page, which includes many more words and is therefore less likely to have an average word-length of 6 or more.

Note: This answer assumes that the distribution of word lengths in the book is such that there are more words with a length of less than 6 than there are words with a length of 6 or more. If the distribution of word lengths is different, then the answer may be different as well.
