{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 who looked at entire pages. The reason is that lines, especially the first lines of a page, might be more likely to contain longer words for emphasis or stylistic reasons, while the overall average word-length on a page tends to be lower due to the presence of shorter function words and common phrases. Therefore, Investigator 2 might have encountered more instances of longer words in their analysis, leading to a higher count of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
