{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which may not be representative of the entire page. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length for the entire page, which is more likely to be closer to the overall average word-length of 4 for the book. Therefore, it is less likely that a whole page would have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to just the first line of a page.
