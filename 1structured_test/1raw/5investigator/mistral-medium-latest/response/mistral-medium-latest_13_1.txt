{investigator: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that Investigator 2 is looking at individual lines, which are likely to have fewer words than entire pages. Therefore, each word in a line has a greater impact on the average word-length of that line compared to a page with many more words. This means that it is more likely for Investigator 2 to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than for Investigator 1 to find pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
