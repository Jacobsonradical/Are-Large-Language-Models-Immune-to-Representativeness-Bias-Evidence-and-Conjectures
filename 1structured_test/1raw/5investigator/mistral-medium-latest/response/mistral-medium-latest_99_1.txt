{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because a single line is more likely to have a higher average word-length than an entire page, simply due to the fact that the sample size is smaller. With fewer words in a line, it is easier for one or two longer words to skew the average word-length higher. On the other hand, an entire page has more words, which can help to balance out any outliers and bring the average word-length closer to the overall average of 4. Therefore, it is less likely that an entire page would have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to a single line.
