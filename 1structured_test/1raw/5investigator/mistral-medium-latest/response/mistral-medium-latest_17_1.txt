investigator: 2

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the presence of titles, chapter headings, or other introductory text. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which is likely to have a more representative sample of the book's language and thus a lower average word-length. Therefore, it is less likely that Investigator 1 will find as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
