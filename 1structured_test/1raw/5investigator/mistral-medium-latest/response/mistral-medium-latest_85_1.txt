{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of writing, such as using shorter sentences and more common words at the beginning of a paragraph. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length of the entire page, which includes longer and more complex sentences that are likely to have longer words. Therefore, it is less likely that Investigator 1 will find as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 2 finding lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
