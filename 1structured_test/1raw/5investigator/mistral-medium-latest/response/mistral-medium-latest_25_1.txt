{investigator: 2}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Investigator 1 looked at the average word-length on each page. Since the overall average word-length in the book is 4, we would expect most pages to have an average word-length close to 4.
2. Investigator 2, on the other hand, only looked at the first line of each page. It's more likely that the first line of a page will have a higher average word-length than the rest of the page, since authors often use longer words and more complex sentences at the beginning of a page to introduce new ideas.
3. Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 2 found more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 found pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Note: This answer is based on the assumption that the distribution of word-lengths in the book is roughly normal or bell-shaped. If the distribution is highly skewed or has multiple peaks, the answer could be different.
