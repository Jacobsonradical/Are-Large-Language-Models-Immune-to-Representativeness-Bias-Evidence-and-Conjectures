{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because when considering only the first line of each page, there is a smaller sample size of words compared to considering all words on the page as Investigator 1 did. A smaller sample size makes it more likely for extreme values, such as an average word-length of 6 or more, to occur simply by chance. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to have encountered more lines with longer average word-lengths.
