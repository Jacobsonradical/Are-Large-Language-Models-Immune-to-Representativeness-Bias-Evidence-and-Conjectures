{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of writing that favor shorter words at the beginning of sentences. This means that the average word-length of the first line is likely to be less than the average word-length of the entire page. As a result, Investigator 1's count of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more may be lower than Investigator 2's count of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
