{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first lines of each page, which are more likely to have longer words due to the presence of proper nouns, titles, and introductory phrases. Investigator 1, on the other hand, is looking at the average word length of the entire page, which is likely to be more representative of the overall average word length of the book.

Additionally, the number of lines that Investigator 2 looks at is likely to be much larger than the number of pages that Investigator 1 looks at, simply because there are usually more lines on a page than there are pages in a book. This means that Investigator 2 has more opportunities to find lines with an average word length of 6 or more.

Overall, I would expect Investigator 2 to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word length of 6 or more, so my answer is 2.
