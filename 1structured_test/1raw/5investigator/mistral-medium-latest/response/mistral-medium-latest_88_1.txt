{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, while Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page. The first line of a page may be more likely to have longer words, such as in a chapter title or a descriptive sentence, than a random selection of words from the page as a whole. Therefore, Investigator 2's sample is more likely to include lines with longer words, leading to a higher count of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
