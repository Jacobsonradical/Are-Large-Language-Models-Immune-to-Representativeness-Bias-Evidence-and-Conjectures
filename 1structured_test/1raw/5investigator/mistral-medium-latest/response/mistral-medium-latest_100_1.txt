{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 only considered the first line of each page, which may not be representative of the entire page. In contrast, Investigator 1 considered all the words on each page, making it less likely to find pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Additionally, the average word-length in the entire book is 4, so it is less likely for pages to have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to lines. This also supports the conclusion that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
