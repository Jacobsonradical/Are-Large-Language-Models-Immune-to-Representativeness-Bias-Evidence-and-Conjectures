{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of sentence and paragraph construction. In particular, the first line often contains shorter words such as articles, conjunctions, and prepositions. As a result, the average word-length of the first line is likely to be lower than the average word-length of the entire page, making it less likely that the first line will have an average word-length of 6 or more.

On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length of the entire page, which includes all the words on the page, not just those in the first line. Therefore, it is more likely that some pages will have an average word-length of 6 or more, simply due to the larger sample size of words on each page.

Overall, while there may be some variation depending on the specific book being studied, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
