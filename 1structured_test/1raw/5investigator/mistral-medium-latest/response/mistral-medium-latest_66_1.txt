{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to be a title or a heading, and therefore may contain longer words. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length for the entire page, which includes more text and is therefore likely to be closer to the overall average of 4.
