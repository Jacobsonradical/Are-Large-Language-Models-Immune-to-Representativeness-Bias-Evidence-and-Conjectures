{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the sample size for Investigator 2's calculations is smaller (only the first line of each page) compared to Investigator 1's calculations (the entire page). Therefore, it is more likely for the average word-length of a single line to be higher than the average word-length of an entire page. Additionally, since the overall average word-length of the book is 4, it is less likely for an entire page to have an average word-length of 6 or more compared to a single line. Hence, Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
