{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of sentence construction (e.g. starting with a pronoun or article). Therefore, it will be easier for the average word-length of that line to exceed 6 if there are one or two longer words. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length for the entire page, which will be more representative of the overall average word-length of 4, making it less likely for a page to have an average word-length of 6 or more.
