{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because when computing the average word-length of a single line, it is more likely to have a higher average compared to an entire page. This is due to the fact that a single line may contain only a few words, and if those words are long, it will significantly increase the average word-length of that line. On the other hand, an entire page contains many more words, and the average word-length is less likely to be as high due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to have encountered more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 encountered pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
