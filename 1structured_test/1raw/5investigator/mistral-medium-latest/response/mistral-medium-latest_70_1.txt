{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason for this is that the first line of a page may have longer words due to the presence of proper nouns, titles, or complex sentences starting a new thought or section. In contrast, Investigator 1's average word-length for each page is more likely to be closer to the overall average of 4, as it takes into account the word-length of all lines on the page. Therefore, Investigator 2's count of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more is likely to be higher than Investigator 1's count of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
