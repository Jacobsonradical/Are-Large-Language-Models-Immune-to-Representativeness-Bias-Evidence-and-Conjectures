{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to be a title or a topic sentence. Titles and topic sentences often contain longer words than the rest of the text, in order to convey the main idea or theme of the page. Therefore, it is more likely that the average word-length of these lines will be higher than 6, compared to the average word-length of an entire page, which includes more varied types of sentences and vocabulary.

However, it is worth noting that this is just a likelihood based on common patterns in language use, and the actual results may vary depending on the specific book being studied. Additionally, the difference between the two investigators' counts may not be large enough to be statistically significant, so it is possible that they are within 5% of each other. Nonetheless, based on the information provided, it seems more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
