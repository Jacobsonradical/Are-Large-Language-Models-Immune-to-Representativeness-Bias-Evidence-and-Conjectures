{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to Investigator 1 who looked at entire pages. This is because the sample size for Investigator 2's calculations is smaller (one line versus an entire page), making it more likely that an individual line will have a higher average word-length than the average for the entire book. Additionally, the first line of a page may be intentionally written with longer words to grab the reader's attention, further increasing the chances of Investigator 2 observing more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
