{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1's pages. This is because lines typically have fewer words than entire pages. Since both investigators are looking for instances of higher-than-average word-lengths, it's more likely that Investigator 2 will find more such instances in the first lines of pages than Investigator 1 will find across whole pages. This is due to the lower number of words in a line providing a greater chance for a higher average word-length, as extreme values have a more significant impact on smaller sample sizes.

However, without specific data or additional context, this answer is based on general probabilities and may not hold true for every book or dataset.
