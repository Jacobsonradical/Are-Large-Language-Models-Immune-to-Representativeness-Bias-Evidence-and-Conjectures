{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the sample size used by Investigator 2 (the first line of each page) is much smaller than the sample size used by Investigator 1 (the entire page). As a result, the average word-length in the first line of each page is more likely to vary from the overall average word-length of 4, and therefore more likely to be 6 or more. In contrast, the average word-length of an entire page is more likely to be closer to the overall average of 4, since it is based on a larger sample size. Therefore, Investigator 1 is less likely to find as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
