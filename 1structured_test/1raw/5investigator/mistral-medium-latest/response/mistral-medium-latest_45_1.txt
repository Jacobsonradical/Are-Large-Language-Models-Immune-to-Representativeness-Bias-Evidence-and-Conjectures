investigator: 2

Explanation:

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more because they are looking at the first line of each page. These lines are likely to be shorter due to the presence of titles, headings, or chapter numbers, which can have very short words or even single letters. This would artificially inflate the average word-length of those lines, making it more likely for them to exceed the threshold of 6. In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length of entire pages, which would be more representative of the overall language use in the book and less likely to be inflated by short titles or headings. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

Note: This answer assumes that the distribution of word lengths in the book is roughly normal or symmetric. If the distribution is heavily skewed towards longer words, then Investigator 1 may have recorded a larger number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. However, the question does not provide any information about the distribution of word lengths, so this answer is based on the assumption of a symmetric distribution.
