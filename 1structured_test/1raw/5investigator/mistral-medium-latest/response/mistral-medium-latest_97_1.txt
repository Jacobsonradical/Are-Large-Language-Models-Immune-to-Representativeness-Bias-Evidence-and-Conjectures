{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, while Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page. Since the average word-length in the book is 4, it is more likely that the first line of a page will have a higher average word-length than the entire page, as the first line may be a topic sentence or have longer words to introduce the content of the page. Therefore, Investigator 2 has a higher chance of finding lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
