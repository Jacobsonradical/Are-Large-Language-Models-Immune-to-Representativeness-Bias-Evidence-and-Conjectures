{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that the sample size for Investigator 2 is smaller (average word-length of the first line only) compared to Investigator 1 (average word-length of the entire page). Therefore, it is more likely for Investigator 2 to have a higher average word-length in that smaller sample size.
