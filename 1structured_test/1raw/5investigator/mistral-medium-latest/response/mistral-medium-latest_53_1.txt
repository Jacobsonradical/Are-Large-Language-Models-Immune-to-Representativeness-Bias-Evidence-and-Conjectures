{investigator: 2}

The average word-length in the entire book is 4, so lines with an average word-length of 6 or more would be considered longer than average. It's more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units since they analyzed the first line of each page, which may be more likely to contain longer words due to the presence of titles, chapter headings, or introductory phrases. Investigator 1 analyzed the entire page, which may include more varied word lengths and thus be less likely to have an average word-length of 6 or more.
