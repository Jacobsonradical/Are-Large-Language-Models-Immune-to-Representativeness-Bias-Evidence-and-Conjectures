{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have shorter words due to the conventions of writing and printing, such as using shorter words for titles and headings. Therefore, it is more likely that the average word-length of these lines will exceed the overall average of 4 and be closer to 6. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length of every page, which includes a larger sample of words and is more likely to reflect the overall average of 4, making it less likely that a significant number of pages will have an average word-length of 6 or more.
