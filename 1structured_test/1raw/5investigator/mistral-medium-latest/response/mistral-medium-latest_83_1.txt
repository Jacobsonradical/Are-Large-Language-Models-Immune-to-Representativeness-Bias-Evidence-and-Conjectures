{investigator: 2}

The reasoning behind this answer is that Investigator 2 is looking at individual lines, while Investigator 1 is considering entire pages. Since the average word-length in the entire book is 4, it is more likely that a smaller unit, such as a single line, will have a higher average word-length compared to a larger unit, such as a page. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
