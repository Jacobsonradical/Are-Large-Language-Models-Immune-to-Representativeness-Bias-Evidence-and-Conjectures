{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.

The reason for this is that Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to be a shorter line with fewer words. Since the average word-length in the entire book is 4, shorter lines are likely to have a higher average word-length. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which includes longer lines with more words, and therefore a lower average word-length. Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 2 will find a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

However, it's worth noting that this is just an educated guess based on the information provided, and it's possible that other factors could influence the results. For example, if the book has a lot of short pages with few lines, Investigator 1 might actually find more pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. But based on the information given, I would guess that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
