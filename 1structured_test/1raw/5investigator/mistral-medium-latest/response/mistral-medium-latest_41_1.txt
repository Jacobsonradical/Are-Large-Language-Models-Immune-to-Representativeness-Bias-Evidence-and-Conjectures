{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the sample size for Investigator 2's analysis is smaller (one line per page) compared to Investigator 1's analysis (whole pages). With a smaller sample size, it is more likely to have extreme values (in this case, higher average word-length) due to random chance. Therefore, Investigator 2 would have a higher chance of finding lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 finding pages with the same average word-length.
