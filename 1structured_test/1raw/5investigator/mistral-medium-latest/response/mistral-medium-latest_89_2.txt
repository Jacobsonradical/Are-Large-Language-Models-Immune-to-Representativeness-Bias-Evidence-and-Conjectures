{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is more likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the sample size used by Investigator 2 is smaller (only the first line of each page) compared to Investigator 1, who considered the entire page. Therefore, it is more probable that a short sequence of words (like the first line of a page) will have an average word-length that deviates more from the overall average of 4, and thus have a higher chance of exceeding 6.
