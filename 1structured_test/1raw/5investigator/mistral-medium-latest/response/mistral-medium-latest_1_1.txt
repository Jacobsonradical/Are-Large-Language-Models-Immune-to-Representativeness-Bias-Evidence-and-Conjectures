{investigator: 2}

Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason for this is that the sample size for Investigator 2 is smaller (only the first line of each page) compared to Investigator 1 (who looked at the entire page). With a smaller sample size, there is a greater chance of having extreme values, such as a higher average word-length. This means that Investigator 2 is more likely to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, leading to a larger count.
