Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of units (lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, which is likely to have a higher average word-length due to the presence of longer words at the beginning of a chapter or section. Investigator 1, on the other hand, is looking at the average word-length of every page, which is more likely to be closer to the overall average of 4.

Therefore, my answer is:
{investigator: 2}

Please note that this is an educated guess based on the information provided and there is no definitive way to determine the answer without more data.
