{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with higher average word-lengths are likely to be more complex and less frequent than shorter words. By selecting the first line of each page, Investigator 2 is more likely to include these less frequent, complex words, leading to a higher count of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

While Investigator 1 is considering entire pages, which may also contain complex words, they are averaging the word-lengths over a larger number of words, which could dilute the impact of high-average-word-length words within a page. Therefore, Investigator 1 would be less likely to record as many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 2.
