{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because the distribution of word lengths may not be uniform throughout the book. It is more likely that individual lines have a higher concentration of words with an average word length of 6 or more compared to entire pages. This is because a single long word on a line can significantly increase the average word length for that line, whereas on a page level, short words can balance out the long words and bring down the overall average word length.
