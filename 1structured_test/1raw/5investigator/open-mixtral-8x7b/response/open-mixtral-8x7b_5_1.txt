{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines because they are focusing on the first line of each page, which may have a higher concentration of longer words due to the way sentences and paragraphs are structured. The first line of a page may often contain important or descriptive words, which could cause the average word length to be higher than the overall book average. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is averaging all the words on a page, which would dilute the effect of having a few longer words on one line. This is why I believe Investigator 2 would record a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
