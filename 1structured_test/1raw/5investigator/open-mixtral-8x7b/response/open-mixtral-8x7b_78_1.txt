{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). The reason for this is that words with an above-average length are likely to be spread more evenly throughout the text, rather than being consistent on every page. Therefore, it is more probable that Investigator 2 will find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 on a per-page basis.
