{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would most likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line in each page might have a higher concentration of longer words compared to the overall page average, which is diluted by the presence of shorter words in other parts of the page. Thus, the likelihood of finding a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to pages with that average is higher.
