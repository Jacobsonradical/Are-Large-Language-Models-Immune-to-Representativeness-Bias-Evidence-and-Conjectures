{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines because they are focusing on individual lines rather than entire pages. This approach has a higher chance of yielding lines with an average word length of 6 or more, as a single long word on a line can significantly impact its average word length. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is considering the entire page, which means that the impact of a single long word would be diluted across the page, making it less likely to reach the threshold of 6 or more for the average word length.
