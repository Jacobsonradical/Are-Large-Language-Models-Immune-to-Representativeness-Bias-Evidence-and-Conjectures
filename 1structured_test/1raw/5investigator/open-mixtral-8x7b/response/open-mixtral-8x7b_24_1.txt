{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines because they are focusing on the first line of each page, which might have a higher chance of having a higher average word-length due to the natural variation in language and writing style. While some pages may have lower average word-lengths in the remaining lines, the first line could still have an average word-length of 6 or more. This effect might lead Investigator 2 to count more units with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1.
