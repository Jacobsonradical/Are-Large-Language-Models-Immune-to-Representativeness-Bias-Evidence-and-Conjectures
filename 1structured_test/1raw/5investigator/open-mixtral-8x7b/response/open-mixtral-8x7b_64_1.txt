{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such lines because they are more likely to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to pages. This is because a page may contain a mix of words with different lengths, and it takes more words with an average length of 6 or more to increase the page average. However, a single line can have a higher concentration of longer words, making it more likely for Investigator 2 to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
