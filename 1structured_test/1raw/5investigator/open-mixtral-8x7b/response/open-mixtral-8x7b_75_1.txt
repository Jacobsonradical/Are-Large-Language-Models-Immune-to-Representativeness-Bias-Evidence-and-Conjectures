{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines because they are focusing on individual lines within each page. This method has a higher chance of finding lines with an average word length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who is considering entire pages as a whole. Since there can be variation in word length from line to line, some lines will have an average word length of 6 or more even when the overall page average is below 6. The difference may not be substantial, but I believe Investigator 2's count will be larger than Investigator 1's.
