{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines, compared to Investigator 1's page counts. This is because the first line of a page can have a significantly different average word-length compared to the rest of the page, especially if the page starts or ends with a short or long line. Thus, Investigator 2's method would capture more instances of higher average word-length lines, which would lead to a larger count than Investigator 1's page-based approach.
