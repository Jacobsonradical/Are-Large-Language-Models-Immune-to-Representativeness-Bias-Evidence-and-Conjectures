{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words with longer average lengths are likely to be more complex and less common than shorter words. Therefore, the chances of having at least one line with an average word-length of 6 or more in a page would be higher than having an entire page with an average word-length of 6 or more. This effect would lead Investigator 2 to count more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1.
