{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such lines. This is because words at the ends of lines or pages may often be longer, causing the average word-length in those lines to be higher. This phenomenon might not affect each page equally, but it is more likely to affect individual lines. Thus, Investigator 2 might find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1.
