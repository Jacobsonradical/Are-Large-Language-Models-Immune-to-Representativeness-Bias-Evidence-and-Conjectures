{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words with higher average word-lengths are likely to be more complex and less frequent, making it less likely for them to be evenly distributed across every page. It is more probable for Investigator 2 to find more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more since they focus on individual lines instead of entire pages.

Although there is a chance that both investigators' results could be within 5% of each other, based on the provided information, Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
