{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). The reason for this is that words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be relatively long and less common compared to shorter words. By focusing on individual lines rather than entire pages, Investigator 2 increases the likelihood of encountering a higher proportion of lines with longer words, especially since these lines might be distributed unevenly throughout the book.

In contrast, Investigator 1 is considering an entire page in each case, which would require a higher concentration of long words to achieve an average word length of 6 or more. This makes it statistically less probable to find as many pages with such an average compared to Investigator 2's method of examining individual lines.
