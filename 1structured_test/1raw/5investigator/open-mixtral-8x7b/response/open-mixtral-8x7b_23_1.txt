{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more) compared to Investigator 1 (pages with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an above-average length will have a more significant impact on the average word-length computed for a single line, as opposed to an entire page. Therefore, it is more likely that Investigator 2 will encounter more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, as they only consider the first line of each page.
