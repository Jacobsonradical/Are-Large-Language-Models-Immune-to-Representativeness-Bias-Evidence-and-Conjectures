{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of each page might have a higher concentration of longer words, resulting in a higher average word-length compared to the average word-length for the entire page (Investigator 1's method). Thus, Investigator 2 might identify more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
