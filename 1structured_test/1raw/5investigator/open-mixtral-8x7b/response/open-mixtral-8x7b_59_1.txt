{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines. This is because the selection of lines is more likely to have a higher average word-length than the entire page. Since the book's average word-length is 4, there are likely many short words distributed throughout the text. When selecting the first line of each page, Investigator 2 might be picking lines that contain longer words, which could result in a higher count of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This effect might be more pronounced than the difference in word-lengths across entire pages, as computed by Investigator 1.
