{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. The reason is that the first line of a page may contain shorter or longer words compared to the rest of the page. Thus, the likelihood of the first line having an average word-length of 6 or more is higher than the likelihood of an entire page having an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because a page may contain many words with an average length of 4, but the first line could still have a higher average word-length due to a few longer words. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to count more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1.
