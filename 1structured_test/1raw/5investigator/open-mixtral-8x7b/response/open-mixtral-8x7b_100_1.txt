{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be longer, more complex words, which might be less common than shorter words. Therefore, it's more likely that Investigator 2 will find a higher number of these longer word lines scattered throughout the pages rather than Investigator 1, who is looking at entire pages with an average word length of 6 or more. However, the difference might not be substantial and could be within a 5% margin.
