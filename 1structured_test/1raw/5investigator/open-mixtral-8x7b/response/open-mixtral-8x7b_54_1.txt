{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). The reason is that words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be relatively long and less common. When selecting the first line of each page, Investigator 2 has a higher chance of including these less common, longer words in their sample. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word length for an entire page, which may dilute the effect of these longer words as they are spread out across the page. Unless the pages have a very even distribution of words, Investigator 2's numbers are likely to be higher.
