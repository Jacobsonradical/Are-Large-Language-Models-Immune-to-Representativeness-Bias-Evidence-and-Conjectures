{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average word-length of 6 or more are likely to be longer and more complex words. These types of words might be less frequent compared to shorter, simpler words. Since Investigator 2 is focusing on only the first line of each page, the chances of encountering longer words in that line might be higher than the average word-length for the entire page (Investigator 1's approach). Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
