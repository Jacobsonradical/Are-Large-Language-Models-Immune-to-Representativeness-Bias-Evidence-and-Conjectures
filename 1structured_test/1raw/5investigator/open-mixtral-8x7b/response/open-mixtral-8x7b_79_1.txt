{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words with more than 6 letters are relatively common in the English language, and by selecting the first line of each page, Investigator 2 increases the chances of encountering those longer words. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is considering an entire page, which may contain a more balanced distribution of short and long words, leading to fewer pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. However, the difference in numbers might not be substantial.
