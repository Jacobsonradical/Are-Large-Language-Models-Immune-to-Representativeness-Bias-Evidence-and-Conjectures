{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. This is because the first line of a page may contain shorter or longer words compared to the rest of the page. It is possible that the first line has an easier chance of having a lower average word-length compared to the overall page average, making it more likely for Investigator 2 to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This difference might not be substantial, but I still think Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such units.
