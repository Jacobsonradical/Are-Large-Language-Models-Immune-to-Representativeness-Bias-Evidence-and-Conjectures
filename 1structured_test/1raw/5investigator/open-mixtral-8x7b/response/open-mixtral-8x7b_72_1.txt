{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words are not equally distributed across lines and pages; some lines might have shorter words, while others might have longer words. By focusing on individual lines instead of entire pages, Investigator 2 is more likely to capture lines with higher average word-lengths, since they would not be diluted by the presence of lower-scoring lines on the same page. This effect would likely result in Investigator 2 identifying more units (in this case, lines) with an average word-length of 6 or more.
