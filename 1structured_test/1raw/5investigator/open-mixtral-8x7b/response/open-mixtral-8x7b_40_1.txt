Investigator: 2

Justification: Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words with above-average lengths are likely to be distributed randomly throughout the text. When Investigator 1 calculates the average word-length for an entire page, the contribution of these high-length words could be diluted by the presence of many shorter words on the same page. However, when Investigator 2 computes the average word-length for the first line of each page, there is a higher chance that a line will consist of (or include) multiple high-length words, leading to a higher count of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
