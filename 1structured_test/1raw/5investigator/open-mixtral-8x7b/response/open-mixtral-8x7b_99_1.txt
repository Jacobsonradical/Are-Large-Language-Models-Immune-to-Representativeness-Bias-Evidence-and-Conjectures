{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words with more than six letters are relatively common, and the distribution of word lengths is not uniform throughout the text. For example, a line might have several short words and one long word, which would increase its average word length. In contrast, a page might have a more balanced distribution of short and long words, leading to a lower average word length compared to some individual lines. Thus, Investigator 2 would likely find more instances of lines with higher average word lengths.
