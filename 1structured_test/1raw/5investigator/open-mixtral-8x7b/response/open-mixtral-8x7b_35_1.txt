{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would most likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because in each page, there can be a significant variation in word lengths throughout the page, with the first line often containing shorter words or even just a single short word (like "The" or "A"). This would cause Investigator 2's average word length for that line to be lower than the overall page average, making it less likely to reach or exceed the threshold of 6. In contrast, Investigator 1's page-level measurement would be more likely to include longer words scattered throughout the page, leading to a higher likelihood of meeting the 6+ average word length criterion.
