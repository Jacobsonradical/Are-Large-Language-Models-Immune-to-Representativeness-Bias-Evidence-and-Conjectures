{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the choice of taking the first line in each page could result in a more variable selection of lines with different average word-lengths, whereas Investigator 1's method of calculating the average word-length for the entire page would likely result in a more consistent and perhaps lower average word-length. Therefore, it is more likely for Investigator 2 to encounter lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1.
