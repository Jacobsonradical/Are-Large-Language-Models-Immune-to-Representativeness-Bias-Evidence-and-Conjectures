{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would most likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that by selecting the first line of each page, Investigator 2 is potentially choosing lines that have longer words at the beginning of the page, which could result in a higher average word-length for that line. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is calculating the average word-length for an entire page, which includes a variety of sentences and word lengths, potentially balancing out the average. Thus, there is a higher chance that Investigator 2's line averages would be more likely to reach or exceed 6 compared to Investigator 1's page averages.
