{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). The reason is that words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be longer and more complex words. In a given line, it is more probable to find at least one longer word than in an entire page. This is because pages may contain many common words with average lengths below 6, which would balance out the longer words. In contrast, lines are shorter and might not have as many common words to balance out the longer ones. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to count a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
