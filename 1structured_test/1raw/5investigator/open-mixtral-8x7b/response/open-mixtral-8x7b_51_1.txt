{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page may not be representative of the entire page's average word-length. For example, the first line could contain shorter words while the rest of the page has longer words, or vice versa. This fluctuation in word length distribution is more likely to produce a higher count for Investigator 2 compared to Investigator 1.

Investigator 1, on the other hand, calculates the average word-length for the entire page, which would likely result in a more stable and consistent average. The chances of having many pages with an average word-length of 6 or more would be lower than the number of lines Investigator 2 encounters with that average word-length. Therefore, Investigator 2 is likely to record a larger number.
