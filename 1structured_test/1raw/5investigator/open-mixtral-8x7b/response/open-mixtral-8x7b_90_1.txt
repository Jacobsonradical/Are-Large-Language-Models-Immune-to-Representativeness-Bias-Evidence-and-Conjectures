{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be relatively long and less common than shorter words. By selecting the first line of each page, Investigator 2 is more likely to include these relatively long and less common words in their sample, since the first line of each page may contain more of these words than a typical line.

In contrast, Investigator 1 is considering entire pages, which are likely to be more diverse in their word lengths and therefore less likely to have a high average word length. While some pages may have a high average word length, this is less likely to be the case for a large number of pages compared to Investigator 2's sample of first lines.

Therefore, I would expect Investigator 2 to record a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
