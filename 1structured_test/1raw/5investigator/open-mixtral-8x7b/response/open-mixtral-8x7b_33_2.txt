{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because they are selecting the first line of each page, which may have a higher concentration of longer words due to the way sentences and paragraphs are structured. It is possible for a page to have a lower overall average word-length but still have one or more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, depending on the distribution of long and short words within that page.
