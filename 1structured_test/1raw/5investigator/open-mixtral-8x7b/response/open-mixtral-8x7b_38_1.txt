{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. This is because the first line in each page may have a higher concentration of longer words compared to the whole page, which would result in a higher average word-length. This effect might be more pronounced than the difference between the average word-lengths of individual pages and the overall book average.
