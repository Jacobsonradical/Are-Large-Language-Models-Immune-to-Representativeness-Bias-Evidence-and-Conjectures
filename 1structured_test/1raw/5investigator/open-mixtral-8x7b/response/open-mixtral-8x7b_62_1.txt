{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page might have a higher average word-length than the overall page average, as it may contain some longer words. On the other hand, the rest of the page could have a lower average word-length, balancing it out and making the overall page average equal to 4. This discrepancy would lead Investigator 2 to count more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1.
