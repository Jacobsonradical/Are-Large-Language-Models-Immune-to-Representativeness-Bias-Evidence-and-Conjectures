{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines. This is because the first line on a page may not be representative of the entire page. It is possible that the first line has several short words, which would result in a lower average word-length for that line, while the rest of the page has longer words. Conversely, it is also possible that the first line has several long words, resulting in a higher average word-length for that line.

Since the book's overall average word-length is 4, it is more likely that the first line's average word-length will deviate from 4 because of the reasons mentioned above. Additionally, since there are typically more words on a page than there are lines in a page, there is a higher likelihood that Investigator 2 will encounter more lines with average word-lengths of 6 or more, simply due to the larger sample size.

However, the difference in the number of such units recorded by the investigators might not be substantial enough to be more than 5% apart. It would depend on the specific distribution of word lengths in the book and the length of the lines. Nonetheless, based on the given information, I believe Investigator 2 would record more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 would record pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
