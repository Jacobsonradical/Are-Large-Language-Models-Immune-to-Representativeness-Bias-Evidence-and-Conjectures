{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words on a page are not evenly distributed, and some pages may have more longer words clustered together compared to the overall average of 4. On the other hand, Investigator 2 examines the first line of each page, which may have a higher probability of containing longer words, especially if the page starts with a proper noun, technical term, or a multi-syllable word. This effect would likely cause Investigator 2 to observe a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1.
