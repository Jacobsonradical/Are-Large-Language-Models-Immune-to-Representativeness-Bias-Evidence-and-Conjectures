{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be longer, more complex words. Since Investigator 2 is looking at individual lines, they have a higher chance of encountering these longer words than Investigator 1, who is averaging word lengths over an entire page. Thus, Investigator 2 is more likely to find a higher number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
