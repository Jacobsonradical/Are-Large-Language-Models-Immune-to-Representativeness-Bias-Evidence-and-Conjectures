{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words with higher average word-lengths are more likely to be found in a line than on an entire page. For example, a single line containing long words can significantly increase the line's average word-length, but it would have a smaller impact on the page's overall average word-length. Therefore, Investigator 2's method of measuring the first line on each page is more likely to capture these instances than Investigator 1's method of averaging the word lengths for an entire page.
