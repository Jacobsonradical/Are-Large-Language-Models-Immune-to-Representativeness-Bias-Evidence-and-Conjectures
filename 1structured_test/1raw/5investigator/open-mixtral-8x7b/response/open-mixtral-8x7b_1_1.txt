{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would most likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that when selecting only the first line of each page, there is a higher chance of encountering lines with longer words, especially if the page starts with a proper noun, technical term, or any other word with more than 6 letters. In contrast, Investigator 1 computes the average word-length for an entire page, diluting the effect of a few long words by the presence of many shorter words on the same page.

Therefore, I expect Investigator 2 to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1.
