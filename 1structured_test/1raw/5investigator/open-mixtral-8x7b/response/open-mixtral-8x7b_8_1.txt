{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average word-length of 6 or more are likely to be long words, and long words are more likely to appear in a single line compared to an entire page. This increases the probability of Investigator 2 encountering more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than Investigator 1.
