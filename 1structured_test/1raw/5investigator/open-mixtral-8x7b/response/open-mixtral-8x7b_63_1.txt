{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because by choosing only the first line of each page, Investigator 2 is selecting words in a context that might have a higher likelihood of containing longer words or technical terms, which can skew the average word-length. On the other hand, Investigator 1 computes the average word-length for an entire page, which would balance out the word lengths more evenly, resulting in fewer pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. Therefore, I think Investigator 2 would record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
