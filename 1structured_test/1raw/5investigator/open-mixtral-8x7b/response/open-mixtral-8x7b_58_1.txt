{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be concentrated in the technical or specific jargon used in the text. These words are more likely to occur in the first line of a page, where new chapters, sections, or concepts might start. In contrast, the average word-length for an entire page is more likely to be diluted by the presence of common words and phrases, which would lower the overall average word-length for the page.
