{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words are not evenly distributed across lines on a page, and the likelihood of having a higher average word-length in a line is greater than in an entire page. A few longer words in a line can significantly increase the average word-length in that line, while the same words spread over a full page would have a smaller impact on the overall page average. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to find more lines with a high average word-length than Investigator 1.
