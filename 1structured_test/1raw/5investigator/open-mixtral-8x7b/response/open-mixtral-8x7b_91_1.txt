I think Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. The reason is that by taking the first line in each page, Investigator 2 is more likely to capture exceptions or special cases where the author decided to use longer words in the beginning of a page, which could result in a higher count of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which may have a more balanced distribution of word lengths and therefore fewer pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
