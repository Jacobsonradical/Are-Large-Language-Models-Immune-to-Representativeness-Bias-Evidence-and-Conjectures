{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason for this is that by selecting the first line of each page, Investigator 2 is focusing on a specific portion of the page that may have a higher concentration of longer words. In contrast, Investigator 1 is considering the entire page, which would include a wider variety of word lengths and could potentially balance out any higher concentration of longer words in certain lines.

While it is possible that the number of pages with an average word-length of 6 or more is close to the number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, I believe that Investigator 2's approach is more likely to result in a higher count due to the specific portion of the page being analyzed.
