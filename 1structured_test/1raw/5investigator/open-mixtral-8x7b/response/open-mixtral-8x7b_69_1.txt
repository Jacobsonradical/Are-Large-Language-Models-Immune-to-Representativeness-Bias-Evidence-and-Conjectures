{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be longer and more complex words. Since Investigator 2 is looking at only the first line of each page, there is a higher chance that these longer words will appear in that line, as compared to the entire page (Investigator 1's approach). This is because a page may contain a mix of longer and shorter words, which would balance out the average word length when calculated for the entire page. However, the first line of a page is more likely to contain words that set the stage for the rest of the page, and thus may have a higher proportion of longer words. Therefore, Investigator 2 is likely to record a larger number of such units.
