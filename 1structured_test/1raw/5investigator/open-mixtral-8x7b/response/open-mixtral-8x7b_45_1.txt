{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words with many letters (and therefore likely to contribute to an average word-length of 6 or more) are often clustered together in sentences. Since Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, there is a higher chance that these clusters of longer words will be captured in at least one of the lines on a page. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length for an entire page, which may dilute the effect of these longer word clusters if they are spread out over multiple lines. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to find a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
