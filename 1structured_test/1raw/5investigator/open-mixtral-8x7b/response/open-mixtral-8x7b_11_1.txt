{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be longer, more complex words, which may not appear evenly distributed throughout the pages. They might be more concentrated in specific lines, such as the beginning of a new chapter, a quote, or a character's dialogue, which Investigator 2 would be more likely to capture by focusing on the first line of each page.

However, it is difficult to be certain without more information about the distribution and frequency of longer words in the text. Nonetheless, Investigator 2's method would likely result in a higher count compared to Investigator 1.
