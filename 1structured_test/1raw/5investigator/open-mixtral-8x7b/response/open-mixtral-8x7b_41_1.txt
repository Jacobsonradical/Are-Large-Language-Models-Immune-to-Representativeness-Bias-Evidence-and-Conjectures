{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would most likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line in each page might have a higher concentration of longer words compared to the rest of the page. Since Investigator 2 is only looking at the first line of each page, they may be more likely to find a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is looking at the entire page, which will include a mix of both longer and shorter words, possibly balancing out the average word-length for the entire page.
