{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be longer, more complex words, which might not appear on every page but are more likely to appear in a single line. In contrast, even if a page has an average word length of 6 or more, it could still have a significant number of shorter words, bringing the average down. Thus, Investigator 2 is more likely to find a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 with pages.
