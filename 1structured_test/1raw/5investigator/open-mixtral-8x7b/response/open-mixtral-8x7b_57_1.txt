{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines (with an average word-length of 6 or more) compared to Investigator 1 counting pages. This is because a single page can have a mix of shorter and longer words, causing the overall page average to be lower than the average of individual lines. By focusing on the first line of each page, Investigator 2 is more likely to capture lines with a higher concentration of longer words, leading to a larger count.
