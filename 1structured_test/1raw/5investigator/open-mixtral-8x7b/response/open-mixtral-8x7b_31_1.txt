{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more) compared to Investigator 1 (pages with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an above-average length are likely to be spread more evenly throughout the text, rather than consistently appearing on every page. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to find a greater number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
