{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because Investigator 2 is only considering the first line of each page, whereas Investigator 1 is considering the entire page. It is possible that the first line of many pages may have an average word-length of 6 or more, while the rest of the page does not. This would result in Investigator 2 recording a larger number of such lines compared to Investigator 1.
