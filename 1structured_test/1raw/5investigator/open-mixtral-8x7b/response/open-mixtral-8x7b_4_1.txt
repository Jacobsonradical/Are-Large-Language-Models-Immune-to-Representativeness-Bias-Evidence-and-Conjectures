{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of a page may contain shorter or longer words, which can cause the line's average word-length to differ significantly from the overall page average. Since the book's average word-length is 4, there are likely to be more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to the number of pages where the overall average word-length is 6 or more.
