{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be longer, more complex words, which might not appear on every page but could still appear in the first line of a page due to factors like page margins and indentations. Therefore, Investigator 2 might have a higher chance of encountering these longer words in their selected lines compared to Investigator 1, who is considering entire pages.
