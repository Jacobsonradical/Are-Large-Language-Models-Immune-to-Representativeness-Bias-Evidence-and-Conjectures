{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words are not evenly distributed across lines and pages, so the distribution of word lengths on a per-line basis would likely be different from that on a per-page basis.

Furthermore, consider a page where the average word length is 6 or more - it is possible that some lines on this page might have an average word length below 6, even if there are also lines with an average word length above 6. If those lines with lower average word length were selected, then Investigator 2's count would be higher than Investigator 1's for that page.

While this is not guaranteed for every page, the uneven distribution of words on lines and the possibility of selecting different lines between the investigators suggest that Investigator 2 would more likely record a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
