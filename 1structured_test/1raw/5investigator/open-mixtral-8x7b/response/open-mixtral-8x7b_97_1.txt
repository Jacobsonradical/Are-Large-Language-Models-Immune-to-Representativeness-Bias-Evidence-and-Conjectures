{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). The reason for my answer is that words with many letters are likely to be spread across lines rather than being confined to a single page. Thus, Investigator 2 is more likely to encounter lines with higher average word-lengths than Investigator 1. However, I do not have enough information to definitively say if the difference would be more than 5%.
