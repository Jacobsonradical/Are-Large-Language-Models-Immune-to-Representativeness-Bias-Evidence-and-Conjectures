{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines. The reason is that words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be longer than usual, and their impact on the average word length will be more noticeable in a single line than on an entire page. Thus, it is more probable that Investigator 2 will find more lines with an average word length of 6 or more than Investigator 1 will find pages with that average word length.
