{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line in each page might have a higher concentration of longer words compared to the average word-length for the entire page. This could result in Investigator 2 identifying more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. However, the difference may not be substantial and could potentially fall within 5% of each other.
