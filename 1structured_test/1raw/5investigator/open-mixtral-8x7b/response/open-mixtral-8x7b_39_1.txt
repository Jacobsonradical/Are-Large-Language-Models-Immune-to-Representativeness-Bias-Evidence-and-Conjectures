{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line of each page might have a higher concentration of longer words compared to the overall page average. This could cause Investigator 2's count to be higher, as they are focusing on individual lines rather than the entire page.

However, this is just an educated guess based on the information provided and the specific circumstances can vary depending on the actual content of the book.
