{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines. This is because the selection of lines throughout the book by Investigator 2 may be more likely to have a higher average word-length compared to the average word-length of an entire page (Investigator 1). This is because certain lines could have a higher concentration of longer words compared to other lines within the same page, even if the overall average word-length for that page is lower. Therefore, Investigator 2's approach of focusing on individual lines may result in a larger number of instances where the average word-length is 6 or more.
