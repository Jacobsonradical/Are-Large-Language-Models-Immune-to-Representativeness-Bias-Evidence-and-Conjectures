{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would most likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because by selecting the first line of each page, Investigator 2 is more likely to capture lines with longer words, especially if those lines are titles, headings, or contain complex vocabulary. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is considering an entire page, which will include many short words and is less likely to consistently have an average word-length of 6 or more. Therefore, Investigator 2 would likely have a higher count than Investigator 1.
