{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that by selecting only the first line of each page, Investigator 2 is potentially choosing lines that have shorter words, as these lines might not have as many long words as other lines on the same page. This bias towards lines with shorter words would result in Investigator 2 having fewer lines with an average word-length of 6 or more, making Investigator 1's count larger by comparison. However, I don't think the difference would be more than 5%.
