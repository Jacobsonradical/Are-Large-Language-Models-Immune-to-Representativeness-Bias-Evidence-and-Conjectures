{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines. This is because words at the end of a line or beginning of a new line might be longer, causing the average word-length of the first line on a page to be higher than the average word-length of the entire page. This effect would be more pronounced if there are many short words on a page, causing the overall page average to be low, but the first line average can still be high due to a few long words.
