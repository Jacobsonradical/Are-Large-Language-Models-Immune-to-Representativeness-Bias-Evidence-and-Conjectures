{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words with higher average word-lengths are likely to be spread more evenly throughout the text rather than consistently appearing on each page. Therefore, the probability of finding a line with an average word-length of 6 or more is higher than finding a whole page with that average word-length.

However, it's worth noting that this is a rough estimation and the actual difference in numbers may be less than 5%, depending on the specific text being analyzed.
