{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines because they are considering a smaller sample (one line per page) compared to Investigator 1 who is considering an entire page. This would make it more likely for Investigator 2 to find lines where the average word length is higher than the overall book average (4), even if the difference is small. As a result, Investigator 2 may record a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1.
