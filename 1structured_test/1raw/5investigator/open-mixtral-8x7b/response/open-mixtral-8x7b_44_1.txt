{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line on a page may not be representative of the entire page, and could more easily have a higher average word-length. The distribution of word lengths may vary significantly throughout the page, and the line selected at the beginning may just happen to contain longer words. Consequently, Investigator 2 may end up with a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1.
