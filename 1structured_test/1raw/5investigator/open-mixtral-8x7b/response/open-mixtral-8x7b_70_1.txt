{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be longer, more complex words. The distribution of these longer words is likely to be more evenly spread out across individual lines compared to entire pages. Thus, Investigator 2 is more likely to find a higher number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more.
