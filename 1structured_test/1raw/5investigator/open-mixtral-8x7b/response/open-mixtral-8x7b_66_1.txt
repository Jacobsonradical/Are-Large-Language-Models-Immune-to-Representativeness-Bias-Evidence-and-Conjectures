{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines because they're focusing on individual lines, which may have a higher concentration of longer words compared to an entire page. A single long word in a line can significantly impact its average word length, making it more likely to be 6 or more. In contrast, a page might have a more balanced distribution of longer and shorter words, leading to fewer pages with an average word length of 6 or more.
