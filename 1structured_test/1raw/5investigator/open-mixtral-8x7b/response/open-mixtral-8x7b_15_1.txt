{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more) compared to Investigator 1 (pages with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an above-average length are more likely to be spread out across a page rather than concentrated in a single line. Therefore, it is more probable that a line will have an average word-length of 6 or more than a whole page will.
