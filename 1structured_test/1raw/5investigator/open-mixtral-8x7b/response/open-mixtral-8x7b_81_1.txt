{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 will likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line in each page may have a higher concentration of longer words compared to the overall page average. This effect might make Investigator 2's count higher than Investigator 1's count for pages with an average word-length of 6 or more.
