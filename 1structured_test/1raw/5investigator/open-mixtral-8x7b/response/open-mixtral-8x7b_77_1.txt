{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). Since the overall average word-length in the entire book is 4, it is more probable that individual lines have a higher proportion of shorter words, which would result in fewer lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to pages. This is because the average word-length on a page is calculated using more words, making it more likely for the average to be closer to the overall average of 4.
