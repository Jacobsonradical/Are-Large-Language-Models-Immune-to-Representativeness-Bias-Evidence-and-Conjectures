{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would most likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the selection of lines is more localized and may therefore be more likely to have higher word-lengths, especially if there are certain pages or sections of the book where the vocabulary or sentence structure tends to be more complex. In contrast, Investigator 1 is averaging over an entire page, so it is more likely that the word-lengths will be closer to the overall book average of 4. Therefore, Investigator 1 may record fewer pages with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 2.
