{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). The reason is that words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be spread unevenly throughout the book, and concentrations of these longer words are more likely to appear in individual lines than in entire pages. Thus, Investigator 2's method of examining lines is more likely to capture these concentrations than Investigator 1's method of examining pages.
