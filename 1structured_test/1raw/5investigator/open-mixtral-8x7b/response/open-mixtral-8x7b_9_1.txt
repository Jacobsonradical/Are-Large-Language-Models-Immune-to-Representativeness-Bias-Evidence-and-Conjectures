{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be longer, more complex words. These types of words might be used less frequently than shorter words, but they can still appear within a single line of text, especially if the line is a quote or contains specialized terminology. In contrast, an entire page would need to have a concentration of these longer words to reach the 6-or-more average, making it less likely for Investigator 1 to record as many instances.
