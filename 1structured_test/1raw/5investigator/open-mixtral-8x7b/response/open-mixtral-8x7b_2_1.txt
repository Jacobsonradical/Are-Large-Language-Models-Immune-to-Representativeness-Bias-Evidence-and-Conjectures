{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because by selecting only the first line of each page, Investigator 2 is focusing on a smaller and potentially more variable sample compared to Investigator 1, who is looking at an entire page. This increased variability may result in a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
