{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would most likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. The reason is that by selecting only the first line of each page, Investigator 2 is focusing on a smaller sample size compared to Investigator 1, who is analyzing the entire page. This smaller sample size increases the likelihood that the average word-length in that line will be higher than the overall page average.

Furthermore, words at the beginning of a page may tend to be longer due to the way text is formatted or structured, with titles, headings, or longer phrases appearing at the start of a page. This could also contribute to Investigator 2 observing a higher number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
