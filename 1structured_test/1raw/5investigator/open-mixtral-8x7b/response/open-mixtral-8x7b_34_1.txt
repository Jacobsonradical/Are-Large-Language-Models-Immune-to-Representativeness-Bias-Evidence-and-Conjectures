{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would most likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words with higher average word-lengths are likely to be scattered throughout the text rather than evenly distributed across pages. Thus, taking the first line of each page would have a higher chance of capturing these longer words, leading to a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.

In contrast, Investigator 1 is looking at the average word-length for an entire page, which may not have enough longer words to push the average above 6 for a significant number of pages. Therefore, Investigator 2's results are more likely to yield a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more.
