{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because the distribution of word lengths on a line-by-line basis is likely to be more variable than the distribution of word lengths on a page-by-page basis. This increased variability means that there is a higher probability of encountering lines with an average word length of 6 or more compared to pages with the same average.

This effect would be particularly pronounced in a paperback with a consistent layout, where the number of words per line remains relatively constant throughout the book. In such a case, the average word length per line would be most directly influenced by the length of individual words, which is likely to be more variable than the overall average word length for a given page.

However, the difference may not be substantial, and a more detailed analysis would be required to determine whether the number of pages and lines with an average word length of 6 or more are within 5% of each other.
