{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with higher average word-lengths are likely to be more complex and less frequent. Since Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, they have a higher chance of encountering these less frequent, higher average word-length words, as compared to Investigator 1 who is looking at entire pages. This bias towards the beginning of the page would cause Investigator 2's numbers to be higher.
