{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line in each page might have a higher concentration of longer words compared to the rest of the page, especially if the page starts with a title or a subheading. By focusing on the first line of each page, Investigator 2 might be more likely to find a greater number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This effect might not be very large, but it could still result in Investigator 2 recording a larger number than Investigator 1.
