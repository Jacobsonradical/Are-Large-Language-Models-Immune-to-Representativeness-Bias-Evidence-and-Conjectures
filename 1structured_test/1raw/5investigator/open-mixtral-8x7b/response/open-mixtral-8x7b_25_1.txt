{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines because they are focusing on individual lines, which may have a higher concentration of longer words than entire pages. Since there are more opportunities to find lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to pages, Investigator 2 would likely have a higher count.
