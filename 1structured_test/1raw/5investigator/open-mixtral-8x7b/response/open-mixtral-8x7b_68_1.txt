{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). The reason for my answer is that when considering only the first line of each page, Investigator 2 might be more likely to capture lines with longer words, as the beginning of pages can sometimes include longer words like chapter titles, names, or technical terms. This effect might lead to Investigator 2 counting more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1, who is looking at an entire page containing a mix of various word lengths.
