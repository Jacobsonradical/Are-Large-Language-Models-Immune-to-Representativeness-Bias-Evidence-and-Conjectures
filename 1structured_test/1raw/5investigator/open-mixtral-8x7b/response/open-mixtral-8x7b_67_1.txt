{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be longer, more complex words, which may be less common than shorter words. By focusing on the first line of each page, Investigator 2 is more likely to capture these less common, longer words, resulting in a higher count.

In contrast, Investigator 1 is calculating the average word length for each page, which includes all the words on that page. This means that even if a page contains one or two long words, they will be averaged out with the shorter words, resulting in a lower overall average word length for that page.

Therefore, I believe that Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word length of 6 or more, as they are specifically targeting the areas of the text where these longer words are more likely to appear.
