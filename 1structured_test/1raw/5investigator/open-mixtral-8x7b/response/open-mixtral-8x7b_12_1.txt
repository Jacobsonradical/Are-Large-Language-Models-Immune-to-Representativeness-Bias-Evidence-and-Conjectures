{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be relatively long and less frequent compared to words with an average length of 4. Since Investigator 2 is looking at individual lines, the chances of encountering a line with a higher average word-length (due to a few long words) are higher compared to Investigator 1, who is looking at the average word-length for an entire page. Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
