{investigator: 2}

I think Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines. This is because the first line of a page may not be representative of the entire page's average word-length, especially if the page contains a mix of sentences with different word lengths. It is possible that there are more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than pages with an average word-length of 6 or more. However, the difference might not be significant and may be within 5% of each other.
