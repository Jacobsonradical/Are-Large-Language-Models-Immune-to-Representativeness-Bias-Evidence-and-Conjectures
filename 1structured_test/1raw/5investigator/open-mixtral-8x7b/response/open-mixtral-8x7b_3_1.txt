{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words with higher average word-lengths are likely to be more complex and less common, and thus more likely to be spread out unevenly across pages. This means that it is more probable for a single line to have an average word-length of 6 or more, compared to an entire page having an average word-length of 6 or more. Thus, Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of such lines.
