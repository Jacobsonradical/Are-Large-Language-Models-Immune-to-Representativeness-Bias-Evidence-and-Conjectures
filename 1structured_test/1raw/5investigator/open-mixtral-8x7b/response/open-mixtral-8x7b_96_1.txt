{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines. The reason is that words at the end of a line are often shorter to ensure the text fits neatly within the column width. Since Investigator 2 is looking at the first line of each page, they are more likely to encounter lines with lower average word-lengths compared to Investigator 1 who is looking at entire pages. This bias towards shorter words on the first line of each page would cause Investigator 2 to have a higher count of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
