{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines because the selection of lines is more likely to have a higher average word-length than the entire page. This is because the first line in each page may contain longer words or fewer words, which could increase the average word-length. Additionally, this effect is more pronounced as the number of pages increases, which would also contribute to Investigator 2 recording a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
