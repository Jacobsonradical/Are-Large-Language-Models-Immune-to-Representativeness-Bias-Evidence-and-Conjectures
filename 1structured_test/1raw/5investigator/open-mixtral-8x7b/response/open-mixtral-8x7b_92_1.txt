{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because they are looking at a smaller sample (one line per page) compared to Investigator 1 (all words on a page), making it more likely for them to find lines with higher average word-lengths.

This effect might be especially pronounced if the book has a structure where some pages are dedicated to having longer words or more complex sentences, while other pages have simpler language. Investigator 2's method would be more sensitive to such cases, since their sampling unit is smaller and less influenced by other words on the same page.

However, I cannot guarantee that this would hold true for every single book, and it would be interesting to see the actual results for a given paperback.
