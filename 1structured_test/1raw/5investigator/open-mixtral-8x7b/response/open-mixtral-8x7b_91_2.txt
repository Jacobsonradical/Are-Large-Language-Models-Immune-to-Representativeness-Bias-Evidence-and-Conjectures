{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would most likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the first line in each page might have a higher concentration of longer words compared to the whole page, which would include shorter words that balance out the average word-length. Thus, the first line in each page might more frequently have an average word-length of 6 or more than the whole page.
