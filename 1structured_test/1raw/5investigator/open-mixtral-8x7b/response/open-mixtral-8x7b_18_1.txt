{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would most likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because words with higher average word-lengths are naturally less frequent, and by selecting only the first line of each page, Investigator 2 has a higher chance of encountering lines with lower word-counts, making it easier to exceed the threshold of 6. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is considering the entire page, which is more likely to have a balanced mix of words with different lengths.
