{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the selection of lines is likely more variable than the selection of pages, especially if the lines at the beginning or end of pages have a higher concentration of long words. While some pages will have a higher average word-length, it is less likely to be as consistently high as what Investigator 2 might observe. Of course, the actual difference would depend on the specific book and its distribution of word lengths.
