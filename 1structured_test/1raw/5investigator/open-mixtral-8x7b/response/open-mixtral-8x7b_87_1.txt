{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 is likely to have recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with higher average word-lengths are likely to be spread more evenly throughout the text, and Investigator 2 is considering a smaller sample (one line per page) compared to Investigator 1 (all the words on a page), which may increase the probability of hitting on those higher-average lines.
