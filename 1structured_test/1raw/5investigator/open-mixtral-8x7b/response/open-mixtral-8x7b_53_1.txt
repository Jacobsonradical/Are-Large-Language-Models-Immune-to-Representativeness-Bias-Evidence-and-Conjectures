{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units. The reason is that focusing on individual lines (selected as the first line in each page) gives a higher probability of encountering lines with an above-average word-length, in this case, 6 or more. This is because word distribution is not uniform across lines within a page, and the first line could have a higher concentration of longer words. On the other hand, Investigator 1 is considering the average word-length for an entire page, which is likely to be more stable and closer to the overall book average of 4.
