{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because the selection of lines is a smaller sample compared to whole pages. By focusing on lines, Investigator 2 has a higher probability of finding shorter sections with a higher average word-length since words are distributed randomly within a line. On the other hand, Investigator 1 needs to deal with a larger sample in each page, which would include more variation, making it less likely to have a higher average word-length across the entire page.
