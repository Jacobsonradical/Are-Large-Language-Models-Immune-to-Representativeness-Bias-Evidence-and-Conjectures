{investigator: 2}

I believe that Investigator 2 would likely record a larger number of such lines with an average word-length of 6 or more. This is because by taking the first line in each page, Investigator 2 is more likely to capture lines with higher word-length averages due to the presence of longer words or proper nouns, which can significantly impact the average word-length of a single line.

In contrast, Investigator 1 calculates the average word-length for an entire page, which would likely result in a more balanced and consistent average word-length, even if some individual lines within the page have a higher or lower average word-length.

Therefore, Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more.
