Without having the actual data from the study, it's impossible to give a definitive answer. However, I would guess that Investigator 2 probably recorded a larger number of such lines. This is because the first line of a page may not be representative of the entire page, and it's possible that there are more lines with an average word-length of 6 or more than there are pages with that average. Therefore, my answer is:

{investigator: 2}

However, I emphasize that this is just a guess, and the actual numbers could be different depending on the specific properties of the paperback chosen for the study.
