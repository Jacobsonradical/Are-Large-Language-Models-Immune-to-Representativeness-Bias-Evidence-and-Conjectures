{investigator: 2}

I believe Investigator 2 recorded a larger number of such units (lines with an average word-length of 6 or more). This is because words with an average length of 6 or more are likely to be relatively long and less common in the English language compared to shorter words. Therefore, the chances of finding such long words concentrated in a single line are higher than finding them spread out over an entire page. As a result, Investigator 2 is more likely to find a greater number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 who is counting pages.
