Investigator: 2

Justification: 

Investigator 2 is more likely to record a larger number of lines with an average word-length of 6 or more compared to Investigator 1 counting pages. This is because words with above-average lengths will have a greater impact on the average word-length of a line than on a whole page. Therefore, it is more likely for a line to have an average word-length of 6 or more, even if the overall book's average word-length is 4. This effect will be even more pronounced in books with a higher degree of variation in word lengths or sentence structures throughout the text.
