{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is **independent**. This means a husband's dreaming status doesn't influence his wife's dreaming status.
* We know 20% of people are Nondreamers.
* Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and his wife's dreaming status is independent, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
