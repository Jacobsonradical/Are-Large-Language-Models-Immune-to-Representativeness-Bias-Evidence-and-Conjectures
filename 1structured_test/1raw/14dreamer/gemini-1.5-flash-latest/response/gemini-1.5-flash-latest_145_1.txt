{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no influence on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
