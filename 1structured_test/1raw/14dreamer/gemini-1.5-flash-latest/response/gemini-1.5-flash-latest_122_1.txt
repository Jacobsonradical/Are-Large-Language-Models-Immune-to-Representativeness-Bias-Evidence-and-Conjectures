{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that whether Brett dreams or not has no impact on whether his wife dreams or not.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is **0.2**.
