{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is **independent**. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
*  The problem tells us 20% of people are Nondreamers. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%).
