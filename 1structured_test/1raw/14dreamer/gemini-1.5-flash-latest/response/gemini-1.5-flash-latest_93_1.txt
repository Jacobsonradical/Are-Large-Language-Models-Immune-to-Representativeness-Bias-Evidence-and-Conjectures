{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't give us any information about whether his wife is also a Nondreamer. 

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
