Here's how to solve this:

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is **independent**.  This means that whether Brett dreams or not has no impact on whether his wife dreams. 

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 20%.

**{probability: 0.2}**
