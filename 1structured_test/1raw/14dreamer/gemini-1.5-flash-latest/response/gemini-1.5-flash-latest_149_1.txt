{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer provides no information about his wife's dreaming habits.

Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
