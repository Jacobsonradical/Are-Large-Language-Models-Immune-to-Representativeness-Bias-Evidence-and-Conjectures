Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Independence:** The problem states that the dream classification of a husband and wife is independent. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
* **Overall Probability:** We know that 20% of people are Nondreamers.

**Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%).**

**{probability: 0.20}**
