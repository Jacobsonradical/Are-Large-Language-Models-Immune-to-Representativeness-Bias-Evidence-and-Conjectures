Here's how to solve this:

* **The problem states that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.**  This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
* **We know 20% of people are Nondreamers.**

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is **0.20**.

**{probability: 0.20}**
