Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that whether Brett dreams or not has no influence on whether his wife dreams.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population percentage: 20% or 0.2.
