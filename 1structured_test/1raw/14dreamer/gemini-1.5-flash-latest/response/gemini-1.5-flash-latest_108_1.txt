Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is also a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
