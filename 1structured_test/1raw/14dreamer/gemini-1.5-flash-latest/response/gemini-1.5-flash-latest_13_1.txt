Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Independence:** The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
* **Overall Probability:** We know 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

**Therefore:**

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is still **20%**.

**{probability: 0.2}**
