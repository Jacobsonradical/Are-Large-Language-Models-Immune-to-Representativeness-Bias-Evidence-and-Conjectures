{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
