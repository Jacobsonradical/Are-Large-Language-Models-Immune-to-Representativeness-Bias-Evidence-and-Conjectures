{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer provides no information about the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is **0.2**.
