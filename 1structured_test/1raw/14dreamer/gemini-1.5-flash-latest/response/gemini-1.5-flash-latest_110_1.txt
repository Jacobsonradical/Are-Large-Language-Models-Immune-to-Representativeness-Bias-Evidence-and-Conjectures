{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is **independent**. 
* This means that Brett being a Nondreamer has **no impact** on the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer.
* The overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer is 20%, regardless of their relationship status.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
