The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't give us any information about his wife's dreaming habits.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
