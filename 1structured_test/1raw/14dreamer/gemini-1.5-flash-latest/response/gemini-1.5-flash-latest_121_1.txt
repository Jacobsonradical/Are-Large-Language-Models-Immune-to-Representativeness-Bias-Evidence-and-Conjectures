{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
