{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is **independent**. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Nondreamer.
* We know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. 
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is **0.2**.
