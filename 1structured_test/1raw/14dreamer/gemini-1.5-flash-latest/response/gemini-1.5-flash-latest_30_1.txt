{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is **independent**. This means a husband's dreaming habits don't influence his wife's dreaming habits.
* We know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
* Since Brett's wife's dreaming status is independent of his, the probability that she is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
