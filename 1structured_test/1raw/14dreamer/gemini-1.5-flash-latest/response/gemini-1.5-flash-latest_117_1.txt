Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Independence:** The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer gives us no information about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.
* **Overall Probability:** We know 20% of people are Nondreamers.

**Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.**

**{probability: 0.20}**
