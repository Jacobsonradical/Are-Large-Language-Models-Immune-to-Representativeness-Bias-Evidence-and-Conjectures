{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* **Independence:** The statement "With respect to dreaming, the classification of husband and wife was found to be independent" is crucial. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
* **Base Rate:** The base rate for Nondreamers is 20% (given in the problem). 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the base rate for Nondreamers, which is 0.2.
