Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Independence:** The problem states that a husband's dreaming classification is independent of his wife's. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
* **Overall Probability:** We know 20% of people are Nondreamers. 

**Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.**

**{probability: 0.20}**
