{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. 
* This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
* We know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. 
* Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is 0.2.
