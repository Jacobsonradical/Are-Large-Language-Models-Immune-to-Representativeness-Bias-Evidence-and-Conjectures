{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* **Independence:** The statement "With respect to dreaming, the classification of husband and wife was found to be independent" is crucial. This means a husband's dreaming status has no influence on his wife's dreaming status.
* **Nondreamer Probability:** We are told that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* **Combined Probability:** Since the dreaming status is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
