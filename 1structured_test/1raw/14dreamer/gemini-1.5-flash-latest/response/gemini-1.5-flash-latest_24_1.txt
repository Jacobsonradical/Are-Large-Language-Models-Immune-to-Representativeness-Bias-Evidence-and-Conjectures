{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that Brett's dreaming status doesn't influence his wife's dreaming status.
* We are told that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. 
* Since Brett's wife's dreaming status is independent of his, the probability that she is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
