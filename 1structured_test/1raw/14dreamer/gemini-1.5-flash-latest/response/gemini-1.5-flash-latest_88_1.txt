{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't give us any information about his wife's dreaming habits.
*  We are told 20% of people are Nondreamers.  
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability: 20% or 0.2.
