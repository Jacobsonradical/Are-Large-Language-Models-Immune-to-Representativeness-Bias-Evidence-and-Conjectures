The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that Brett being a Nondreamer doesn't influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
