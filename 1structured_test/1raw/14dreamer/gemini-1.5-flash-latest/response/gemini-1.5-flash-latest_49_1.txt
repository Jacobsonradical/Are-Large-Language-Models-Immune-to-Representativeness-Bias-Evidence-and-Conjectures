{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* **Independence:** The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that Brett's dreaming status has no influence on his wife's dreaming status.
* **Nondreamer Probability:** The problem states that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
* **Therefore:**  The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
