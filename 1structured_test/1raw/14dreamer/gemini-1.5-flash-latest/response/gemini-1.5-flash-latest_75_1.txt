{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is **independent**. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
* We are told that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is still **20% or 0.2**.
