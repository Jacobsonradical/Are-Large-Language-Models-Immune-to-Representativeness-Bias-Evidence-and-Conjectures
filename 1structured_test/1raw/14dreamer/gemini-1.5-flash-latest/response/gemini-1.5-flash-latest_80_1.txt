The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
