Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.  This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer gives us no information about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 20% or 0.2.
