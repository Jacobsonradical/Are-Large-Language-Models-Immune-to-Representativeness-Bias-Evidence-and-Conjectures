{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. 
* This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
* We are told that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
