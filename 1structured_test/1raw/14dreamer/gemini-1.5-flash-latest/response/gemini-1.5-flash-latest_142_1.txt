{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that whether Brett dreams or not has no influence on whether his wife dreams.
* We know that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Since the classifications are independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
