{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is **independent**. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
* We're told that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is **0.2**.
