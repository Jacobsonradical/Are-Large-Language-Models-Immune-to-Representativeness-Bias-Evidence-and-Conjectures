{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that Brett's dreaming habits have no impact on his wife's dreaming habits.
* We know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
* Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
