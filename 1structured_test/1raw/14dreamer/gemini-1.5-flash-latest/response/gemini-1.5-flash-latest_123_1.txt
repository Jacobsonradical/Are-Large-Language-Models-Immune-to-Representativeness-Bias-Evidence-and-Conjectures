{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

* The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
* We are told 20% of people are Nondreamers. 
* Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population, which is 20%, or 0.2.
