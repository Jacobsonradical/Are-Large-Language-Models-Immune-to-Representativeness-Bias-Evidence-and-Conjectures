Here's why:

The statement says that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
