{probability: 0.04} 

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.04 or 4%. This is because if the classifications of dreamers and nondreamers are independent between spouses, then the probability of both spouses being nondreamers would be 0.2 (20% of the population are nondreamers) multiplied by 0.2, which equals 0.04 or 4%.
