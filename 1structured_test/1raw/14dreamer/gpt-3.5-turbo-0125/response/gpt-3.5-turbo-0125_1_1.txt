{probability: 0.04} 

Since husband and wife are classified independently as Dreamers or Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is 20% (0.2). Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer would be 20% of that, which is 20% of 20% or 4% (0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04).
