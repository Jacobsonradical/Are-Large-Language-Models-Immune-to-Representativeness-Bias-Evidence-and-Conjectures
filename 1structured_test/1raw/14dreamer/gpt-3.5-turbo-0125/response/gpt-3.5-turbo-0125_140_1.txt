{probability: 0.04} 

Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming was found to be independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%. This can be calculated as follows: 20% of the population are Nondreamers, so 20% of wives of Dreamers are Nondreamers and 20% of wives of Nondreamers are Nondreamers. The probability, therefore, is 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04, or 4%.
