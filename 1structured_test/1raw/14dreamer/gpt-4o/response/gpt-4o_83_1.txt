The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

According to the given information, 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, which means the probability of any person being a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
