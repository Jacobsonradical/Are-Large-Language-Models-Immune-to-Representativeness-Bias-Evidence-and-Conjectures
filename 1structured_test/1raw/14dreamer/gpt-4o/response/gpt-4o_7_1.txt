Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the same as the base probability for any individual being a Nondreamer.

The base probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
