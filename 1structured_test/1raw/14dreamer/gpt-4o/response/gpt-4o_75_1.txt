Since the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer. 

Given the information:
- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
