Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.
