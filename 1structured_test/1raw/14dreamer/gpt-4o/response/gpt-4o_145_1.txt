Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, we can use the probabilities provided to calculate the likelihood that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

- The probability of any given person being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer.

So, the probability is:
{probability: 0.20}
