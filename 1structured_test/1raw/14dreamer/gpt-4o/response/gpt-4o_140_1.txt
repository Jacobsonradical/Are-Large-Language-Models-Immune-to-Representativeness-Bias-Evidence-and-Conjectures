Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

We know:
- The probability that any individual is a Nondreamer is 20%, which can be written as 0.20.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
