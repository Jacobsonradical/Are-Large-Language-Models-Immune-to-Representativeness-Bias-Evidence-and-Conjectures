Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any person is a Nondreamer.

The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
