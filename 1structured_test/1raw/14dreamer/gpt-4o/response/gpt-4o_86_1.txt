Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would be the same as the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
