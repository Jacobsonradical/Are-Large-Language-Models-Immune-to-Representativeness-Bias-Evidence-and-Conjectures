Given that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer would be the same as the general probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

According to the information provided, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20, or 20%.
