Given that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer. We are told that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.
