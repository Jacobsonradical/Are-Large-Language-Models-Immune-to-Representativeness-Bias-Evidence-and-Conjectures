Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability that any person is a Nondreamer.

From the information provided, the probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
