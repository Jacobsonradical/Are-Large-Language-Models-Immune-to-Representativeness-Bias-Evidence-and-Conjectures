Given the information that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, we can calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer using the provided data.

The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, meaning the probability of one being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of the other being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the overall probability that any person is a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.20}

So, there is a 20% chance that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.
