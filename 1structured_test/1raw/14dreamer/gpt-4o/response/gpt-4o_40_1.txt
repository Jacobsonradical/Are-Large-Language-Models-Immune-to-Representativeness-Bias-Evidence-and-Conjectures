Given that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, we can determine the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer using the provided percentage.

The probability that any given person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Since the events are independent:
- Probability that Brett is a Nondreamer = 0.20
- Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, independent of Brett's classification = 0.20

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
