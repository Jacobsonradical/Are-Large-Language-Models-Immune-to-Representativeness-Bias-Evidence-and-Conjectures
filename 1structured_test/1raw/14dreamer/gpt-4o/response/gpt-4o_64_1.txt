Given the information that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, we can calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer. Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability remains the same for Brett's wife regardless of Brett's classification.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20 in decimal form.

{probability: 0.20}
