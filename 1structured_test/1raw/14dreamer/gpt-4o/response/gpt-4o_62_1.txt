Given that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, we can use the given probabilities directly.

The probability that any individual is a Nondreamer is 20%, which is equivalent to 0.20.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, what we are interested in is the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer, which remains 0.20 due to the independence of their dreaming classifications.
