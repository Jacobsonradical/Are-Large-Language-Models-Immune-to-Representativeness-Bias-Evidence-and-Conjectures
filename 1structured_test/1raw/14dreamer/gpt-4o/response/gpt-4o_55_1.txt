Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that someone is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer will be the same probability that any person is a Nondreamer, which is independent of Brett's status.

So the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
