Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, this means the probability of one spouse being a Dreamer or Nondreamer does not affect the probability of the other spouse being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

According to the given data, the probability that any given person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any given person being a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.2}
