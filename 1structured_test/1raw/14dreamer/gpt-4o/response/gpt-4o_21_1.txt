We need to determine the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer. According to the given data, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Additionally, the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is said to be independent.

Since the dreaming behavior is independent between husband and wife, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.

Hence, the probability can be expressed as:

{probability: 0.20}
