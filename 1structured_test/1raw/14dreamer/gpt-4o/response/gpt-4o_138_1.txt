Given the information that the classification of dreaming between husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the provided percentage of Nondreamers in the population.

The chance that any person is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer remains 20% or 0.20 due to the independence assumption.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
