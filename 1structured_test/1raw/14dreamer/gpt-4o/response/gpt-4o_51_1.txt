Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.

From the given data:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer would be:

{probability: 0.20}
