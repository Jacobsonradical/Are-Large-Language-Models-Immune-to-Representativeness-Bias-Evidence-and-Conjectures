Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is found to be independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer will be the same as the general probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

We are told that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
