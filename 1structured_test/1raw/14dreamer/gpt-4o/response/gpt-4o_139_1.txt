Given the problem details, we know that the probability \( P(\text{Nondreamer}) \) = 0.2 for any individual. The classification of husband and wife is independent. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
