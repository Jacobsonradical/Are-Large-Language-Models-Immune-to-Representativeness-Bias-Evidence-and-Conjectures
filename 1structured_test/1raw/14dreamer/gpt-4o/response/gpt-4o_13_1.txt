Based on the given information, we know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Given that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
