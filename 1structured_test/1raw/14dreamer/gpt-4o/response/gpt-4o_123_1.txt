Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability that any given individual is a Nondreamer.

From the information provided:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
