Given that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

From the information provided:

- The probability that any person is a Nondreamer = 20% or 0.20

Therefore,
{probability: 0.20}
