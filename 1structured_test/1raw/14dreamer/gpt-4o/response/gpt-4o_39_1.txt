Given that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

From the information provided, we know that:

- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore:

{probability: 0.20}
