Given that the classification of dreaming for husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer should be the same as the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer. According to the study, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
