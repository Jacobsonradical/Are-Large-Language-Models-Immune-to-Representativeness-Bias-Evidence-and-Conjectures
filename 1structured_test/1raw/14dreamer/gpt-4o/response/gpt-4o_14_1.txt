Given the information:

- 80% of people ("Dreamers") report that they dream.
- 20% of people ("Nondreamers") claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- Dream classification of husband and wife is independent.

Since the husband, Brett, is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer simply reflects the overall probability that any person is a Nondreamer, due to the independence of classifications.

Accordingly, the probability remains 20%.

Thus, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
