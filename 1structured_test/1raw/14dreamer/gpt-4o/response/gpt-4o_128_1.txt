To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can utilize the information that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. Given that the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2, we can calculate the probability for Brett's wife independently of his status.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
