Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer does not depend on Brett being a Nondreamer. Hence, the probability should simply be the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
