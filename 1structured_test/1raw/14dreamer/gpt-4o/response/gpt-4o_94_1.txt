Given the information provided that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, and the classification of husband and wife is independent, we can calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that any individual person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer does not change because Brett is a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
