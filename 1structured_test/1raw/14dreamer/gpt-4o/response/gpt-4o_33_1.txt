Given that the classifications of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers are independent, we can calculate the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer using the given proportions.

The probability that any given person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer remains the same as for any other individual.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
