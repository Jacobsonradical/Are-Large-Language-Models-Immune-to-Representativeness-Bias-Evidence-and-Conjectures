Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we want to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. According to the information provided, the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.

The probability that any given person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore:
{probability: 0.2}
