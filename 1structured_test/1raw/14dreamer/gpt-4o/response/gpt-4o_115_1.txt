Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated based on the independence of the dreaming classification between husband and wife.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

Based on the studies mentioned, 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
