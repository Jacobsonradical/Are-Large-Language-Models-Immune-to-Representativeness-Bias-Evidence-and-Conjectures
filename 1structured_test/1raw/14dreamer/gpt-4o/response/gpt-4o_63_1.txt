Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of any person being a Nondreamer.

The probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
