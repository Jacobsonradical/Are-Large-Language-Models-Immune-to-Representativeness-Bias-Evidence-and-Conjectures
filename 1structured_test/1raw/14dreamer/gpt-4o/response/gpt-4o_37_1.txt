Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, we can determine the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer independently of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

The probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
