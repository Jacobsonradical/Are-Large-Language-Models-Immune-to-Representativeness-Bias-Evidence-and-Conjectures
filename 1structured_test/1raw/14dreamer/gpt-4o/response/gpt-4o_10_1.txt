Given the information that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer. According to the given data, 20% of people are Nondreamers.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is \(0.20\).
