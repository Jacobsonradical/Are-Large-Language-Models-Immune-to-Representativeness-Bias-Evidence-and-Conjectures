Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer. Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.
