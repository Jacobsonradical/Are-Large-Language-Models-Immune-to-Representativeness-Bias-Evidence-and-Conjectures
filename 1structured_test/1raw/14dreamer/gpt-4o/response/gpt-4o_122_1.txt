Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated based on the independent probabilities.

The probability of any given person being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Since their classifications are independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
