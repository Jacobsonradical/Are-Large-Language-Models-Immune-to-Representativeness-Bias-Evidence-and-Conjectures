To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information:

1. 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
2. The classifications of husband and wife with respect to dreaming are independent.

Since the classification of Brett's wife as a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, in the specified format:

{probability: 0.20}
