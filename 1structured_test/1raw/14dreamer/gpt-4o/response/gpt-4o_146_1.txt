Given the information provided, the probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20. Since the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, the husband's classification does not affect the wife's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any random individual is a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.20}
