Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we want to determine the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. The problem states that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

We know that 20% of people are Nondreamers. Since the events are independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any person, in general, is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
