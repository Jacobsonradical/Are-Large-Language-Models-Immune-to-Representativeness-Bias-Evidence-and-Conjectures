Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer has no influence on the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability for any individual.

From the information provided:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
