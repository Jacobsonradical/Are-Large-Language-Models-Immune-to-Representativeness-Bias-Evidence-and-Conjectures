Given the independence of the dreaming classification between husband and wife, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be represented as:

{probability: 0.20}
