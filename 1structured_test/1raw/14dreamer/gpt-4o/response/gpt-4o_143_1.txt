To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we use the fact that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. 

The probability that any individual is a Nondreamer is given as 20% or 0.20.

Since the classifications are independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer:

{probability: 0.20}
