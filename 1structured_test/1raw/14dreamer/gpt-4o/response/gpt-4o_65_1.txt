Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any random person is a Nondreamer. According to the given information, 20% of people are Nondreamers.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

\[ P(\text{Wife is Nondreamer}) = 0.20 \]

Therefore:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.20} \} \]
