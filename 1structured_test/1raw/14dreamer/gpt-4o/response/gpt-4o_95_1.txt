Based on the information given, the probability that an individual is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2. Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is found to be independent, Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability for any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.

So the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
