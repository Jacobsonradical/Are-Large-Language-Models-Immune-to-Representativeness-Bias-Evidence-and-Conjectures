Given the provided information, we know:

- 80% of people are classified as Dreamers.
- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer depends solely on the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, because their classifications are independent.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is therefore the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20%, or 0.2.

So the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
