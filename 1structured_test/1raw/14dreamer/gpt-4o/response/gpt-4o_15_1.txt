Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is found to be independent, we can use the marginal probability for a wife to be a Nondreamer to find the answer. 

We know:
- The probability that an individual (regardless of gender) is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the marginal probability for any individual to be a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
