To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we use the given information and the concept of independence.

Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

From the information given, 20% of people are Nondreamers.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore,

{probability: 0.20}
