Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated directly from the given probabilities.

The probability that any given person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.20.

So, the probability can be stated as:

{probability: 0.20}
