Given that the classification of husband and wife regarding dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer remains the same as the general probability of someone being a Nondreamer.

We know from the information provided that 20% of the population are Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
