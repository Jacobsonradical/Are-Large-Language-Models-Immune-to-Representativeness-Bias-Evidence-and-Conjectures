Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is found to be independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

The probability of an individual being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
