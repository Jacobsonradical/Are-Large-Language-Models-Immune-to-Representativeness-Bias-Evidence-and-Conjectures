Given that the classification of dreaming is independent for husbands and wives, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability that any person is a Nondreamer.

From the information provided, 20% of people are Nondreamers. 

Hence, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
