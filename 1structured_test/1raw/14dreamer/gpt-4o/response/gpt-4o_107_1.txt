Given the information:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is found to be independent.

Thus, the probability that a wife is a Nondreamer is independent of whether her husband is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer. 

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability for any person, which is 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
