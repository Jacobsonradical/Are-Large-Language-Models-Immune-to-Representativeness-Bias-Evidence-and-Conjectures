Given the information, we know that the probabilities of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer for both sexes are the same and are independent of each other. 

- Probability that a person is a Dreamer: \( P(D) = 0.80 \)
- Probability that a person is a Nondreamer: \( P(N) = 0.20 \)

Since Brett is a Nondreamer (\( P(N) = 0.20 \)), and the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer remains the same as the general probability for any person being a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
