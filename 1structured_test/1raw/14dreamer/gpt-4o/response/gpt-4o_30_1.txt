Given that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer. 

As stated, 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
