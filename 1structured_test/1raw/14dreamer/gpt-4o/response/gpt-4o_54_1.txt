Given that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the prevalence of Nondreamers in the population. 

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 20%, or 0.2.
