The probability that someone is a Nondreamer is 20%, which is 0.20. Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
