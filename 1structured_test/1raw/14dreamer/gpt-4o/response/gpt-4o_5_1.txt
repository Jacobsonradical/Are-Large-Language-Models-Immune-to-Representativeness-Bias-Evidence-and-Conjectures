Given that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, we can treat the probability of each spouse falling into either category as independent events.

The probability that any given individual is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is: 
{probability: 0.20}
