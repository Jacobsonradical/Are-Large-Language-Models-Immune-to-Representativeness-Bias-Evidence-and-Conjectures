Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of the general population that are Nondreamers.

From the given information, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%).
