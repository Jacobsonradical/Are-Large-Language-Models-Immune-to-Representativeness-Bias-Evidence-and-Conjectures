Given the information that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, we can use the provided probabilities directly.

The probability that any given person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
