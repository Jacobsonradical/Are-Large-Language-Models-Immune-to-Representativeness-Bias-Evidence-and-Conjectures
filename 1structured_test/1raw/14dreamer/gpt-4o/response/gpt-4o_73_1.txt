Given that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of any person being a Nondreamer.

Since it is given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
