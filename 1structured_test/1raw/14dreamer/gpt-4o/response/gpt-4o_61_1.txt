Given that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any randomly selected individual is a Nondreamer.

From the information provided:
- The probability that a person is a Nondreamer = 20% = 0.2.

Since the classification is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

So, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
