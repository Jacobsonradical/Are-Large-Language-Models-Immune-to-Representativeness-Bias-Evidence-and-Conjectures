Let's denote the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer as \( P(N) \).

Given that:

- 20% of people are Nondreamers, so \( P(N) = 0.20 \).
- 80% of people are Dreamers, so \( P(D) = 0.80 \).
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we are interested in the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. Because of the independence of the classification between husband and wife, this probability is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

\{probability: 0.20\}
