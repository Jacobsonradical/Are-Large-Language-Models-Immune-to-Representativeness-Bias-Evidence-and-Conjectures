Given that dreaming status is independent between husband and wife, we simply use the proportion of the population that are Nondreamers to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

According to the information provided, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
