Given that husbands and wives are classified independently with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would be the same as the general probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

The problem states that 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
