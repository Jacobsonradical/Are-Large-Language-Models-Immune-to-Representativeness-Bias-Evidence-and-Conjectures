Given that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer. 

From the information provided, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
