Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent:

- Probability that any person is a Dreamer (D) = 0.80
- Probability that any person is a Nondreamer (ND) = 0.20

Since Brett is a Nondreamer (ND), the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer (ND) remains the same due to the independence of their classifications.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer (ND) is:

{probability: 0.20}
