Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected individual is a Nondreamer.

According to the given data:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
