Given that the classification of husbands and wives with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any randomly chosen individual is a Nondreamer.

We know from the information provided that 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2.
