Given that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent:

The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Since these classifications are independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore:

{probability: 0.2}
