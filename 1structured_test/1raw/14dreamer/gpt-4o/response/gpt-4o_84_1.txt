Given the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" for both sexes is independent, and knowing the base rates, we can calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

Since the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be directly taken as this base rate because it is given that these events are independent.

{probability: 0.20}
