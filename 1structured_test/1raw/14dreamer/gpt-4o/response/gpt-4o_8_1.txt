Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that a wife is a Nondreamer is not influenced by whether her husband is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

According to the information provided, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Hence, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

So the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
