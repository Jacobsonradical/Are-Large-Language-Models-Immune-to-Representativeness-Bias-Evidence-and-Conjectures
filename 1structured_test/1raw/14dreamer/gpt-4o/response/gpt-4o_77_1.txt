Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer doesn't affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. The probability of any individual being a Nondreamer is given as 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
