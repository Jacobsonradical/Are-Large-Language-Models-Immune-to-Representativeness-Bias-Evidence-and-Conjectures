We are given that people are classified into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" independent of their spouse. The probabilities of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer are:
- Probability of being a Dreamer (P(Dreamer)) = 0.8
- Probability of being a Nondreamer (P(Nondreamer)) = 0.2

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer, due to the independence assumption.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
