To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to consider the independence of the husband and wife's dreaming classifications. According to the information provided, the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not affect the classification of his wife.

The probability that any given individual is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
