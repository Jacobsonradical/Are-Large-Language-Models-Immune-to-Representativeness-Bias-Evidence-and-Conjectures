Given the information that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of any person being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
