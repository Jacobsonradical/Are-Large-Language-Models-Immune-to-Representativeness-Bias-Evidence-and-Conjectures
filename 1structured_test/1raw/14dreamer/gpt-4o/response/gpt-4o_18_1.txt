Since the classification of dreaming status between husbands and wives was found to be independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of a person being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.
