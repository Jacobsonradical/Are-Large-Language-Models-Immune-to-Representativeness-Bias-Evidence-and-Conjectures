Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer does not depend on Brett being a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

\[
\text{{probability}} = 0.20
\]

So, the answer is:
\[
\{\text{{probability}} : 0.20\}
\]
