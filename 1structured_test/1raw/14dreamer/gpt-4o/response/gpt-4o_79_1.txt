Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any random person is a Nondreamer.

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is thus 20% (which can be expressed as 0.20).

Therefore, the answer would be:
{probability: 0.20}
