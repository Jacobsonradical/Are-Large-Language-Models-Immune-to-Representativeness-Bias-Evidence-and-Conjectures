Given the information that the husband and wife are classified independently with respect to dreaming, we can use the given percentages to find the probability.

It is given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is also a Nondreamer is the same for any individual, regardless of the dreaming status of Brett.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
