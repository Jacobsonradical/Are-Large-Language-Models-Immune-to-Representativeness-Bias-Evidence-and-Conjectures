Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected individual is a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability is:
{probability: 0.20}
