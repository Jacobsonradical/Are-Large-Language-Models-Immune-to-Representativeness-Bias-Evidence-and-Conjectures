Given that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, we use the provided population statistics to determine the probabilities. 

The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer remains 0.20.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
