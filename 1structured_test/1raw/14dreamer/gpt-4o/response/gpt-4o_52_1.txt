Given the information that Brett is a Nondreamer and the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be determined as follows:

1. The probability that any person is a Nondreamer is given as 20%, or 0.20.

Since the classification is independent, the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
