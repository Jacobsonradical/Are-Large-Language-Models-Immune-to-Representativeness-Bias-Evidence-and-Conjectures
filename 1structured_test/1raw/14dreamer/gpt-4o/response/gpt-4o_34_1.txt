Given that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

From the information provided, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
