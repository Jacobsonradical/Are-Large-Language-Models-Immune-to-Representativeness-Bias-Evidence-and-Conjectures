To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information. We know:

- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Given Brett's classification as a Nondreamer, this does not influence the classification of his wife because their statuses are independent.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any random person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
