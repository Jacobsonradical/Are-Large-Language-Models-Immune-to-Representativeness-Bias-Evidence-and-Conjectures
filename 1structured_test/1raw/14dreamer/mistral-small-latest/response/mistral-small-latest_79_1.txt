The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming was found to be independent. This means that the husband's status as a dreamer or nondreamer does not affect the wife's status. So, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability is:
{probability: 0.2}
