Based on the information provided, the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is found to be independent. This means that the husband being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of the wife being a Nondreamer. If 20% of people are Nondreamers, then the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

So, your answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
