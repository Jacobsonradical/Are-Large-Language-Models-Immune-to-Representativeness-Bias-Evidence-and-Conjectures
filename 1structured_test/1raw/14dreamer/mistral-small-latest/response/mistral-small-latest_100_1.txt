probability: 0.2

Explanation: The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is found to be independent. This means that the probability of Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
