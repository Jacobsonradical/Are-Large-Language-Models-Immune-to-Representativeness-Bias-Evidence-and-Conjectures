The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is found to be independent. This means that the husband's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the wife's status as a Dreamer or Nondreamer. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same, which is 0.2.
