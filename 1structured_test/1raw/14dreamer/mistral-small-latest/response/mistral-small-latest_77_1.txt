probability: 0.2

The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers was found to be independent. This means that whether one person dreams or not does not affect the probability that the other person also dreams or not. In the given data, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
