Probability: 0.2

The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, meaning the probability of one being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of the other being a Nondreamer. Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
