probability: 0.2

Given that studies have shown the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, we can assume that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not influence his wife's status. Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
