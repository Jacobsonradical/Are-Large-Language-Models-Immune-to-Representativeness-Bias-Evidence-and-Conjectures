Probability: 0.2

Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is found to be independent, the wife's classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" does not depend on the husband's classification. Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
