Based on the information provided, the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is found to be independent. This means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability would be the same for Brett's wife.

So, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
