{probability: 0.2, assuming the classification of dreaming status is independent between spouses}

Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent, we can use the given probability for Nondreamers (20%) to determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability is 0.2 or 20%.
