{probability: 0.2,
The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect whether his wife is a Nondreamer. According to the problem, 20% of people do not remember ever dreaming, so the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.}
