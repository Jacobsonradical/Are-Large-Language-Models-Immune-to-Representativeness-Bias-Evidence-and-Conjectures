{probability: 0.2, the problem states that the classification of husband and wife is independent, meaning that one person being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of the other person being a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, there is a 0.2 probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.}
