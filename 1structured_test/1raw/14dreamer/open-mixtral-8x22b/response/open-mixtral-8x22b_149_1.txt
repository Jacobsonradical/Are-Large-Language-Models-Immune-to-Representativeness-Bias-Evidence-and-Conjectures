{probability: 0.2,

Explanation:
The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, meaning the probability of a wife being a Nondreamer is not affected by whether her husband is a Nondreamer or not. The probability of a person being a Nondreamer is given as 0.2 (or 20%). Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.}
