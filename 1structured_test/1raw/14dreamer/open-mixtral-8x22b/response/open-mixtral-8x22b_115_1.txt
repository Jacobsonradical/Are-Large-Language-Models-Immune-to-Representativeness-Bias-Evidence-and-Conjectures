{probability: 0.2,
If the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming, then the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population. Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.}
