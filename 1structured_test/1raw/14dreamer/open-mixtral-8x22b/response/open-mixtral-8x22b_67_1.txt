{probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect his wife's classification. Therefore, the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
