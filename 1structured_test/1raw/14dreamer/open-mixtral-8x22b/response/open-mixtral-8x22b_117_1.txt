{probability: 0.2}

Given that the classification of husband and wife is found to be independent with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
