{probability: 0.2,

Explanation:
Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2. This means that regardless of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer, his wife's classification is not influenced, and she has the same probability of being a Nondreamer as any other individual in the population.}
