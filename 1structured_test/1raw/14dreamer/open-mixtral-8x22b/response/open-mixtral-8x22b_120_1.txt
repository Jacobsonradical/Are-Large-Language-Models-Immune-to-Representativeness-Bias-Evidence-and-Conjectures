{probability: 0.2, Brett's being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer, as dreaming is an independent event between spouses. Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the population, which is 20%, or 0.2 when expressed as a decimal.}
