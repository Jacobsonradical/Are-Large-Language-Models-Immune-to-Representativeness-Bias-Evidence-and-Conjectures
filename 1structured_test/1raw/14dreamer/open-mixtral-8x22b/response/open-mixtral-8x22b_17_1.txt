{probability: 0.2}

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2. This is because 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, and since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
