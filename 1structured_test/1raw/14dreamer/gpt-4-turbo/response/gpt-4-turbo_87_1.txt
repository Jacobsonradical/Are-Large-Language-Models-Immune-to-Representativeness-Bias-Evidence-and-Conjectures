Since the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or nondreamers is independent, Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not influence the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% (or 0.20) of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer remains the same as for any other person, regardless of Brett's classification.

Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
