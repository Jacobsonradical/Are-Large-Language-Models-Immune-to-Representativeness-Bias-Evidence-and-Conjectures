Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not influence his wife's classification. Thus, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given individual is a Nondreamer.

From the information provided, 20% (or 0.2) of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
