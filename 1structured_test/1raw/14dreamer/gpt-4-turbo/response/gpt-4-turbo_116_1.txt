Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. The general population probability that any given person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20. Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
