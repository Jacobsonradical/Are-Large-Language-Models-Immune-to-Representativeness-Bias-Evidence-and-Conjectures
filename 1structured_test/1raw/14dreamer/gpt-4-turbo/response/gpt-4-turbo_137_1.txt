Since the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. 

The probability that any individual is a Nondreamer, as stated, is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
