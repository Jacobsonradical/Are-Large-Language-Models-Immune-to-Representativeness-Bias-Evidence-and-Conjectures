Given that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. The probability of any individual being a Nondreamer is 20%, as stated in the problem. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.2}
