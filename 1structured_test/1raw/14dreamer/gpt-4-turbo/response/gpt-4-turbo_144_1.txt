Since the classification of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" for husband and wife is independent, Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not influence the classification of his wife. Therefore, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is also a Nondreamer is the general probability that any given person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Representing this probability as a decimal:

{probability: 0.2}
