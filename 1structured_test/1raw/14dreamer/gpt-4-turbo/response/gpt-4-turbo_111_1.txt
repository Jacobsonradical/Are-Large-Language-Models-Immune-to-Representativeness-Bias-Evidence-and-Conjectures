Given that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the dreaming status of his wife. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Expressed as a decimal, this is:

{probability: 0.2}
