Since the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers between husband and wife is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of the population are Nondreamers (which equals a probability of 0.20), and the classification is independent, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is also a Nondreamer remains 0.20.
