Since the dreaming status of husbands and wives is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. The probability that any individual (husband or wife) is a Nondreamer is given as 20%, or 0.2.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply:
{probability: 0.2}
