Since the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer is given as 20% (or 0.2), and the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
