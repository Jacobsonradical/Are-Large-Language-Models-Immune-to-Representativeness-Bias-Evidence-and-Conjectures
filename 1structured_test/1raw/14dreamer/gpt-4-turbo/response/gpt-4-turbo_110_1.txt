Since the classification of a husband and wife in terms of dreaming is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer has no effect on the classification of his wife. Therefore, we consider only the general probability that any person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.

Hence, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
