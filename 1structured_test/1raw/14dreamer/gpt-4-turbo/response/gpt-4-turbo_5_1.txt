Since the dreaming status of Brett and his wife are independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. The general probability that any person is a Nondreamer is 20%. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.2}
