Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.
