Since the dream classification of husband and wife is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not impact the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

The problem states that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, which means there is a 20% chance that any given person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability that any individual is a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.2}
