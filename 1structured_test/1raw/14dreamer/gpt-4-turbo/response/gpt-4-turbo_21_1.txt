Since the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is stated to be independent, Brett being a Nondreamer has no impact on the dreaming status of his wife.

Given:
- 20% (or 0.2) of people are Nondreamers

Hence, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers, which is 20%.

So, my answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
