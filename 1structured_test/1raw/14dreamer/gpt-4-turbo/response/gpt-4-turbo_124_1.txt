Since the dreaming status of Brett (a Nondreamer) and his wife are independent, Brett's wife's probability of being a Nondreamer remains unaffected by his dreaming status. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the general probability of anyone being a Nondreamer, which is reported as 20%.

Expressing this as a probability between 0 and 1:

{probability: 0.2}
