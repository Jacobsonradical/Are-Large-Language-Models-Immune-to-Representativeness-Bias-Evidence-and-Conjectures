Given that the classification of husband and wife with respect to being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer. This means that the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is just the overall probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
