Since the classification of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is independent between husband and wife, Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not influence the classification of his wife. The probability that any given individual is a Nondreamer is given as 20%. Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability that any person is a Nondreamer.
