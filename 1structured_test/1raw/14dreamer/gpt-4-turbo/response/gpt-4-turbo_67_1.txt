Since the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer or not. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer remains the same as the general probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.
