Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer or not.

The probability that any individual is a Nondreamer, regardless of their spouse's status, is given as 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
