Since the dreaming status of Brett (a Nondreamer) is independent of his wife's dreaming status, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer does not depend on Brett's classification.

The probability that any given person is a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.2). Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is also 0.2.
