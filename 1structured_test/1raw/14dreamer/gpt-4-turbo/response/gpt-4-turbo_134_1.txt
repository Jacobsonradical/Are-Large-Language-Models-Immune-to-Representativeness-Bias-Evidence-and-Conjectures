Since the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people report that they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 (20%).

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
