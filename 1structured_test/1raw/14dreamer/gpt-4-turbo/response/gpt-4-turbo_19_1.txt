Since the classification of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is independent between husband and wife, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of individuals claim they do not remember ever dreaming (or are Nondreamers), the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is based on this overall percentage irrespective of Brett's dream classification.

Thus, the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
