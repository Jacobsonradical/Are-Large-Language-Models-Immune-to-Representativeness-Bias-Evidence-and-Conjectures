Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer has no effect on the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer as well. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

From the information given:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Expressed as a decimal, 20% is 0.20. Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
