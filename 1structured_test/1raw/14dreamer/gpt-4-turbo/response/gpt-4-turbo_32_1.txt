Since the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer doesn't affect the classification of his wife. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer.

As given, 20% (or 0.20) of people are Nondreamers. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
