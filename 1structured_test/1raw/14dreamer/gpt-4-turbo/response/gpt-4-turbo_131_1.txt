Given that the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" between husband and wife is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

The general population data suggests that 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, regardless of Brett's status as a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer remains the general probability of someone being a Nondreamer.
