Since the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the classification of his wife. Thus, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
