Given that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers for husbands and wives is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect his wife's classification. The probability that any given individual is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
