Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer doesn't affect the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of a person being a Nondreamer as provided by the study.

The probability is therefore:

{probability: 0.2}
