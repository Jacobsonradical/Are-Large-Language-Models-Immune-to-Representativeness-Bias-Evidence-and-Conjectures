Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to being Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of the population reports they do not remember ever dreaming (and are thus classified as Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of people in the general population who are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
