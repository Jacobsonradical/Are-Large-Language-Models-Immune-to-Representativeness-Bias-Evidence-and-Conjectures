Since the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent between husband and wife, Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife's classification.

Given that 20% of the people report being Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer remains at 20%. Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
