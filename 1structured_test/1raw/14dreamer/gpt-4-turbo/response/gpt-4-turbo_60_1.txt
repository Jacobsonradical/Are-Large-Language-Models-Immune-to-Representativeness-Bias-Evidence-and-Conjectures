Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that any given person (including Brettâ€™s wife) is a Nondreamer is 0.20. 

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
