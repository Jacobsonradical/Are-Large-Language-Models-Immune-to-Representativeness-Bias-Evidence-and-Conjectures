Given that the classification of husband and wife dreaming status (Dreamer vs. Nondreamer) is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer has no influence on the dreaming status of his wife. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
