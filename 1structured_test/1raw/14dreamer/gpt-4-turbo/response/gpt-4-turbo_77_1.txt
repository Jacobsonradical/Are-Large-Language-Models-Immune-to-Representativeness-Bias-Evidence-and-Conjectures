Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Based on the information given:
20% of the population are Nondreamers.

Converting this percentage to a probability:
20% = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
