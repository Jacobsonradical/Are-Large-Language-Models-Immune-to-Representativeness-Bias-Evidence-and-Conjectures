Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer or Dreamer. The probability that any person, inclusive of his wife, is a Nondreamer is given as 20%, regardless of Brett's dreaming status.
