Since the classification of dreamers between husband and wife is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given individual is a Nondreamer, which is 20%, or 0.20.
