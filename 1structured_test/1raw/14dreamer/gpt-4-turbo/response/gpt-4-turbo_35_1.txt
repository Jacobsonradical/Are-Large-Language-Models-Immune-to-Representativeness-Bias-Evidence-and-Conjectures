Since the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not influence the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. The probability that any given person is a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.2). Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is also 0.2.
