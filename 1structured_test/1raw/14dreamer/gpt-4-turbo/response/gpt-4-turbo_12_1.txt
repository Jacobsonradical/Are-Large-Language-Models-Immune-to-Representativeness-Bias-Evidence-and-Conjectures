Since Brett's classification as a Nondreamer is independent of his wife's classification as either a Dreamer or Nondreamer, Brett's status does not impact the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of the population are Nondreamers, and the classifications are independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of the population that are Nondreamers:

{probability: 0.2}
