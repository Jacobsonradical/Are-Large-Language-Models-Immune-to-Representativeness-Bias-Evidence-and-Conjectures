Since the classification of dreaming (being a Dreamer or Nondreamer) between husband and wife is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

The probability that any individual does not remember ever dreaming (is a Nondreamer) is given as 20% or 0.20.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.
