Since the classification of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent between husband and wife, Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife's dreaming status. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of any given person being a Nondreamer, which is 20%, or 0.2 as a decimal.
