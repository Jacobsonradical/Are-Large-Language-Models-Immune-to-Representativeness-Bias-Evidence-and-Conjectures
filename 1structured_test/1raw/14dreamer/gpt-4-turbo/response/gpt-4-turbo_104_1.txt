Given that the classification of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" for a husband and wife is independent, Brett's dream status does not influence his wife's dream status.

The probability that any individual is a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.20). Since the classifications are independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer remains the same, regardless of Brett's status.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
