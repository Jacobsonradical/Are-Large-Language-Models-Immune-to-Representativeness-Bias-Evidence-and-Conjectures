Since the classification of dreaming between husband and wife is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer. 

The probability that any individual is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
