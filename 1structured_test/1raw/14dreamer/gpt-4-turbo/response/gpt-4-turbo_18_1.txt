Since the classification of dreaming between husband and wife is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

As given, 20% (or 0.2) of people do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
