Since the classification as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" for husband and wife is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% (or 0.20) of people report never remembering dreaming, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
