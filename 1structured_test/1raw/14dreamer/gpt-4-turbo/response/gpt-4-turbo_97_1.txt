Given that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer doesn't affect the classification of his wife. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that a given person is a Nondreamer.

Since it is given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%.
