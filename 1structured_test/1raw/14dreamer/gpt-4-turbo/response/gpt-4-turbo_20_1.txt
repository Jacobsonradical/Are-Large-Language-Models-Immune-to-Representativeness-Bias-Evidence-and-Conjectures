Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20%.

Expressed as a decimal, this is:

{probability: 0.2}
