Since the classification of dreaming for husband and wife is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. The data shows that 20% or 0.20 of the population are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.
