Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" between husband and wife is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability classification of his wife. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of a person being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people report that they do not remember ever dreaming (classified as Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.
