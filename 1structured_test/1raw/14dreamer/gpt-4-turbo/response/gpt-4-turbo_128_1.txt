Given that the classification of husband and wife regarding dreaming is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer.

Since 20% (or 0.2) of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (classified as Nondreamers), and given the independence in dreaming classification between husband and wife, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
