Since the dreaming classification (Dreamers vs. Nondreamers) of husband and wife is independent, Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect his wifeâ€™s classification. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer should be based solely on the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.

From the data provided, 20% of the population are Nondreamers. 

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
