Given that the classification of dreaming status between husband and wife is independent, the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. The probability that any given person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
