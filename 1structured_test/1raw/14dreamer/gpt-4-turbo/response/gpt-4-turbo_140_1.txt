Since it's given that the classification of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent between husband and wife, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Thus, we directly use the general probability of anyone being a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
