Since the classification of dreaming for a husband and wife is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that a person is a Nondreamer.

From the information given:
20% (or 0.20) of people do not remember ever dreaming.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
