Since the dreaming status of a husband and wife is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. Given that 20% of the population does not remember ever dreaming (classified as Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.2}
