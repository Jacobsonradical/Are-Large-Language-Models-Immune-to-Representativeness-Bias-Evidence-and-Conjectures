Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability classification of his wife. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Expressed as a decimal, this probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
