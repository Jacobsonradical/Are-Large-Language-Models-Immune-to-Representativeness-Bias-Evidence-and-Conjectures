Given that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer.

The general probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20. Since Brett's classification does not affect his wife's, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer remains at 20%.
