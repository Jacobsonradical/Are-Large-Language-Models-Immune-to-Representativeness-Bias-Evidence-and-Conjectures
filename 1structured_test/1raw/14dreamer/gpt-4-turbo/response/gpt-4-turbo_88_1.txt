Given that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer. 

The general likelihood, based on the study, that any individual (including Brett's wife) is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
