{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent.  **Independence** means that one person's dreaming status does not influence the other person's dreaming status. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", and Brett's wife's dreaming classification is independent of his, there is a **20% probability** that his wife is also a "Nondreamer".
