{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.  This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer tells us *nothing* about whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer remains at the baseline probability of **20%**, or **0.2**.
