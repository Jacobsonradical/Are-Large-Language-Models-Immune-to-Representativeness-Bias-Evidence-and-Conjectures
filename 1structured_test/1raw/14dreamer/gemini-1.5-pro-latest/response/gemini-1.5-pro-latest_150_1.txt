{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent. **Independence** means that knowing whether the husband is a Dreamer or Nondreamer gives us *no information* about whether the wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population probability, which is 20% or **0.2**.
