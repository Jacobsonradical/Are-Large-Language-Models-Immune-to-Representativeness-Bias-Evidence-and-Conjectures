{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.  **Independence means that knowing the husband's dream classification gives you no information about the wife's classification.**

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is also 20%, regardless of Brett's classification.
