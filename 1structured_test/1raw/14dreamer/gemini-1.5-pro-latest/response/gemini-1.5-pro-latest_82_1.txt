{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is **independent**. This means that Brett being a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer remains the same at 20%, or 0.2.
