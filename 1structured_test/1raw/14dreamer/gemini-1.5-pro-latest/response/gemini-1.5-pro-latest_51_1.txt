{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.  **Independence means that knowing the husband's dream classification gives us NO information about the wife's classification.** 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, and we have no additional information to go on, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the base rate: 20%.
