{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent. **Independence** means that one person's dreaming status doesn't influence the other person's dreaming status. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is simply the general population probability of being a "Nondreamer".  

It doesn't matter that Brett is a "Nondreamer". His status doesn't change the odds for his wife.
