{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent.  **Independence** means that knowing the husband's classification (Nondreamer) tells us *nothing* about the wife's classification. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer remains at 20%, or 0.2, regardless of Brett's classification.
