{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is **independent**. This means that Brett being a Nondreamer has *no influence* on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply **20%, or 0.2**.
