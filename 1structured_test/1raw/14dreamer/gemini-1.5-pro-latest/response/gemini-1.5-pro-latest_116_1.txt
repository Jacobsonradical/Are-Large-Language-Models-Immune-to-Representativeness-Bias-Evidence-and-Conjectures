**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent.  **Independence** means that one person's dream classification has no impact on the other person's classification.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers," and Brett's wife's dream classification is independent of his, there's a 20% chance she is also a "Nondreamer."
