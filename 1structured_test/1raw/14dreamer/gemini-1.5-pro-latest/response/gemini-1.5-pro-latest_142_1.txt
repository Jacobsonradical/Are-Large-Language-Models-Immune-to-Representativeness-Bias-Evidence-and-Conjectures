{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent.  **Independence** means that knowing the husband's classification tells us *nothing* about the wife's classification. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same as the general population frequency: 20%, or 0.2.
