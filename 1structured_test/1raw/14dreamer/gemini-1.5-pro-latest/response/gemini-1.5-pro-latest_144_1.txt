{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.  This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the population average, which is 20% or 0.2.
