{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent. **Independence** means that knowing the husband's classification (Nondreamer) gives us *no information* about the wife's classification.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or **0.2**.
