{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is **independent**.  This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer provides **no information** about whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer remains at the baseline level: 20%, or 0.2.
