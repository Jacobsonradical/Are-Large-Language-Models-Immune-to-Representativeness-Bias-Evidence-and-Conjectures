{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent. **Independence** means that one person's dream classification has no impact on the other person's classification. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers," and Brett's wife's dream classification is independent of his, the probability of his wife also being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same as the general population: 20%.
