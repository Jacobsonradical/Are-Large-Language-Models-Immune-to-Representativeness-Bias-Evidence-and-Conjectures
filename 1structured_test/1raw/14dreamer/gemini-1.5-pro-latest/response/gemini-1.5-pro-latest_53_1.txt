{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent. This means that knowing whether the husband is a Dreamer or Nondreamer doesn't give us any information about the wife's dreaming status.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is also **20%**, regardless of Brett's classification.
