{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is **independent**. This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has *no influence* on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is also **20%**, or **0.2**.
