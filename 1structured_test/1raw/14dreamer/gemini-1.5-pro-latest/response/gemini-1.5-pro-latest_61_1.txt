{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent.  This means that Brett being a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population frequency.
