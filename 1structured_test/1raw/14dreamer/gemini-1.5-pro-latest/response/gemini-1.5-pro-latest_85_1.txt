{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent. This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no bearing on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer remains the same, at **0.2 or 20%**.
