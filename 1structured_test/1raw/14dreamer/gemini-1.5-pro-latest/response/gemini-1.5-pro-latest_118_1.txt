{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.  This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the population proportion of Nondreamers, which is **0.2**.
