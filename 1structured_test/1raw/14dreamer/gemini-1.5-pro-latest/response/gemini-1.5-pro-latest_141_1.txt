{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.  This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is also **20%**, regardless of Brett's classification.
