{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent.  **Independence means that knowing Brett's dream classification tells us nothing about his wife's classification.** 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same as the general population prevalence: 20%, or 0.2.
