{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent.  **Independence** means that one person's dream classification has no bearing on the other person's classification.

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is simply the population proportion of "Nondreamers", regardless of Brett's classification.
