{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife dreaming is independent.  This means Brett's classification as a Nondreamer has no impact on his wife's likelihood of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population frequency.
