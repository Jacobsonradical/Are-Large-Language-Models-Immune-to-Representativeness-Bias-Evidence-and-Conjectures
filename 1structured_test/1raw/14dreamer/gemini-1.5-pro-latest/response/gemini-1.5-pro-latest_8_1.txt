{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nonreamers is independent.  This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has *no influence* on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 20%, or 0.2.
