{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent. **Independence** means that knowing the husband's dream classification (Nondreamer) gives us *no information* about the wife's classification. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer remains the same as the general population, regardless of Brett's classification.
