{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is **independent**. This means that Brett being a Nondreamer has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer.

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population: 20%, or 0.2.
