{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent.  **Independence means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has absolutely no bearing on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.** 

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the population average.
