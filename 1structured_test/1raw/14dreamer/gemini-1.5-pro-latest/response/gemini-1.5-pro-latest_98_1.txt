{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is **independent**. This means that the husband's dreaming status has no influence on the wife's dreaming status, and vice versa.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is also **20%**, regardless of Brett's status.
