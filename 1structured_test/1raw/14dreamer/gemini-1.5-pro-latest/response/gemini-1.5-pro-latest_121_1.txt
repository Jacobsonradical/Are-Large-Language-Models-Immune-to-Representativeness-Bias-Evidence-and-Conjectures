{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent.  **Independence** means that one person's dream classification has no impact on the other person's classification.

Since the overall probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, and Brett's wife's classification is independent of his, the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer remains at **20% or 0.2**.
