**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent. **Independence** means that knowing whether the husband is a dreamer or non-dreamer provides *no information* about the wife's classification.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", and Brett's wife's classification is independent of his, there's a 20% chance she is also a "Nondreamer".
