{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The statement indicates that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent. **Independence** means that knowing whether the husband is a dreamer or non-dreamer provides *no information* about the wife's classification. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer remains the same (20% or 0.2) regardless of his classification.
