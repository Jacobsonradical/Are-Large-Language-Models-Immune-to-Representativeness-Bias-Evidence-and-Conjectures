{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent. **Independence** means that one person's dream classification has no influence on the other person's classification.

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is simply the same as the population average, regardless of Brett's classification.
