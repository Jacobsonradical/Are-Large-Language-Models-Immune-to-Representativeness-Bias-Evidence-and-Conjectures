{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife as dreamers or non-dreamers is independent. **Independence** means that one person's dreaming status has no influence on the other person's dreaming status.

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is simply the population probability, regardless of Brett's status.
