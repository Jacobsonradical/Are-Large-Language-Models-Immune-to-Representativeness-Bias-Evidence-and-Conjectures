From the information given, we know:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers
- The dreaming classification of husband and wife is independent

If the classification is independent, then the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
