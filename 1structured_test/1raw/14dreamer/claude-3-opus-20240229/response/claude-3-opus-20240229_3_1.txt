Based on the information provided, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, since the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
