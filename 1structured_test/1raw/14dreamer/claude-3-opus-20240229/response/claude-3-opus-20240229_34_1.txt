According to the information provided:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" and 20% as "Nondreamers"
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
