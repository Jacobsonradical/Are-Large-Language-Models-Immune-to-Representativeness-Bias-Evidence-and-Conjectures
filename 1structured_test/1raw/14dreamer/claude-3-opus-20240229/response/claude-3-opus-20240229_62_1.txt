According to the given information, the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that whether Brett's wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer does not depend on Brett being a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent and 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
