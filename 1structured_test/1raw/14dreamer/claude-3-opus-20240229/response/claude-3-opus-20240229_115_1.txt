Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the following:

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

According to the given information, 20% of people are Nondreamers. In other words, the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
