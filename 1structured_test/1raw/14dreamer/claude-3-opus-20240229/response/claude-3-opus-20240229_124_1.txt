To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the following information:

1. 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
2. People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
3. The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Given:
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer.

We know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
