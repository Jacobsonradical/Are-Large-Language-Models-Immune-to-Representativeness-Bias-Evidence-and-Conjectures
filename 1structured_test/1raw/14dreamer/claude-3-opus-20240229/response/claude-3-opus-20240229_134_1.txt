To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given about the independence of dreaming classification between husband and wife.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the dreaming classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
