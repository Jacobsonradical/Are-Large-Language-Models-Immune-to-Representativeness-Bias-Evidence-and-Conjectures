In this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer. Since the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of a random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
