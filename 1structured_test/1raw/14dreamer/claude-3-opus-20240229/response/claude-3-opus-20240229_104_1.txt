In this problem, we need to determine the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is not affected by Brett's classification. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
