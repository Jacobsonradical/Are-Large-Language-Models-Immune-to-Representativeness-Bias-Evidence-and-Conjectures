To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the following information:

1. 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
2. The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Given:
- P(Nondreamer) = 0.2
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

If the classification of husband and wife is independent, then the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
