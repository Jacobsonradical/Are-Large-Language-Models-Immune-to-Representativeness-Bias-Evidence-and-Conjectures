To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the following information:

- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Given:
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
