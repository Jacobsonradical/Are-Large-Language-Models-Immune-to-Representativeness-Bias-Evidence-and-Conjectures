In this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the general population, since the classification of husband and wife is independent.

The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%).

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
