To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information:

1. 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
2. People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
3. The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
