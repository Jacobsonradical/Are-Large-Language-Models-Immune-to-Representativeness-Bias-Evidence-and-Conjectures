According to the given information, the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.

The data shows that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are thus classified as "Nondreamers".

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
