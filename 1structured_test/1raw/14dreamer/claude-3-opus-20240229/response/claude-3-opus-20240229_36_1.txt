To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given in the problem.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

Probability of a person being a Nondreamer = 20% = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
