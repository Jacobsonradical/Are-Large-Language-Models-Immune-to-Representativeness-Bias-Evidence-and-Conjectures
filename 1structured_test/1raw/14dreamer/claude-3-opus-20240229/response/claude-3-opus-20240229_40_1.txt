Based on the given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer and the classification of dreaming is independent between husband and wife, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
