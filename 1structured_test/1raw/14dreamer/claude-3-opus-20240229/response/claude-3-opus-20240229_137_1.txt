To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the independence of dreaming classification between husband and wife.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

If the classification of dreaming is independent between husband and wife, then the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
