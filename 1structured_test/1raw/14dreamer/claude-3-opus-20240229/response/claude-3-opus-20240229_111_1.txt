To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given in the question.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. According to the question, the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.

2. Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
