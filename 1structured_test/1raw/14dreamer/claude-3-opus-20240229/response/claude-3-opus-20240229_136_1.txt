To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the following information:

- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Given:
- P(Nondreamer) = 0.2
- P(Dreamer) = 0.8
- The dreaming classification of husband and wife is independent.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
