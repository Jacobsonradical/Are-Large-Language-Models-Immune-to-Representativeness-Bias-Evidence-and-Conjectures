To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given in the question. The key points are:

1. 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
2. People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
3. The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

According to the given information, 20% of people are Nondreamers. In probability, we express this as 0.2 (20% = 20/100 = 0.2).

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
