From the given information, we know that:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent

If the classification of husband and wife is independent, then the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
