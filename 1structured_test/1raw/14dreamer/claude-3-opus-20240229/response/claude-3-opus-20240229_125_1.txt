To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information provided in the question. The key point is that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

If the classification is independent, then the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
