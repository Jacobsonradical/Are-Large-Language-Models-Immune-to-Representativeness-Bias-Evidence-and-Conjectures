To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information:

- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
