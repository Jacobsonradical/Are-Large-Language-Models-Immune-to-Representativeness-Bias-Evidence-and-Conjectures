To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the following information:

1. 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
2. The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Given that the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
