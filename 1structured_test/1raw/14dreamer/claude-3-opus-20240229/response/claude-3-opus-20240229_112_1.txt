In this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer. The key information provided is that the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.

If the classification is independent, then the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
