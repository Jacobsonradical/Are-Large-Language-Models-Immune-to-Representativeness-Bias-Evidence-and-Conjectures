To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given in the problem. The key point is that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

If the classification of husband and wife is independent, then the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
