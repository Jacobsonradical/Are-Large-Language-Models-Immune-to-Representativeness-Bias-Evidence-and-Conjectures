Given the information provided, we can determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer using the following reasoning:

1. The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.
2. The probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2, regardless of their sex.

Since the dreaming classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
