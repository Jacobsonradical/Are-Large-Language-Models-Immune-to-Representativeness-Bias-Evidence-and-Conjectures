To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information given in the problem. The key piece of information is that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

If the classification is independent, then the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
