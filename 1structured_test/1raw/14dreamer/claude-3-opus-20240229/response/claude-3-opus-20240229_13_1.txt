To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided in the question.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

If the classification of husband and wife is independent, then the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
