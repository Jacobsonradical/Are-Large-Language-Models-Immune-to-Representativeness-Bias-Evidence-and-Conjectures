To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given about the proportion of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population, and the fact that the dreaming classification of husband and wife is independent.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
