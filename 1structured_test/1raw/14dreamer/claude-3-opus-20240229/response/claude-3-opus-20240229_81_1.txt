Given the information provided:
- 80% of people report dreaming, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
