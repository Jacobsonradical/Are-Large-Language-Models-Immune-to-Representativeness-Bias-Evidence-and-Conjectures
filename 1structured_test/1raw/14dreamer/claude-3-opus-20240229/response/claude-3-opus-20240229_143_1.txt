In this scenario, we are told that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent. This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
