From the given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

If Brett is a Nondreamer, and the classification of dreaming between husband and wife is independent, then the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
