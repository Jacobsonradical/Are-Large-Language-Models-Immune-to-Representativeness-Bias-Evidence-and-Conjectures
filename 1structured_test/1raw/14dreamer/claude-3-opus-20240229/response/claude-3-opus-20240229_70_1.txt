To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given:
* 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
* 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)
* The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
