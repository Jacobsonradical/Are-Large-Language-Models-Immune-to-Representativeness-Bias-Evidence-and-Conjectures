In this problem, we need to find the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer. Since the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer.

From the given information, we know that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
