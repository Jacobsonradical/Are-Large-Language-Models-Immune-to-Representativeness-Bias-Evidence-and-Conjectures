In this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer. Since the classification of husband and wife was found to be independent with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
