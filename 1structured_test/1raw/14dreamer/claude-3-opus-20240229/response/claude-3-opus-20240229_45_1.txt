To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming, we can use the following information:

- 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers"
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers"

Since the dreaming classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
