To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information:

1. 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
2. The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
