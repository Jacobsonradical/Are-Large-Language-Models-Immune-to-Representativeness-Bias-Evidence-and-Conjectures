To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the following information:

1. The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.
2. 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
