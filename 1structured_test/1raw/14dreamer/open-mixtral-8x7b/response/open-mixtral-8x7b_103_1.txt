{probability: 0.20}

The classification of dreaming or not dreaming for a husband and wife are independent events. This means that one person being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of their spouse being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, there is a 20% chance that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.
