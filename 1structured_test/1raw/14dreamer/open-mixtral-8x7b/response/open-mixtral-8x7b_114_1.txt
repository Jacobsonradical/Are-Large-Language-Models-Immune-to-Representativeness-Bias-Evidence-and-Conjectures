{probability: 0.2}

The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the dreaming status of his wife, as the classifications are independent. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, there is a 20% (or 0.2) probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's dreaming status.
