{probability: 0.20}

The classification of husband and wife regarding dreaming is independent. This means that the dreaming status of one partner does not affect the dreaming status of the other partner. Since Brett is a Nondreamer (which occurs in 20% of people), his wife has a 20% (or 0.20) probability of also being a Nondreamer.
