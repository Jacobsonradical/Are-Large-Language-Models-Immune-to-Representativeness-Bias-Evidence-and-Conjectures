{probability: 0.2}

The classification of dreaming or not dreaming for a husband and wife are independent events. This means that one person being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of their spouse being a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, there is a 20% (or 0.2) chance that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.
