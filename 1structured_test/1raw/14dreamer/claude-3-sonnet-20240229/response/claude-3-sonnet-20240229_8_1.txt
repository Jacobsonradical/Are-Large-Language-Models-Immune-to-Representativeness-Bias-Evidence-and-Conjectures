To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independent events and the given information about the proportion of Dreamers and Nondreamers.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
