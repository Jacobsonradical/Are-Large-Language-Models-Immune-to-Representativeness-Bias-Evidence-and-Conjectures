To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to know the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
