{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- Given that 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers"
- It is stated that the classification of husband and wife is independent
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
