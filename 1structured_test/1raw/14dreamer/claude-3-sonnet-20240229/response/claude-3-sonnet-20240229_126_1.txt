{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, this does not affect the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.
- The data given states that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%, since this classification is independent for each person.
