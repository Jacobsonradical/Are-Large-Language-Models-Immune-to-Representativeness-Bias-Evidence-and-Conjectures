To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" (individuals who remember dreaming).
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (individuals who claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
