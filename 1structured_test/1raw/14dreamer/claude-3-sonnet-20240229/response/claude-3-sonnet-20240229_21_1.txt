To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independent events and the given information about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream (Dreamers).
- 20% of people of both sexes claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
