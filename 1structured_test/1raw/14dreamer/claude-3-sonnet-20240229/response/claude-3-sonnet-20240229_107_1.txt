{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The problem states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- It also states that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
- The independence between the husband's and wife's classifications means that Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
