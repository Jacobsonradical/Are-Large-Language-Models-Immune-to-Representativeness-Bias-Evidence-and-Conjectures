To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
