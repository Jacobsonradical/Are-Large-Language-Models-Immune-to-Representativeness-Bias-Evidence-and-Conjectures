To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the concept of independent events.

Given information:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers", and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
