To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the concept of independent events.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" (denoted as P(Dreamer) = 0.8).
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers" (denoted as P(Nondreamer) = 0.2).
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

Brett is a Nondreamer, so we want to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
