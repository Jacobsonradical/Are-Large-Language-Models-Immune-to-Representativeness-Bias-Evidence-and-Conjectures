{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- There are two possible classifications for dreaming: "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer".
- The given information states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- It is also stated that the classification of husband and wife is independent.
- Since Brett is a "Nondreamer", the probability that his wife is also a "Nondreamer" is equal to the overall probability of being a "Nondreamer", which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.2.
