To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

Let's denote the events:
- B: Brett is a Nondreamer
- W: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(W|B), which is the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, we can use the following formula:

P(W|B) = P(W)

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
