{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" and 80% as "Dreamers".
- It also states that the classification of husband and wife is independent.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
- The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer, since their classifications are independent events.
