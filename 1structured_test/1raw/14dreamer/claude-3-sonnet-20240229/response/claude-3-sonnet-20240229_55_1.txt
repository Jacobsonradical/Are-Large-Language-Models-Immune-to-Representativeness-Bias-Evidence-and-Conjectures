To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply the concept of independent events.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" (P(Dreamer) = 0.8).
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (P(Nondreamer) = 0.2).
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
