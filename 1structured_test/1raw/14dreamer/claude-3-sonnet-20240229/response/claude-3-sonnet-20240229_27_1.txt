{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 80% of people (both sexes) report dreaming, which means 20% are classified as "Nondreamers".
- It also states that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the classification is independent, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
