To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
