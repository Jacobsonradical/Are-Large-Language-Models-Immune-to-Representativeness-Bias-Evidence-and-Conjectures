{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- It also states that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability that a person is a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
- The independence condition means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
