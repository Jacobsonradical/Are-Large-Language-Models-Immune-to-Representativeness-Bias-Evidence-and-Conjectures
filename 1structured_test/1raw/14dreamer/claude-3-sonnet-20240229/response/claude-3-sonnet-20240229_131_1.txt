To find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided in the problem statement.

The problem states that:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream (i.e., they are Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., they are Nondreamers)
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is:

{probability: 0.2}
