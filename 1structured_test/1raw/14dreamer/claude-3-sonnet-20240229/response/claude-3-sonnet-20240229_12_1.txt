To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population, and the fact that the classification of husband and wife is independent.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
