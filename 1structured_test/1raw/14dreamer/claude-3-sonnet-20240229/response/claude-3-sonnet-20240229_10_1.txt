To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided in the question.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" (i.e., they dream, if only occasionally).
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (i.e., they claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
