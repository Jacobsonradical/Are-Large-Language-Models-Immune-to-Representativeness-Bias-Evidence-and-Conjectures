To find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided in the problem statement.

According to the problem, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," which means that the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.2.

Since the classification of husband and wife was found to be independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is not affected by the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
