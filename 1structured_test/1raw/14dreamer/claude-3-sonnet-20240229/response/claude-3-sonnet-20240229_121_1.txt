To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided in the question.

According to the question:
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
