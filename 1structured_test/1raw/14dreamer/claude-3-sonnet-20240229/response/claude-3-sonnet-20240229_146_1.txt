To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided in the problem statement.

According to the problem statement:
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (i.e., they do not remember ever dreaming).
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the classification is independent for the husband and wife, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer remains the same as the general probability for any individual, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
