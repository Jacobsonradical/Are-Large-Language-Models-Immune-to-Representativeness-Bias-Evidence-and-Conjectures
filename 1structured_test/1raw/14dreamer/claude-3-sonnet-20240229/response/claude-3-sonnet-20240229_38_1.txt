{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
