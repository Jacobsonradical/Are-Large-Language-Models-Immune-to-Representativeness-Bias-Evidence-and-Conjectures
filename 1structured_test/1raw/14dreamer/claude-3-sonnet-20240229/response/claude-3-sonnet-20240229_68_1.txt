To find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided in the problem statement.

Since the classification of husband and wife was found to be independent, the event of Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

According to the problem statement, 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, i.e., they are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
