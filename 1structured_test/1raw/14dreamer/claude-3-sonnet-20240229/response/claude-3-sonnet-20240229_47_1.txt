{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers."
- It also states that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
