{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- 20% of people (0.2) are classified as "Nondreamers"
- The classification of husband and wife is independent
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer remains at 0.2 (20%), the base rate for Nondreamers in the population.

So the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, is 0.2.
