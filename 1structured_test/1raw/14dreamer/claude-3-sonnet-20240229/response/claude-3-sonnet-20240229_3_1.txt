To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Let's denote the event that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer as A.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer (P(A)) is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer.

From the given information, the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
