To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independent events and the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers."

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
