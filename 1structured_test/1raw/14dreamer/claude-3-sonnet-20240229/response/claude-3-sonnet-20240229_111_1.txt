To find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided in the problem statement.

Given:
- 80% of people (of both sexes) are classified as "Dreamers," and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers."
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
