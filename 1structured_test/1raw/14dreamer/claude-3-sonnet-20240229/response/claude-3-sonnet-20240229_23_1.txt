{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
1) We are told that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", meaning they do not remember ever dreaming.
2) We are also told that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
3) Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
4) The fact that the classifications are independent means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
