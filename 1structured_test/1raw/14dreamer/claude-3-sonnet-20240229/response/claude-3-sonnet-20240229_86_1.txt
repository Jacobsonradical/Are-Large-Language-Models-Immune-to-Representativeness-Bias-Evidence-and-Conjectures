{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The problem states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (i.e., those who claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- It is also given that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, is 0.2.
