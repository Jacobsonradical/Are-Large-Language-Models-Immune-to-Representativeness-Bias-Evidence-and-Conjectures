{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (i.e., those who claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- It is also given that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and this classification is independent of his wife's status, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer remains the same as the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.
