{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The statement says that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.2.
- It also states that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, this does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer, due to the independence.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer remains 0.2, which is the overall probability of being a Nondreamer.
