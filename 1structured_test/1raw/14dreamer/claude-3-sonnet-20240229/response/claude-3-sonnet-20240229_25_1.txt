To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the concept of independent events.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers," and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers."
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
