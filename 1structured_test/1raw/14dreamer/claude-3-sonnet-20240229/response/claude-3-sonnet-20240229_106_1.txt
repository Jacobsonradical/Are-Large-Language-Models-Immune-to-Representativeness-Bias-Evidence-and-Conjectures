To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and the given information that the classification of husband and wife is independent.

Given information:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
