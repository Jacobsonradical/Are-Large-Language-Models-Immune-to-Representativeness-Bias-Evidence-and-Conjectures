{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers", meaning 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The question states that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that he is a Nondreamer, is 0.2.
