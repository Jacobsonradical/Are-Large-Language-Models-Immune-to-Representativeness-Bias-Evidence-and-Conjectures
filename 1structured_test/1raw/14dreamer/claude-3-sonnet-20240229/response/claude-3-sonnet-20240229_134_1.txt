To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the independence of the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
