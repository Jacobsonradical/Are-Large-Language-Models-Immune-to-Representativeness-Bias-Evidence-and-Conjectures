To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that a randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
