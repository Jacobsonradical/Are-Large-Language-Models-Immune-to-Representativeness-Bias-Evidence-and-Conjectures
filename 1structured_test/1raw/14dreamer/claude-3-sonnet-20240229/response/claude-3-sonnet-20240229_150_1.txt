To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the concept of independent events.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" (i.e., remember dreaming).
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers" (i.e., do not remember dreaming).
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent.
- Brett is a "Nondreamer".

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is the same as the general probability of being a "Nondreamer" in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.2}
