To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" (i.e., 20% are "Nondreamers").
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
