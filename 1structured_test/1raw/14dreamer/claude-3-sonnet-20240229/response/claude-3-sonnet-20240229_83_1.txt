{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The problem states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (i.e., they claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- It is also given that the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, is 0.2.
