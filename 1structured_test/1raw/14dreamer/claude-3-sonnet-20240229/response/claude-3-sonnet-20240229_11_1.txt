To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
