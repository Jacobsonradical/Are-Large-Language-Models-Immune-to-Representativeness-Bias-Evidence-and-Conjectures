To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the concept of independent events.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
