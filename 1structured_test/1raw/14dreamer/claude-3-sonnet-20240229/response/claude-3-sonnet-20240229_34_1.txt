To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
