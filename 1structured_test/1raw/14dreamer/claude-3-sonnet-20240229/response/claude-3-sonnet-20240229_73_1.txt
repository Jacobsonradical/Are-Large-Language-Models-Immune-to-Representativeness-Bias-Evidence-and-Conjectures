To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the independence of the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is not affected by the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
