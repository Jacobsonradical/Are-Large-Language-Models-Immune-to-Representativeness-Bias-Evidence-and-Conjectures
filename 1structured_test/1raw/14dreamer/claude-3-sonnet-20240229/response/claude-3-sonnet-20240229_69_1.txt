{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" who do not remember ever dreaming.
- It also states that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, is 0.2.
