The problem states that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent. This means that the dreaming status of one spouse does not influence the dreaming status of the other.

Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and since Brett's wife's dreaming status is independent of Brett's, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{{probability: 0.2}} \]
