Given that the classification of dreaming between husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.

Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
