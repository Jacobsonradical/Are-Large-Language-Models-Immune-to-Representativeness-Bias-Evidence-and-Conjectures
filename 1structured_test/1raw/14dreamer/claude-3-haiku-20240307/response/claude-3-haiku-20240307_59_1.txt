To solve this problem, we can use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification between husband and wife.

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the percentage of Nondreamers in the population.

{probability: 0.2}

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
