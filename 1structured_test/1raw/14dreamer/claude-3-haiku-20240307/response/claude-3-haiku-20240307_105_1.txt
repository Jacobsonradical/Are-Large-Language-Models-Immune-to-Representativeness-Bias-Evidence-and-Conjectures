To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification of husband and wife.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is as follows:
- The probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (20%).
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.
