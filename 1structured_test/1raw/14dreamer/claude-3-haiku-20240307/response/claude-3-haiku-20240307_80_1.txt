To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability and the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
