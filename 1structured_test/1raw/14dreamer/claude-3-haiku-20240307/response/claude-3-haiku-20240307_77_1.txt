To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability that she is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the formula for conditional probability:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, we can multiply the probabilities:
P(wife is a Nondreamer and Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(wife is a Nondreamer) × P(Brett is a Nondreamer)

We know that P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.2 (20% of people are Nondreamers).
We also know that P(wife is a Nondreamer) = 0.2 (20% of people are Nondreamers).

Substituting the values:
P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = (0.2 × 0.2) / 0.2 = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
