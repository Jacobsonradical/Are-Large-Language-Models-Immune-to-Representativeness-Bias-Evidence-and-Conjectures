To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, even if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a "Nondreamer", the probability that his wife is also a "Nondreamer" is the probability of both individuals being "Nondreamers".

The probability of an individual being a "Nondreamer" is 0.20 (or 20%).

Given that the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that both Brett and his wife are "Nondreamers" is the product of their individual probabilities:

{probability: 0.20, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
