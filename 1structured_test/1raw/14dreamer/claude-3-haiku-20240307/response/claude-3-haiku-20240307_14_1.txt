To solve this problem, we can use the concept of independence. Since the classification of husband and wife is found to be independent with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
