To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification of husband and wife.

Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers," and 20% are "Nondreamers."
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

Since Brett is a "Nondreamer," the probability that his wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is independent of Brett's classification. Since 20% of people are "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.20 or 20%.
