To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
- Since the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, the probability that the wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
