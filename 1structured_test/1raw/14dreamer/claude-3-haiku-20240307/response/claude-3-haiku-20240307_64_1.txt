To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of the wife being a Nondreamer given that the husband is a Nondreamer.

Using the independence of the classification, we can calculate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20, or 20%, since the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% regardless of the spouse's dreaming status.
