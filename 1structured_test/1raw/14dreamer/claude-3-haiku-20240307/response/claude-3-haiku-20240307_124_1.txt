To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, at least occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of both being Nondreamers, which is the product of their individual probabilities of being Nondreamers.

The probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
