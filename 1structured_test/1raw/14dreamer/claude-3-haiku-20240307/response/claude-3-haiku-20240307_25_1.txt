To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
If the classification of husband and wife is independent, then the probability that the wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
