To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.
