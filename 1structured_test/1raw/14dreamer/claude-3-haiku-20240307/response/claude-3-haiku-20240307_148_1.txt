To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and non-dreamers, and the independence of the classification between husband and wife.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers", and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the principle of conditional probability.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
