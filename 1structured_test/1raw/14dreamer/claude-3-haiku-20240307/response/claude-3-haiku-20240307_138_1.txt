To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification for a husband and wife.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
- The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 20%.
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%.
