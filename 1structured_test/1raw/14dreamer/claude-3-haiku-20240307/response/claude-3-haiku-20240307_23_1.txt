To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

This is because the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, meaning that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.
