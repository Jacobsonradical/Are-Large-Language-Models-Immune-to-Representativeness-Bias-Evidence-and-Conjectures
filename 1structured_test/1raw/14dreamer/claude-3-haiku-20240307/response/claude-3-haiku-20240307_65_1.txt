To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
