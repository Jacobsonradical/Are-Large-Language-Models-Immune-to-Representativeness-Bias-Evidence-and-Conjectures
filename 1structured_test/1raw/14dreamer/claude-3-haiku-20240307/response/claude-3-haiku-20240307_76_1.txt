To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers." This means that the probability of a person being a Nonreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a random person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
