To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the classification of husband and wife is independent, and the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%).
