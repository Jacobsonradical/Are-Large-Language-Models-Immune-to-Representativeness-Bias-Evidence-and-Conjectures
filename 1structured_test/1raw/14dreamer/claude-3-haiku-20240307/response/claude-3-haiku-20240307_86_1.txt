To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and the given information about the distribution of dreamers and non-dreamers.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of his wife being a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the information provided, we can calculate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
