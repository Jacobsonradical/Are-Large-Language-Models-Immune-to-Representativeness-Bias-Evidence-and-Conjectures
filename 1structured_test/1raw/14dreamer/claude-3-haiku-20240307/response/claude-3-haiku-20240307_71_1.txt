To solve this problem, we can use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers."

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife is independent, which means that the probability of the wife being a Nondreamer is not affected by the fact that the husband is a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.

Since the classification is independent, the probability of the wife being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
