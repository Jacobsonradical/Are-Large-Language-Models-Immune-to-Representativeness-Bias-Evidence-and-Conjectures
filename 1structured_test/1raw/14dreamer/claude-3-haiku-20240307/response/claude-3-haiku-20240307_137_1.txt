To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of the wife being a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
