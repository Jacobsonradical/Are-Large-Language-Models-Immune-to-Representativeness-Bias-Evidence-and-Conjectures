To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any random person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
- This is because the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, meaning that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
