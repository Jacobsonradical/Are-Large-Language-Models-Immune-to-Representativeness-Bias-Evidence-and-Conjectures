To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability and the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%).
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (the same as the general population).
