To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. These 20% are classified as "Nondreamers".

The problem also states that the classification of husband and wife is found to be independent, which means that the fact that one spouse is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that the other spouse is a Nondreamer.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.
