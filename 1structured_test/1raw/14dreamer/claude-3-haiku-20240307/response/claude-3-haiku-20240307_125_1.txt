To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification of husband and wife.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
