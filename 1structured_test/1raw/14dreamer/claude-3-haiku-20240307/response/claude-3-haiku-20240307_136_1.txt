To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population, and the fact that the classification of husband and wife is independent.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
