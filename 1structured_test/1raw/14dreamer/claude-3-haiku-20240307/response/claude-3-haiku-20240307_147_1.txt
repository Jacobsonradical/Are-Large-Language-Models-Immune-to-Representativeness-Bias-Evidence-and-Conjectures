To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2, as the classification of husband and wife is independent.
- This is because the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20%, regardless of their spouse's dreaming status.
