To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

According to the information provided, 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers. Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
