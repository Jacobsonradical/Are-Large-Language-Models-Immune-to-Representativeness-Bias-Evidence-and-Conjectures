To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two independent events occurring together, which is the product of their individual probabilities.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = Probability that Brett is a Nondreamer × Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer
Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = 0.20 × 0.20 = 0.04

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.04}
