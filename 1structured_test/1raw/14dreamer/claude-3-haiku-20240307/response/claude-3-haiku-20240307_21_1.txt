To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers"

Since the classification of husband and wife is found to be independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), and this probability is independent of their spouse's dreaming status.
