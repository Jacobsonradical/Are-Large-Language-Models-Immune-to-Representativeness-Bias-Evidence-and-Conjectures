To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information that the classification of husband and wife is independent.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of her being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
