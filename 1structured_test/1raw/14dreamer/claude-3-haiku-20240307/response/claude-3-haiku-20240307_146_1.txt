To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people report dreaming, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

The problem also states that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming. This means that the probability of the wife being a Nondreamer is not affected by the fact that the husband is a Nondreamer.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
