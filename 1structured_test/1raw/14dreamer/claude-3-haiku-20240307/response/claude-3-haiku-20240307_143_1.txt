To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability and the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we want to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability that she is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer. This is because the classification of husband and wife is independent.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.2 (or 20%).
