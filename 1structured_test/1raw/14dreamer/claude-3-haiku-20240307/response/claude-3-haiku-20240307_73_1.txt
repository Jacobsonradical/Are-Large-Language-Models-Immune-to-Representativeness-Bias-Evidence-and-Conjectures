To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we can calculate the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

{probability: your answer, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
{probability: 0.2}

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%, as the classification of husband and wife is independent, and the probability of being a Nondreamer in the population is 20%.
