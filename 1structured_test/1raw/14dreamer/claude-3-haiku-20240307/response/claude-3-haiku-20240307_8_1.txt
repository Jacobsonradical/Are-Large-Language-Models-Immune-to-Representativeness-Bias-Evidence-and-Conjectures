To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people (both sexes) report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2, as the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.
