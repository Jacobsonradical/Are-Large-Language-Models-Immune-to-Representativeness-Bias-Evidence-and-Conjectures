To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett's wife is a Nondreamer

We are interested in finding P(B|A), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, we can use the following formula:

P(B|A) = P(B)

We know that 20% of people are Nondreamers, so:
P(B) = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
