To solve this problem, we can use the concept of independence in probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
