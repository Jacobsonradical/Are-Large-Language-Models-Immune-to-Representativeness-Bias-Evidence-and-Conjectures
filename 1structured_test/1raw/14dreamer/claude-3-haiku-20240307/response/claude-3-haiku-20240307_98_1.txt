To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of her being a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the given information, we can calculate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
