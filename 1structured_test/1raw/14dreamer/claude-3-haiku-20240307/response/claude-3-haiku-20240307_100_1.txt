To solve this problem, we can use the information given about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

Since Brett is a "Nondreamer", the probability that his wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a "Nondreamer", which is 20% or 0.2.
- This is because the classification of husband and wife is independent, meaning that the wife's dreaming status is not affected by the husband's dreaming status.
