To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

This is because the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming, meaning that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.
