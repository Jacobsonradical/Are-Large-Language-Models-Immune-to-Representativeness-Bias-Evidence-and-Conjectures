To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportion of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream, at least occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%) because the proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 20%, and the classification of husband and wife is independent.
