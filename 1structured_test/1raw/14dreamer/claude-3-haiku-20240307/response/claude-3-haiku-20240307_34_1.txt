To solve this problem, we can use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
