To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people (both sexes) report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that the wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
