To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and non-dreamers in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a dreamer is 0.80 and the probability of being a non-dreamer is 0.20.

The problem also states that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming. This means that the fact that the husband is a non-dreamer does not affect the probability that the wife is also a non-dreamer.

Therefore, the probability that the wife is also a non-dreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
