To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people, both male and female, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of the wife being a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
