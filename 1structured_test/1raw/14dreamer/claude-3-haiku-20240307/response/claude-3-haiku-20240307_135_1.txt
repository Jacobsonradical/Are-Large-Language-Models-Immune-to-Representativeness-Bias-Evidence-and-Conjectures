To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
