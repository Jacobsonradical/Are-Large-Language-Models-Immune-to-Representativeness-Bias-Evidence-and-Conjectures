To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification of husband and wife.

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

This is because the classification of husband and wife is independent, meaning that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. The probability remains the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
