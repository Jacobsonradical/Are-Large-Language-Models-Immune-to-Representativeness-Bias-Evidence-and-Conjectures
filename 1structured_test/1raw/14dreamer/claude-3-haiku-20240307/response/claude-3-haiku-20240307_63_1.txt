To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and the given information about the distribution of dreamers and non-dreamers.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the classification of the husband and wife is independent, and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20 for the general population.
