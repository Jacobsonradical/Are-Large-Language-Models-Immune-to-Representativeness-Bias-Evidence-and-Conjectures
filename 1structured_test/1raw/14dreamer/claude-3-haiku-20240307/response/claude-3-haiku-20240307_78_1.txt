To solve this problem, we can use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, which is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
