To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the classification of people based on dreaming.

According to the given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:
