To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the probabilities of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer".

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20% or 0.2, since the classification of husband and wife is independent.
