To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we can assume that the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
