To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and non-dreamers in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people report dreaming, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Since the classification of husband and wife is found to be independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
