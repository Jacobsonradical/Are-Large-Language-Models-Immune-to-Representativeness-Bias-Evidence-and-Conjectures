To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification between husband and wife.

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
