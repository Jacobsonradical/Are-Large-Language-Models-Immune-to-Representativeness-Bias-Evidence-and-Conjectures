To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of both being Nondreamers, which is the product of their individual probabilities.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = 0.20 (since 20% of people are Nondreamers).

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
