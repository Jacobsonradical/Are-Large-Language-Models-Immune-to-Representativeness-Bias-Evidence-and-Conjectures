Given the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because if 20% of the population are Nondreamers, and the classification of husband and wife is independent, then the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
