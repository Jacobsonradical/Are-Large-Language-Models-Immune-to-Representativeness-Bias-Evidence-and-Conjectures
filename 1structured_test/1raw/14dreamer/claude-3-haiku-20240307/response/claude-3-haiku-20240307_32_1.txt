To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification between husband and wife.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%).
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that the wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, regardless of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
