The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
