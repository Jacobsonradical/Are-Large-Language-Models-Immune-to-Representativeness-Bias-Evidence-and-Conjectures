To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

According to the problem statement, 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2, regardless of their spouse's dreaming status.
