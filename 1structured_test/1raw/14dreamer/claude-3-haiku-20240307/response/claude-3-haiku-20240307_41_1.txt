To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the remaining 20% of the population.

{probability: 0.2}
