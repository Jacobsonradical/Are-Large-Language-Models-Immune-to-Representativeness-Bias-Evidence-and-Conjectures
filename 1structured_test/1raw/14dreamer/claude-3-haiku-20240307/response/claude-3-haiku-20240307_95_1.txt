To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

This is because the classification of husband and wife is independent, meaning that the wife's status as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is not affected by the husband's status.
