To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
