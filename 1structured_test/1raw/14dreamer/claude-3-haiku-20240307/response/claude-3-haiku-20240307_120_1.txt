To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent.

Since Brett is a "Nondreamer", the probability that his wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
If the classification of husband and wife is independent, then the probability that the wife is a "Nondreamer" is the same as the overall probability of a person being a "Nondreamer", which is 20% or 0.20.
