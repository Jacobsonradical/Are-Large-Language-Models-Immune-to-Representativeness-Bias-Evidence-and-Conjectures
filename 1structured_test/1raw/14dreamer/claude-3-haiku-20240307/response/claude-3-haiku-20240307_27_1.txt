To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, even if occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of the wife being a Nondreamer, given that the husband is a Nondreamer.

The probability that the wife is a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that the wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2, since the proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 20%.

The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent, so the probability that the wife is a Nondreamer does not depend on the husband's status as a Nondreamer.
