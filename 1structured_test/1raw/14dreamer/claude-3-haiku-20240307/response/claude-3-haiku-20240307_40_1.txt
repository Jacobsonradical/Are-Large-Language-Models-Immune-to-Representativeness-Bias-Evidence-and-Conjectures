To solve this problem, we can use the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification between husband and wife.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
