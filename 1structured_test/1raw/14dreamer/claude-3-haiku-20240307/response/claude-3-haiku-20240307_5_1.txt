To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
