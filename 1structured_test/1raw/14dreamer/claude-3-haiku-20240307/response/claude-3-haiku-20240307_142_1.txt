To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification of husband and wife.

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the classification of husband and wife is independent, and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% for both men and women.
