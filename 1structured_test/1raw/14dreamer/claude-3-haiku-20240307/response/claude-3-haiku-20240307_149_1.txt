To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification of husband and wife.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
