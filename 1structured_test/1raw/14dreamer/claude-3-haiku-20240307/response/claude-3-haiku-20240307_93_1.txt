To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
If the classification of husband and wife is independent, then the probability that the wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
