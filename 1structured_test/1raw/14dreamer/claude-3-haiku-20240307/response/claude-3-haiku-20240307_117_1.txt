To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report dreaming.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of her being a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
