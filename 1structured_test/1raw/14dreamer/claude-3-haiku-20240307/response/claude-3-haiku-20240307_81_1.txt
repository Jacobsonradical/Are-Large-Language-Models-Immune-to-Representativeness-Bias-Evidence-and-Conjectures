To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%, as this is the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent, meaning that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.
