To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%) because the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent. The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer, which remains 0.2 (20%) based on the given information.
