To solve this problem, we can use the information provided about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), as the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population is 80% and 20%, respectively. Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2.
