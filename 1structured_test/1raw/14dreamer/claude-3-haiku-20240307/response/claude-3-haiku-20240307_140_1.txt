To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer.
- The probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.
