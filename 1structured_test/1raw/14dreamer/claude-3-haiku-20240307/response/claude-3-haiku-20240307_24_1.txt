To solve this problem, we can use the concept of independent events.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer. Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
