To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

The problem states that the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming. This means that the probability of the wife being a Nondreamer is not affected by the husband being a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because if 20% of the population are Nondreamers, and the classification of husband and wife is independent, then the probability that the wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
