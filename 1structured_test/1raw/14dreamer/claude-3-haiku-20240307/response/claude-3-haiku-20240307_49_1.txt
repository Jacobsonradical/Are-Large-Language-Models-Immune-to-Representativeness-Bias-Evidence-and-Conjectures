To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report dreaming.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2. This is because the classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.
