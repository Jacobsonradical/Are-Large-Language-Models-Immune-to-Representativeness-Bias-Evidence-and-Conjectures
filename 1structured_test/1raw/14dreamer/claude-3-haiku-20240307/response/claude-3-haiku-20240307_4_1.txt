To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers.

The information tells us that 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers. Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
