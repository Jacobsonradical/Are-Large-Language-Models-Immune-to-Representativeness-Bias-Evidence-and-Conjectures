To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), since the classification of husband and wife is independent, and 20% of people are Nondreamers.
