To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
