To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification for husband and wife.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20, because the classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent. Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
