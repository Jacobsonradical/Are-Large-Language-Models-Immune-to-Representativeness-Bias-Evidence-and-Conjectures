To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification between husband and wife.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- If the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that the wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
