To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability and the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a "Nondreamer".

The probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is the same as the probability of any person being a "Nondreamer", which is 20% or 0.2.
