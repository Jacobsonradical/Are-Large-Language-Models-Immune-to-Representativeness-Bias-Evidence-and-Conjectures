To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of the wife being a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability of the wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
