To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
