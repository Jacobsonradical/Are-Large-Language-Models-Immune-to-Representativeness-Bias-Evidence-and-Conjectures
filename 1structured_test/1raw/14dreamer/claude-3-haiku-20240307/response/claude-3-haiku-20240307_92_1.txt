To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the prevalence of dreaming and the independence of the classification of husband and wife.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.

This is because the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming. The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any additional information about the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
