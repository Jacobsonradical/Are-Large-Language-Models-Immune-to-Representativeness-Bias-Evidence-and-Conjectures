To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% (0.20) for both Brett and his wife, and their classifications are independent.
