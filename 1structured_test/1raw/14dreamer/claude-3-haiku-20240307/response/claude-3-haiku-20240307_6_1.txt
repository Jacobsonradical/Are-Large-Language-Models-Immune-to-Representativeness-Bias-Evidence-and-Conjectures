To solve this problem, we can use the concept of independent events.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
