To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.
