To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

The study states that 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".

Since the classification of husband and wife is found to be independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
