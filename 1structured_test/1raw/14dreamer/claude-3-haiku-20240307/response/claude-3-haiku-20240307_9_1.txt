To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of husband and wife as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20, and this probability is independent for the husband and wife.
