To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability and the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers."
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the following formula:

{probability: your answer, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = P(wife is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer)

Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, we can use the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
