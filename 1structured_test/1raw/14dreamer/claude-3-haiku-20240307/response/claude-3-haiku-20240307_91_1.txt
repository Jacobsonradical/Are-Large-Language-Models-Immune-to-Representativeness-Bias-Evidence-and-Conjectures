To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided about the classification of people as "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%, as the classification of husband and wife is independent, and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% for both men and women.
