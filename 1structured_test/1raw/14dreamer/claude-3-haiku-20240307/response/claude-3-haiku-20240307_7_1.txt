To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a "Nondreamer", the probability that his wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
If the classification of husband and wife is independent, then the probability that the wife is a "Nondreamer" is the same as the overall probability of being a "Nondreamer" in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
