To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the independence of the classification of husband and wife.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer = {probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
- The classification of husband and wife is independent, which means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.
- According to the given information, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
