To solve this problem, we can use the information provided about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers."

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers."
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20, because the classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming. The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer, which is 20% regardless of his status.
