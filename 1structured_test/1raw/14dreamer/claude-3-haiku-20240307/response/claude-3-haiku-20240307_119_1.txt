To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%).
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
