To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information that the classification of husband and wife with respect to dreaming is independent.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
