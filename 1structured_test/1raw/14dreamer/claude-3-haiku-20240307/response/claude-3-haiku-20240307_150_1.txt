To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

The information states that 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a "Nondreamer" is 0.2 or 20%.

Since the classification of husband and wife is found to be independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
