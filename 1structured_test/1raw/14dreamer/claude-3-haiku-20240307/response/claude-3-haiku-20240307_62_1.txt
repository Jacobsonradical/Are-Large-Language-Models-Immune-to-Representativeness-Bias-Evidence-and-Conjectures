To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is independent with respect to dreaming.

Since Brett is a "Nondreamer", the probability that his wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- Since the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is the same as the probability of a random person being a "Nondreamer", which is 20% or 0.2.
