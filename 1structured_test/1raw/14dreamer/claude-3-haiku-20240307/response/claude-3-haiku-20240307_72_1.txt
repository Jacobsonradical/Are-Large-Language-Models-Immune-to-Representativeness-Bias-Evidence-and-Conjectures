To answer this question, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".

The classification of husband and wife was found to be independent, which means that the fact that one spouse is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that the other spouse is a Nondreamer.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population is 20% or 0.2.
