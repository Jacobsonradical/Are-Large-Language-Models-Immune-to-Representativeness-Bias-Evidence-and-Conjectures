To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is as follows:
- If the classification of husband and wife is independent, the probability that the wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general population proportion of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.20.
