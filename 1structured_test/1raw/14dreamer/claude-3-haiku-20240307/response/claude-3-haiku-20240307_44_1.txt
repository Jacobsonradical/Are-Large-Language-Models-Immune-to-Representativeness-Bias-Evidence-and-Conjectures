To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the classification of people based on dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of husband and wife is found to be independent.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the classification of husband and wife is independent, and the probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.
