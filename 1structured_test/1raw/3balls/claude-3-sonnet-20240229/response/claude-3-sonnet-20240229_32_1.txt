To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to obtain each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To obtain this case, we need to distribute the balls in such a way that each child gets exactly 2 balls.
The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls, is given by the combination formula:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, one child gets 3 balls, and the other two children get 2 and 1 ball, respectively.
The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children, with one child getting 3 balls and the other two children getting 2 and 1 ball, is given by:
C(6, 3) × C(3, 2) × C(3, 1) = 20 × 3 × 3 = 180

Since there are 180 possible ways to obtain Case 2 and only 90 possible ways to obtain Case 1, Case 2 will occur more often than Case 1.
