To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of possible outcomes and then count the number of outcomes corresponding to each case.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

The total number of possible outcomes is given by the combination formula:
Total outcomes = (6 + 3 - 1)! / (6! × (3 - 1)!)
Total outcomes = 8! / (6! × 2!)
Total outcomes = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 / (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 × 2 × 1)
Total outcomes = 28

Now, we need to count the number of outcomes for each case.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
To get this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 balls, then 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls, and the remaining 2 balls will go to C.
Number of outcomes for case 1 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) = 15 × 6 = 90

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
To get this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 balls, then 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C.
Number of outcomes for case 2 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) = 15 × 4 = 60

Since the number of outcomes for case 1 (90) is greater than the number of outcomes for case 2 (60), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
