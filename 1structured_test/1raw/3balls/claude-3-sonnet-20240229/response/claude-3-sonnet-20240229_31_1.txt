To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

To calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case, we can use the combination formula:
nCr = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)
where n is the total number of objects, and r is the number of objects chosen.

For Case 1:
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to assign the remaining 2 balls to C: 1 (no choice)
Total number of outcomes for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

For Case 2:
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A: 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls: 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to assign the remaining 1 ball to C: 1 (no choice)
Total number of outcomes for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since there are more outcomes for Case 1 (90) than for Case 2 (60), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
