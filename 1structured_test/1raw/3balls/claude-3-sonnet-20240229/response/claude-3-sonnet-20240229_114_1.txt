To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- There are 3 children: A, B, and C.
- In case 1, the distribution is A:2, B:2, C:2.
- In case 2, the distribution is A:2, B:3, C:1.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ways case 1 can occur.
To distribute 6 balls among 3 children such that each child gets 2 balls, we need to choose 2 balls for the first child, then 2 balls from the remaining 4 balls for the second child, and the remaining 2 balls for the third child.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 balls = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways for case 1 = 15 × 6 = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways case 2 can occur.
To distribute 6 balls among 3 children such that one child gets 3 balls and the other two children get 2 and 1 ball, respectively, we need to choose 3 balls for the first child, then 2 balls from the remaining 3 balls for the second child, and the remaining 1 ball for the third child.
Number of ways to choose 3 balls from 6 balls = 6C3 = 20
Number of ways to choose 2 balls from the remaining 3 balls = 3C2 = 3
Number of ways for case 2 = 20 × 3 = 60

Step 3: Compare the number of ways for case 1 and case 2.
Case 1 has 90 ways, while case 2 has 60 ways.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
