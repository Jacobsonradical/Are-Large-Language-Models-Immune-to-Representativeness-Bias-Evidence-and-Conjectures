To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Find the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among three children.
Total number of ways = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Find the number of ways for Case 1 to occur.
For Case 1, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C.
Number of ways for Case 1 = (6 × 5) / (2! × 2!) × (4 × 3) / (2! × 2!) × 2! = 90

Step 3: Find the number of ways for Case 2 to occur.
For Case 2, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C.
Number of ways for Case 2 = (6 × 5) / (2! × 4!) × (4 × 3 × 2) / (3! × 1!) × 1! = 120

Step 4: Compare the number of ways for each case.
Number of ways for Case 1 = 90
Number of ways for Case 2 = 120

Since the number of ways for Case 2 is greater than the number of ways for Case 1, Case 2 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
