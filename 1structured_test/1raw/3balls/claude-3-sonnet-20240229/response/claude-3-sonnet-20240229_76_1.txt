To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children for each case and compare their probabilities.

Given information:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children.
Total number of ways = 6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90
(This is a combination problem, where we choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C)

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to get Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2).
Number of ways for Case 1 = 6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to get Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1).
Number of ways for Case 2 = 6! / (2! × 3! × 1!) = 30

Step 4: Calculate the probabilities of each case.
Probability of Case 1 = Number of ways for Case 1 / Total number of ways = 90 / 90 = 1
Probability of Case 2 = Number of ways for Case 2 / Total number of ways = 30 / 90 = 1/3

Since the probability of Case 1 is higher than the probability of Case 2, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
