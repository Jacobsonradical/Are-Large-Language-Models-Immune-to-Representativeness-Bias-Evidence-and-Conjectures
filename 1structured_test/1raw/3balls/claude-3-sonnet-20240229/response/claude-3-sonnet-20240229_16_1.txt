To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To get this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls in such a way that each child gets 2 balls.
The total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, with repetition allowed, is given by the combination formula:
C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 8!/(2!×6!) = 28

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To get this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls in such a way that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls for A is C(6, 2) = 15
The number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls is C(4, 3) = 4
The remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Therefore, the total number of ways to get this case is 15 × 4 = 60

Comparing the two cases:
Case 1 has 28 possible outcomes.
Case 2 has 60 possible outcomes.

Since case 2 has more possible outcomes than case 1, it is more likely to occur in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
