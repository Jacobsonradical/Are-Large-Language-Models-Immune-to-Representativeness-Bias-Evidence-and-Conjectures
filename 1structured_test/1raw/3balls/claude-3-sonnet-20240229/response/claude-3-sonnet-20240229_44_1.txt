To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children.
Total number of ways = Combinations of 6 objects taken 3 at a time = C(6, 3) = 6!/(3!×3!) = 20

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways for Case 1 to occur.
In Case 1, each child gets 2 balls.
Number of ways for Case 1 = Combinations of 6 objects taken 2 at a time for each child = C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways for Case 2 to occur.
In Case 2, one child gets 3 balls, and the other two children get 2 and 1 ball, respectively.
Number of ways for Case 2 = Combinations of 6 objects taken 3 at a time × Combinations of 3 objects taken 2 at a time × Combinations of 3 objects taken 1 at a time = C(6, 3) × C(3, 2) × C(3, 1) = 20 × 3 × 3 = 180

Step 4: Compare the number of ways for each case.
Case 1: 90 ways
Case 2: 180 ways

Since Case 2 has more ways to occur than Case 1, it will happen more often in many rounds of the game.

Answer: {case: 2}
