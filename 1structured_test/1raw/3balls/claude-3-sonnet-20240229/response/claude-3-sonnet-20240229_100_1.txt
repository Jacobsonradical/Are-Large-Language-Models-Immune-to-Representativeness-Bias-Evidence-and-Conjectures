To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

Given information:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Find the total number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children.
Total number of ways = 6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90
(This is a combination problem, where we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and 2 balls for C from the set of 6 balls.)

Step 2: Find the number of ways Case 1 can occur.
Number of ways for Case 1 = 6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90 / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 15

Step 3: Find the number of ways Case 2 can occur.
Number of ways for Case 2 = 6! / (2! × 3! × 1!) = 90 / (2 × 6) = 15

Since both cases have an equal number of ways to occur (15 out of 90), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, the results of Case 1 and Case 2 will occur with equal probability.
