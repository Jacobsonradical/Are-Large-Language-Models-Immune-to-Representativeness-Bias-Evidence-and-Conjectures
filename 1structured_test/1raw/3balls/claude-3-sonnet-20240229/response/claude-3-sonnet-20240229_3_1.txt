To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of possible ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children, and then determine how many of those ways correspond to case 1 and case 2.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 distinguishable boxes (children) is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 + 3 - 1)! / (6! * (3 - 1)!) = 28

Now, let's count the number of ways for each case:

Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2):
There is only one way to distribute the balls in this manner: 2 balls to each child.

Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1):
There are 3 ways to distribute the balls in this manner, corresponding to the 3 choices for the child who gets 3 balls.

Therefore, there are more results of case 2 than case 1.

{case: 2}
