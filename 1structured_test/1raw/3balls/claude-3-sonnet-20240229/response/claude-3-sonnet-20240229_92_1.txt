To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children.
Total number of ways = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways for Case 1 to occur.
Number of ways for A to get 2 balls = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways for B to get 2 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways for C to get 2 balls = 2C2 = 1
Number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways for Case 2 to occur.
Number of ways for A to get 2 balls = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways for B to get 3 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways for C to get 1 ball = 2C1 = 2
Number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 2 = 120

Step 4: Compare the number of ways for each case.
Number of ways for Case 1 = 90
Number of ways for Case 2 = 120

Since the number of ways for Case 2 (120) is greater than the number of ways for Case 1 (90), there will be more results of Case 2 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
