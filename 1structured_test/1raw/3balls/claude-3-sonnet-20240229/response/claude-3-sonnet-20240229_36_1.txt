To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children for each case and then compare the results.

Given information:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- There are three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = (6 choose 2) = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = (4 choose 2) = 6
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for C from the remaining 2 balls = (2 choose 2) = 1
Total number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = (6 choose 2) = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = (4 choose 3) = 4
Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C from the remaining 1 ball = (1 choose 1) = 1
Total number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 3: Compare the results for Case 1 and Case 2.
Case 1 has 90 possible ways, and Case 2 has 60 possible ways.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Answer: {case: 1}
