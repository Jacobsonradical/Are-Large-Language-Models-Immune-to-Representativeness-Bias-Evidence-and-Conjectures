To find the answer, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children.
Total number of ways = 6! (factorial) = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways for Case 1 to occur.
Number of ways for Case 1 = Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A × Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B × Number of ways to choose 2 balls for C
Number of ways for Case 1 = (6C2) × (4C2) × (2C2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways for Case 2 to occur.
Number of ways for Case 2 = Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A × Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B × Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C
Number of ways for Case 2 = (6C2) × (6C3) × (6C1) = 15 × 20 × 6 = 1800

Step 4: Compare the number of ways for each case.
Number of ways for Case 1 = 90
Number of ways for Case 2 = 1800

Since the number of ways for Case 2 is greater than the number of ways for Case 1, Case 2 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
