To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children (A, B, and C) for each case and then compare the results.

Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2):
In this case, we have 6 balls, and we want to distribute them such that each child gets 2 balls.
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children, where each child gets 2 balls, is given by the combination formula:

Number of ways = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1):
In this case, we have 6 balls, and we want to distribute them such that A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children with the given distribution is given by the combination formula:

Number of ways = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) × (1 choose 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Comparing the two cases, we can see that case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has more outcomes (90) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) with 60 outcomes.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
