To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to obtain each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Find the number of ways to obtain Case 1.
To get Case 1, we need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 balls, then 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls, and the remaining 2 balls go to C.
Number of ways to obtain Case 1 = (6C2) × (4C2) = 15 × 6 = 90

Step 2: Find the number of ways to obtain Case 2.
To get Case 2, we need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 balls, then 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Number of ways to obtain Case 2 = (6C2) × (4C3) = 15 × 4 = 60

Step 3: Compare the number of ways for Case 1 and Case 2.
Since the number of ways to obtain Case 1 (90) is greater than the number of ways to obtain Case 2 (60), there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
