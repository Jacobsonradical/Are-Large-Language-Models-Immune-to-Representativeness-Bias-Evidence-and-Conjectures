To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and then compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible distributions.
Total number of distributions = Number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children
                              = 6! (factorial of 6)
                              = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1
                              = 720

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways Case 1 can occur.
For Case 1, we need to select 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and 2 balls for C.
Number of ways to select 2 balls from 6 balls = 6C2 = 6! / (2! × 4!)
                                              = 15
Since there are 3 children, we need to consider the order in which the groups of 2 balls are assigned.
Number of ways Case 1 can occur = 15 × 3! (permutations of 3 children)
                                 = 15 × 6
                                 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways Case 2 can occur.
For Case 2, we need to select 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C.
Number of ways to select 2 balls from 6 balls = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to select 3 balls from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to select 1 ball from the remaining 1 ball = 1
Number of ways Case 2 can occur = 15 × 4 × 1 × 3! (permutations of 3 children)
                                 = 360

Step 4: Compare the number of ways each case can occur.
Number of ways Case 1 can occur = 90
Number of ways Case 2 can occur = 360

Since there are more ways for Case 2 to occur than Case 1, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2.

Therefore, the answer in the specified format is:
{case: 2}
