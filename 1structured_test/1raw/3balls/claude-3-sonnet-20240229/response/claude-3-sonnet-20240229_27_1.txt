To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes and then determine how many of those outcomes correspond to case 1 and case 2.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed among three children: A, B, and C.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes.
The total number of possible outcomes is given by the combination formula:
Total outcomes = C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 8! / (2! × 6!) = 28

Step 2: Calculate the number of outcomes for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
In this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C.
Number of outcomes for case 1 = C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of outcomes for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
In this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C.
Number of outcomes for case 2 = C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Compare the number of outcomes for case 1 and case 2.
Since the number of outcomes for case 1 (90) is greater than the number of outcomes for case 2 (60), there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
