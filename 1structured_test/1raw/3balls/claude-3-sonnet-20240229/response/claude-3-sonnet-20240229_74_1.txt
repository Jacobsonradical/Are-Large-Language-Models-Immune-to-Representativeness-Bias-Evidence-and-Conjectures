To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible distributions.
Total number of distributions = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of distributions for Case 1.
Number of distributions for Case 1 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of distributions for Case 2.
Number of distributions for Case 2 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) × (2 choose 1) = 15 × 4 × 2 = 120

Step 4: Compare the number of distributions for each case.
Since the number of distributions for Case 2 (120) is greater than the number of distributions for Case 1 (90), Case 2 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
