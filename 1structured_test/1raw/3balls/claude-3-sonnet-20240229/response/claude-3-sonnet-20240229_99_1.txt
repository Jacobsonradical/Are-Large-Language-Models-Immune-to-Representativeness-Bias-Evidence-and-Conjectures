To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children.
Total number of ways = 6! (permutations of 6 balls)

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways for Case 1 to occur.
For Case 1, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C.
Number of ways for Case 1 = (6C2) × (4C2) × (2C2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways for Case 2 to occur.
For Case 2, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C.
Number of ways for Case 2 = (6C2) × (4C3) × (1C1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Compare the number of ways for each case.
Case 1 has 90 ways, and Case 2 has 60 ways.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
