To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes for each case.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Total number of possible outcomes:
The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children is given by the combination formula:
Total outcomes = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To calculate the number of favorable outcomes for case 1, we need to choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls, then 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls, and the remaining 2 balls go to C.
Favorable outcomes for case 1 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) = (6! / (2! × 4!)) × (4! / (2! × 2!)) = 15 × 6 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To calculate the number of favorable outcomes for case 2, we need to choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls, then 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Favorable outcomes for case 2 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) = (6! / (2! × 4!)) × (4! / (1! × 3!)) = 15 × 4 = 60

Comparing the favorable outcomes:
Favorable outcomes for case 1 (90) > Favorable outcomes for case 2 (60)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
