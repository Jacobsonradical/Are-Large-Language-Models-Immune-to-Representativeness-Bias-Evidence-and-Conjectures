To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Total number of possible outcomes = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To obtain this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for C from the remaining 2 balls = 2C2 = 1
Total number of outcomes for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To obtain this case, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C from the remaining 1 ball = 1C1 = 1
Total number of outcomes for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Comparison:
Number of outcomes for Case 1 = 90
Number of outcomes for Case 2 = 60

Since the number of outcomes for Case 1 is greater than the number of outcomes for Case 2, Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
