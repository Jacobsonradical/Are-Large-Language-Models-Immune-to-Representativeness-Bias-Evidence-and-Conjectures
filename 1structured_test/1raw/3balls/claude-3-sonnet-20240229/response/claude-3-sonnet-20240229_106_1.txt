To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, A, B, and C, for each case and compare the results.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- There are three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
To calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case, we use the combination formula:
Number of ways = (Total number of balls)! / [(Number of balls for A)! × (Number of balls for B)! × (Number of balls for C)!]
Number of ways = 6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 15

Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
Similarly, we use the combination formula:
Number of ways = 6! / (2! × 3! × 1!) = 30

Since there are more ways to distribute the balls in Case 2 (30 ways) than in Case 1 (15 ways), Case 2 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
