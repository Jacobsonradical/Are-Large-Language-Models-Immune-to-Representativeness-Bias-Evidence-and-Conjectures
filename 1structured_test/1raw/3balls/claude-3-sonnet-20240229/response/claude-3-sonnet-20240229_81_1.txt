To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible distributions.
Total number of distributions = 6C2 × 4C2 × 2C2 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90
(6C2 represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A, 4C2 represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B, and 2C2 represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 2 balls for child C.)

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways case 1 can occur.
Number of ways for case 1 = 6C2 × 4C2 × 2C2 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways case 2 can occur.
Number of ways for case 2 = 6C2 × 4C3 × 2C1 = 15 × 4 × 2 = 120

Step 4: Compare the number of ways for each case.
Case 1: 90 ways
Case 2: 120 ways

Therefore, case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1) will occur more often than case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2) in many rounds of the game.
