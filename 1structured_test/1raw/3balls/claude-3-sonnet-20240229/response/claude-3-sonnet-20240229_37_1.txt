To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To obtain this distribution, we can first choose 2 balls for child A from the 6 balls. This can be done in (6 choose 2) = 15 ways.
Next, we can choose 2 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls, which can be done in (4 choose 2) = 6 ways.
The remaining 2 balls automatically go to child C.
Therefore, the total number of ways to obtain case 1 is 15 × 6 = 90.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To obtain this distribution, we can first choose 2 balls for child A from the 6 balls, which can be done in (6 choose 2) = 15 ways.
Next, we can choose 3 balls for child B from the remaining 4 balls, which can be done in (4 choose 3) = 4 ways.
The remaining ball automatically goes to child C.
Therefore, the total number of ways to obtain case 2 is 15 × 4 = 60.

Since there are more ways to obtain case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways), case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
