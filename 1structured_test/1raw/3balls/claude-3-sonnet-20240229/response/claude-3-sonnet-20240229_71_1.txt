To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, A, B, and C, for each case, and then compare their probabilities.

Given:
- Total number of balls = 6
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children.
Total number of ways = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for C from the remaining 2 balls = 2C2 = 1
Total number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C from the remaining 1 ball = 1C1 = 1
Total number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Calculate the probabilities for each case.
Probability of Case 1 = Number of ways for Case 1 / Total number of ways
Probability of Case 1 = 90 / 720 = 0.125 or 1/8

Probability of Case 2 = Number of ways for Case 2 / Total number of ways
Probability of Case 2 = 60 / 720 = 0.083 or 1/12

Since the probability of Case 1 (1/8) is greater than the probability of Case 2 (1/12), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
