To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, A, B, and C, for each case, and then compare the probabilities.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child receives 2 balls. The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 distinguishable balls for the first child (A) is: 6C2 = 15
For the second child (B), there are 4 remaining balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 balls is: 4C2 = 6
For the third child (C), there are 2 remaining balls, so there is only 1 way to distribute the remaining 2 balls.
Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 is: 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, A receives 2 balls, B receives 3 balls, and C receives 1 ball.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls from 6 distinguishable balls for A is: 6C2 = 15
The number of ways to choose 3 balls from the remaining 4 balls for B is: 4C3 = 4
The number of ways to choose the remaining 1 ball for C is: 1
Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 2 is: 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since the total number of ways to distribute the balls in case 1 (90) is greater than the total number of ways in case 2 (60), case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
