To determine which case occurs more often, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur, and then compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To get this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls into three groups of 2 balls each. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To get this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls into two groups of 2 balls and one group of 2 balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Comparing the results:
The number of ways for Case 1 (90) is greater than the number of ways for Case 2 (60).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
