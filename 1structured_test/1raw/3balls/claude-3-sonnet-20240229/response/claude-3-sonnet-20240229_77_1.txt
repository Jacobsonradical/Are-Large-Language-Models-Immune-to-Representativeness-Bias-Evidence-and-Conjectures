To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes and then determine how many of those outcomes correspond to case 1 and case 2.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

The total number of possible outcomes can be calculated using combination formulas.

Total number of outcomes = C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Here's the reasoning:
- We first choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. There are C(6, 2) = 15 ways to do this.
- Then, we choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. There are C(4, 2) = 6 ways to do this.
- Finally, the remaining 2 balls go to child C. There is only 1 way to do this.

Now, let's count the number of outcomes for case 1 and case 2.

Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2):
There is only one way to distribute the balls such that each child gets 2 balls.

Number of outcomes for case 1 = 1

Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1):
- First, we choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A. There are C(6, 2) = 15 ways to do this.
- Then, we choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B. There are C(4, 3) = 4 ways to do this.
- The remaining 1 ball goes to child C.

Number of outcomes for case 2 = 15 × 4 = 60

Therefore, there will be more results of case 2 than case 1.

{case: 2}
