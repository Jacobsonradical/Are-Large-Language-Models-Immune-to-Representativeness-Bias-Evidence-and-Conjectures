To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A: 2, B: 2, C: 2
To get this case, we need to select 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C.
The number of ways to select 2 balls out of 6 for A is: C(6, 2) = 6!/(2!×4!) = 15
Similarly, the number of ways to select 2 balls for B and C is also 15.
Therefore, the total number of ways to get Case 1 is: 15 × 15 × 15 = 3,375

Case 2: A: 2, B: 3, C: 1
To get this case, we need to select 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C.
The number of ways to select 2 balls out of 6 for A is: C(6, 2) = 15
The number of ways to select 3 balls out of the remaining 4 for B is: C(4, 3) = 4
The remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Therefore, the total number of ways to get Case 2 is: 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Comparing the two cases:
Case 1 has 3,375 ways, while Case 2 has 60 ways.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2) than Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1).
