To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child gets 2 balls.
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls, is given by the combination formula:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, one child gets 2 balls, another gets 3 balls, and the third gets 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children, with one child getting 2 balls, another getting 3 balls, and the third getting 1 ball, is given by:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since case 1 has 90 possible outcomes, and case 2 has 60 possible outcomes, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
