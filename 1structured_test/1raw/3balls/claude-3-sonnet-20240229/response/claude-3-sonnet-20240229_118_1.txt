To determine which case will occur more often, we need to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Total number of possible outcomes = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To obtain this case, we need to select 2 balls for A out of 6 balls, then 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls, and the remaining 2 balls go to C.
Number of outcomes for Case 1 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To obtain this case, we need to select 2 balls for A out of 6 balls, then 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Number of outcomes for Case 2 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) × 1 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since the number of outcomes for Case 1 (90) is greater than the number of outcomes for Case 2 (60), Case 1 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.
