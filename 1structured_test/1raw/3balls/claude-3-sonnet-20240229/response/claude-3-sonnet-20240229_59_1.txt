To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To get this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls into three groups of 2 balls each.
The number of ways to do this is: Combination(6, 2) × Combination(4, 2) × Combination(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To get this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls into groups of 2, 3, and 1 ball.
The number of ways to do this is: Combination(6, 2) × Combination(4, 3) × Combination(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since there are 90 ways to get Case 1 and 60 ways to get Case 2, Case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.
