To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

To calculate the number of ways each case can occur, we can use the combination formula:

nCr = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)

Where:
- n is the total number of objects (balls)
- r is the number of objects (balls) in the desired group
- nCr represents the number of combinations of r objects chosen from n objects

For Case 1:
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to assign the remaining 2 balls to C = 1 (no choice)
Total number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

For Case 2:
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to assign the remaining 1 ball to C = 1 (no choice)
Total number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since there are more ways for Case 1 (90) to occur than Case 2 (60), Case 1 will be more frequent in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
