To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children for each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, where each child gets 2 balls, is given by the combination formula:

Number of ways = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2)
             = (6! / (2! × 4!)) × (4! / (2! × 2!)) × (2! / (2! × 0!))
             = 15 × 6 × 1
             = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, is given by the combination formula:

Number of ways = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) × (1 choose 1)
             = (6! / (2! × 4!)) × (4! / (3! × 1!)) × (1! / (1! × 0!))
             = 15 × 4 × 1
             = 60

Comparing the two cases:
Case 1 has 90 possible outcomes, while Case 2 has 60 possible outcomes.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
