To find the number of possible outcomes for each case, we need to calculate the combinations of distributing 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children.

The total number of possible outcomes is given by the multinomial coefficient:

(6 + 3 - 1)! / (6! * (3 - 1)!) = 28

For case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2), the number of outcomes is:
6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 15

For case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1), the number of outcomes is:
6! / (2! * 3! * 1!) = 10

Since there are more outcomes for case 1 (15) than case 2 (10), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.
