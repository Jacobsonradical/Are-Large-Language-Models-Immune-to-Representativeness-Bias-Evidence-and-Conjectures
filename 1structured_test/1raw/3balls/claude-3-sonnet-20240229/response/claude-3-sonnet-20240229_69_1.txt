To determine which case will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children.
Total number of ways = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to get Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
Number of ways for A to get 2 balls = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways for B to get 2 balls from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways for C to get the remaining 2 balls = 1
Number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to get Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
Number of ways for A to get 2 balls = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways for B to get 3 balls from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways for C to get the remaining 1 ball = 1
Number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Calculate the probability of each case occurring.
Probability of Case 1 = Number of ways for Case 1 / Total number of ways
                     = 90 / 720
                     = 0.125 or 12.5%

Probability of Case 2 = Number of ways for Case 2 / Total number of ways
                     = 60 / 720
                     = 0.083 or 8.3%

Since the probability of Case 1 (12.5%) is higher than the probability of Case 2 (8.3%), in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
