To determine which case will occur more frequently, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A: 2, B: 2, C: 2
To get this distribution, we need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 balls, then choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls, and the remaining 2 balls will go to C.

Number of ways to get Case 1 = (6C2) × (4C2) = 15 × 6 = 90

Case 2: A: 2, B: 3, C: 1
To get this distribution, we need to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 balls, then choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls, and the remaining 1 ball will go to C.

Number of ways to get Case 2 = (6C2) × (4C3) = 15 × 4 = 60

Since the total number of possible distributions is (6C2) × (4C2) + (6C2) × (4C3) = 90 + 60 = 150, the probability of getting Case 1 is 90/150 = 0.6, and the probability of getting Case 2 is 60/150 = 0.4.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, Case 1 will occur more frequently than Case 2.
