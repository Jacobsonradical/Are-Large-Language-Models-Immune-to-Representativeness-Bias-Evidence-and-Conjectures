To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children for each case, and then compare their probabilities.

Given information:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible ways to distribute 6 balls among three children.
Total number of ways = Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A × Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B × Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C
Total number of ways = (6C2) × (4C3) × (1C1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
Number of ways for Case 1 = (6C2) × (4C2) × (2C2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
Number of ways for Case 2 = (6C2) × (4C3) × (1C1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Calculate the probabilities for each case.
Probability of Case 1 = Number of ways for Case 1 / Total number of ways = 90 / 60 = 1.5
Probability of Case 2 = Number of ways for Case 2 / Total number of ways = 60 / 60 = 1

Since the probability of Case 1 is greater than the probability of Case 2, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
