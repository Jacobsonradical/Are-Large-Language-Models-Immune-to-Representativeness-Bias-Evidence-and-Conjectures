To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the number of possible outcomes for Case 1.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 balls for A is: C(6, 2) = 6!/(2!×4!) = 15
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for B is: C(4, 2) = 4!/(2!×2!) = 6
The remaining 2 balls go to C.
Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for Case 1 = 15 × 6 = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of possible outcomes for Case 2.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 balls for A is: C(6, 2) = 6!/(2!×4!) = 15
The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for B is: C(4, 3) = 4!/(3!×1!) = 4
The remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for Case 2 = 15 × 4 = 60

Step 3: Compare the number of possible outcomes for Case 1 and Case 2.
Case 1 has 90 possible outcomes, while Case 2 has 60 possible outcomes.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
