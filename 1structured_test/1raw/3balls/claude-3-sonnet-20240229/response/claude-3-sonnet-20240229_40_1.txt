To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child receives 2 balls. We can calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, where each child gets 2 balls, using the combination formula:

Number of ways for Case 1 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, one child gets 3 balls, and the other two children get 2 and 1 ball, respectively. We can calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, where one child gets 3 balls, using the combination formula:

Number of ways for Case 2 = (6 choose 3) × (3 choose 2) × (3 choose 1) = 20 × 3 × 3 = 180

Since the number of ways for Case 2 (180) is greater than the number of ways for Case 1 (90), Case 2 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2}
