To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes and then determine how many of those outcomes correspond to case 1 and case 2.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes.
Total number of possible outcomes = Number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable objects among 3 groups
= (6 × 5 × 4) / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90
(This is a combination problem, and we divide by the factorials to account for the indistinguishability within each group.)

Step 2: Calculate the number of outcomes for case 1.
For case 1, each child gets 2 balls.
Number of outcomes for case 1 = (6 × 5 × 4) / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of outcomes for case 2.
For case 2, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C = 1 (only one way)
Number of outcomes for case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Compare the number of outcomes for case 1 and case 2.
Number of outcomes for case 1 = 90
Number of outcomes for case 2 = 60

Since the number of outcomes for case 1 is greater than the number of outcomes for case 2, there will be more results of case 1 in many rounds of the game.
