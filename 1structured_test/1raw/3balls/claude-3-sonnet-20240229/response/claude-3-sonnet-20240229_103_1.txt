To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child gets 2 balls.
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, with each child getting 2 balls, is given by the combination formula:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball.
The number of ways to distribute 6 balls among 3 children, with A getting 2 balls, B getting 3 balls, and C getting 1 ball, is given by the combination formula:
C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) × C(1, 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Comparing the number of possible outcomes:
Case 1: 90 outcomes
Case 2: 60 outcomes

Since there are more possible outcomes for Case 1, we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.
