To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To get this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls into three groups of 2 balls each. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

Number of ways for Case 1 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
To get this case, we need to distribute the 6 balls into one group of 3 balls and two groups of 2 balls each. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:

Number of ways for Case 2 = (6 choose 3) × (3 choose 2) × (3 choose 1) = 20 × 3 × 3 = 180

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we can see that Case 2 has more possibilities than Case 1.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2}
