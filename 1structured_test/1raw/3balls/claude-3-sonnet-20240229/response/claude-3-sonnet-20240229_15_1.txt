To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, A, B, and C, and then determine how many of those distributions correspond to case 1 and case 2.

The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children is given by the combination formula:

Total number of distributions = C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 28

Here's how we can calculate the number of distributions for each case:

Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2):
To get this distribution, we need to select 2 balls for A out of 6 balls, then 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls, and the remaining 2 balls go to C. The number of ways to do this is:

C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) = 15 × 6 = 90

Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1):
To get this distribution, we need to select 2 balls for A out of 6 balls, then 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C. The number of ways to do this is:

C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) = 15 × 4 = 60

Since there are more distributions corresponding to case 1 (90) than case 2 (60), we can conclude that in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{case: 1}
