To determine whether case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) or case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game, we need to calculate the probability of each case.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible distributions.
Total number of distributions = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Calculate the number of favorable cases for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for C from the remaining 2 balls = 2C2 = 1
Number of favorable cases for case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of favorable cases for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C from the remaining 1 ball = 1C1 = 1
Number of favorable cases for case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Calculate the probability of each case.
Probability of case 1 = Number of favorable cases for case 1 / Total number of distributions
                    = 90 / 720
                    = 0.125 or 1/8

Probability of case 2 = Number of favorable cases for case 2 / Total number of distributions
                    = 60 / 720
                    = 0.083 or 5/60

Since the probability of case 1 (0.125 or 1/8) is greater than the probability of case 2 (0.083 or 5/60), case 1 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
