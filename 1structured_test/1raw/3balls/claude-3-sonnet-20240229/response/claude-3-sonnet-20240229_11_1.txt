To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes and then find the number of outcomes corresponding to each case.

Given information:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes.
Total number of outcomes = Number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children
Total number of outcomes = (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of outcomes for Case 1.
In Case 1, each child gets 2 balls.
Number of outcomes for Case 1 = Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A × Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B × Number of ways to choose 2 balls for C
Number of outcomes for Case 1 = (6C2) × (4C2) × (2C2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of outcomes for Case 2.
In Case 2, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.
Number of outcomes for Case 2 = Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A × Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B × Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C
Number of outcomes for Case 2 = (6C2) × (4C3) × (2C1) = 15 × 4 × 2 = 120

Step 4: Compare the number of outcomes for each case.
Since the number of outcomes for Case 2 (120) is greater than the number of outcomes for Case 1 (90), Case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
