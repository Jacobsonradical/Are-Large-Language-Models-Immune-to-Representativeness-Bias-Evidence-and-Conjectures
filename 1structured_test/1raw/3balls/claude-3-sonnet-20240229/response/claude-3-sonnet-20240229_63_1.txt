To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children for each case and then compare the results.

Given information:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
Number of ways = Combinations of 6 balls taken 2 at a time × Combinations of remaining 4 balls taken 2 at a time × Combinations of remaining 2 balls taken 2 at a time
Number of ways = (6C2) × (4C2) × (2C2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to distribute 6 balls for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).
Number of ways = Combinations of 6 balls taken 2 at a time × Combinations of remaining 4 balls taken 3 at a time × Combinations of remaining 1 ball taken 1 at a time
Number of ways = (6C2) × (4C3) × (1C1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 3: Compare the results.
Since the number of ways for Case 1 (90) is greater than the number of ways for Case 2 (60), there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
