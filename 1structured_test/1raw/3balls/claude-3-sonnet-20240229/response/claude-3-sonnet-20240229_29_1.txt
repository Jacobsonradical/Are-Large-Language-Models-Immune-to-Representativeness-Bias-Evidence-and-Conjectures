To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children A, B, and C, for each case, and then compare the results.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2 (each child gets 2 balls)
- Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1 (one child gets 3 balls, and the other two children get 2 and 1 ball, respectively)

Step 1: Calculate the number of possible ways for Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2)
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 balls = Combination(6, 2) = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls = Combination(4, 2) = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for C out of the remaining 2 balls = Combination(2, 2) = 2C2 = 1
Total number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of possible ways for Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1)
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A out of 6 balls = Combination(6, 2) = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B out of the remaining 4 balls = Combination(4, 3) = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C out of the remaining 1 ball = 1
Total number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 3: Compare the results
Case 1 has 90 possible ways, and Case 2 has 60 possible ways.

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2.

Answer: {case: 1}
