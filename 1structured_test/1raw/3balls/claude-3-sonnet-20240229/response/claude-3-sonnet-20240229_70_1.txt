To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the 6 balls among the three children for each case and then compare them.

Given information:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
To find the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case, we can use combinations.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls = C(6, 2) = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = C(4, 2) = 6
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for C from the remaining 2 balls = C(2, 2) = 1
Total number of ways = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
Similarly, we can find the number of ways to distribute the balls in this case.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls = C(6, 2) = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = C(4, 3) = 4
Number of ways to choose 1 ball for C from the remaining 1 ball = C(1, 1) = 1
Total number of ways = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Comparing the two cases, we can see that Case 1 has more outcomes (90) than Case 2 (60).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
