To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to obtain each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

To calculate the number of ways to obtain each case, we can use combinations.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
- We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, which can be done in 6C2 = 15 ways.
- For B, we need to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls, which can be done in 4C2 = 6 ways.
- For C, there are no choices left since the remaining 2 balls must go to C.
- The total number of ways to obtain case 1 = 15 × 6 = 90.

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
- We need to choose 2 balls out of 6 for A, which can be done in 6C2 = 15 ways.
- For B, we need to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls, which can be done in 4C3 = 4 ways.
- For C, there is only 1 ball left, which has no choices.
- The total number of ways to obtain case 2 = 15 × 4 = 60.

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we can see that there are more ways to obtain case 1 (90 ways) than case 2 (60 ways).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
