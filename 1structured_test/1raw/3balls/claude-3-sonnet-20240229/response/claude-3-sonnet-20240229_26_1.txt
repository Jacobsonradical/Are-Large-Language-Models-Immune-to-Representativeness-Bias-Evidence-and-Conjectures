To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes and then determine how many of those outcomes correspond to case 1 and case 2.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed among three children: A, B, and C.
- In case 1, the distribution is A: 2, B: 2, C: 2.
- In case 2, the distribution is A: 2, B: 3, C: 1.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes.
The total number of possible outcomes is given by the combination formula:
Total outcomes = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

This represents the number of ways to distribute 2 balls to A, 2 balls to B, and 2 balls to C.

Step 2: Calculate the number of outcomes for case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2).
Since the balls are distinguishable, and the children are distinct, there is only one way to distribute the balls in case 1.
Number of outcomes for case 1 = 1

Step 3: Calculate the number of outcomes for case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1).
For case 2, there are (6 choose 2) ways to choose 2 balls for A, (4 choose 3) ways to choose 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to C.
Number of outcomes for case 2 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) = 15 × 4 = 60

Step 4: Compare the number of outcomes for case 1 and case 2.
Since the number of outcomes for case 2 (60) is greater than the number of outcomes for case 1 (1), case 2 will occur more often in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 2}
