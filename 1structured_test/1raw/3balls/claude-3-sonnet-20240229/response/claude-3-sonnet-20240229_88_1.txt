To solve this problem, we need to find the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children (A, B, and C) for each case and compare their relative probabilities.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, we have a combination of (2, 2, 2) for the distribution of balls among A, B, and C.
The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into three groups of 2 each is:
6! / (2! × 2! × 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, we have a combination of (2, 3, 1) for the distribution of balls among A, B, and C.
The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls into groups of 2, 3, and 1 is:
6! / (2! × 3! × 1!) = 180

Since there are more possible arrangements for Case 2 (180) than for Case 1 (90), Case 2 will occur more frequently in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2}
