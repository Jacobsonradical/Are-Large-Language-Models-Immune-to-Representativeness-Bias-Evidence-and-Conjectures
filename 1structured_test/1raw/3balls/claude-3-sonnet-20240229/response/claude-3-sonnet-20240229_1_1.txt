To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, A, B, and C, for each case.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, where each child gets 2 balls, is given by the combination formula:

6C2 × 4C2 × 2C2 = (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (2! × 2! × 2! × 2! × 2! × 2!) = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, where A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball, is given by the combination formula:

6C2 × 4C3 × 1C1 = (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (2! × 3! × 1!) = 120

Therefore, there are more possible distributions for case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than for case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
