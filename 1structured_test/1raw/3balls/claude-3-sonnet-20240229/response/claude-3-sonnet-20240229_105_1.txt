To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed at random among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible distributions.
Total number of distributions = 6! (permutations of 6 balls)
Total number of distributions = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways Case 1 can occur.
For Case 1, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C.
Number of ways for Case 1 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2)
Number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways Case 2 can occur.
For Case 2, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C.
Number of ways for Case 2 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) × (1 choose 1)
Number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Compare the number of ways for each case.
Number of ways for Case 1 (90) > Number of ways for Case 2 (60)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Answer: {case: 1}
