To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes and then determine how many of those outcomes correspond to case 1 and case 2.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed among three children: A, B, and C.

The total number of possible outcomes can be calculated using the combination formula:

Total number of outcomes = C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Here's the explanation:
- C(6, 2) represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A.
- C(4, 2) represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B.
- C(2, 2) represents the number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 2 balls for child C.

Now, let's count the number of outcomes for each case:

Case 1 (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2):
There is only one way to distribute the balls with each child getting 2 balls.

Case 2 (A: 2, B: 3, C: 1):
There are 6 ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A.
There are 4 ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B.
There is 1 way to choose the remaining ball for child C.
Total number of outcomes for case 2 = 6 × 4 × 1 = 24

Therefore, there are more outcomes corresponding to case 2 than case 1.
