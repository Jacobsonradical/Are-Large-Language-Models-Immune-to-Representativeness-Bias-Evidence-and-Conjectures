To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children, A, B, and C, for each case, and then compare the results.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls for Case 1.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to assign the remaining 2 balls to C = 1 (no choice)
Total number of ways for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the balls for Case 2.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to assign the remaining 1 ball to C = 1 (no choice)
Total number of ways for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since there are 90 possible outcomes for Case 1 and 60 possible outcomes for Case 2, there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.
