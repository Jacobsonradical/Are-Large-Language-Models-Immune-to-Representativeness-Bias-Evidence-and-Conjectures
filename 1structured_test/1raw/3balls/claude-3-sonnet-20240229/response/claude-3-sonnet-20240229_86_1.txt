To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible arrangements for each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the number of possible arrangements for Case 1.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C2 = 6
Number of ways to assign the remaining 2 balls to C = 1
Total number of arrangements for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of possible arrangements for Case 2.
Number of ways to choose 2 balls for A from 6 balls = 6C2 = 15
Number of ways to choose 3 balls for B from the remaining 4 balls = 4C3 = 4
Number of ways to assign the remaining 1 ball to C = 1
Total number of arrangements for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Since the total number of arrangements for Case 1 (90) is greater than the total number of arrangements for Case 2 (60), there will be more results of Case 1 in many rounds of the game.

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
