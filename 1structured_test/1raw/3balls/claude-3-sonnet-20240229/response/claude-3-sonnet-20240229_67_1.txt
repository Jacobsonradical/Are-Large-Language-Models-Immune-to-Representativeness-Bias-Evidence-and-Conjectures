To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Find the total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children.
Total number of ways = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Find the number of ways for Case 1 to occur.
For Case 1, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 2 balls for B, and the remaining 2 balls for C.
Number of ways for Case 1 = (6C2) × (4C2) × (2C2) = (15 × 6 × 1) = 90

Step 3: Find the number of ways for Case 2 to occur.
For Case 2, we need to choose 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and the remaining 1 ball for C.
Number of ways for Case 2 = (6C2) × (4C3) × (1C1) = (15 × 4 × 1) = 60

Step 4: Compare the number of ways for each case.
Number of ways for Case 1 (90) > Number of ways for Case 2 (60)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Answer: {case: 1}
