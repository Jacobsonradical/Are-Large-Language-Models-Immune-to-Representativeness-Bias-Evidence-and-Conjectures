To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls.
To calculate the number of ways this can occur, we need to consider the combinations of selecting 2 balls for each child from the total of 6 balls.

Number of ways for Case 1 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball.
To calculate the number of ways this can occur, we need to consider the combinations of selecting 2 balls for A, 3 balls for B, and 1 ball for C from the total of 6 balls.

Number of ways for Case 2 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) × (1 choose 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Comparing the number of ways for each case, we can see that Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2) has more possible outcomes than Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
