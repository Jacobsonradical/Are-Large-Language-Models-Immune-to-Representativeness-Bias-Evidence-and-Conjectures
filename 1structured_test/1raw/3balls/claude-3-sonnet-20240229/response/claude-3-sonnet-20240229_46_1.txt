To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes and then determine how many of those outcomes correspond to case 1 and case 2.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes.
The total number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among three children is given by the combination formula:
Total outcomes = C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 8!/(2!×6!) = 28

Step 2: Calculate the number of outcomes for case 1.
In case 1, each child gets 2 balls. There are C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(4, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for child B, and the remaining 2 balls go to child C.
Number of outcomes for case 1 = C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) = 15 × 6 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of outcomes for case 2.
In case 2, child A gets 2 balls, child B gets 3 balls, and child C gets 1 ball. There are C(6, 2) ways to choose 2 balls for child A, C(4, 3) ways to choose 3 balls for child B, and the remaining 1 ball goes to child C.
Number of outcomes for case 2 = C(6, 2) × C(4, 3) = 15 × 4 = 60

Step 4: Compare the number of outcomes for case 1 and case 2.
Number of outcomes for case 1 (90) > Number of outcomes for case 2 (60)

Therefore, in many rounds of the game, there will be more results of case 1 than case 2.
