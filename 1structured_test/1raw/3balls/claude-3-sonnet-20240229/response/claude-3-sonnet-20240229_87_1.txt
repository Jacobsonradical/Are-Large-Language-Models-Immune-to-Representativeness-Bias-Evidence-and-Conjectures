To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A:2, B:2, C:2
In this case, each child gets 2 balls. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children, where each child gets 2 balls, is given by the combination formula:

Number of ways for Case 1 = C(6, 2) × C(4, 2) × C(2, 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Case 2: A:2, B:3, C:1
In this case, one child gets 3 balls, and the other two children get 2 and 1 ball, respectively. The number of ways to distribute 6 distinguishable balls among 3 children, where one child gets 3 balls, and the other two get 2 and 1 ball, respectively, is given by:

Number of ways for Case 2 = C(6, 3) × C(3, 2) × C(3, 1) = 20 × 3 × 3 = 180

Comparing the two cases, we can see that Case 2 has more possible outcomes than Case 1 (180 > 90).

Therefore, the answer is:

{case: 2}

In many rounds of the game, there will be more results of Case 2 (A:2, B:3, C:1) than Case 1 (A:2, B:2, C:2).
