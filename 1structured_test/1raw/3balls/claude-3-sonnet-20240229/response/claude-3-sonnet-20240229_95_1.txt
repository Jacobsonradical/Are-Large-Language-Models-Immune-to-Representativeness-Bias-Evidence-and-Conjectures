To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of possible outcomes for each case and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed among three children: A, B, and C.
- Case 1: A gets 2 balls, B gets 2 balls, and C gets 2 balls.
- Case 2: A gets 2 balls, B gets 3 balls, and C gets 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the number of possible outcomes for Case 1.
In Case 1, the distribution is A: 2, B: 2, C: 2.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is: C(6, 2) = 6!/(2!(6-2)!) = 15
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B is: C(4, 2) = 4!/(2!(4-2)!) = 6
The number of ways to choose the remaining 2 balls for child C is: C(2, 2) = 2!/(2!(2-2)!) = 1
Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for Case 1 = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of possible outcomes for Case 2.
In Case 2, the distribution is A: 2, B: 3, C: 1.
The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 6 for child A is: C(6, 2) = 15
The number of ways to choose 3 balls out of the remaining 4 balls for child B is: C(4, 3) = 4!/(3!(4-3)!) = 4
The number of ways to choose the remaining 1 ball for child C is: C(1, 1) = 1
Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for Case 2 = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 3: Compare the number of possible outcomes for each case.
The number of possible outcomes for Case 1 (90) is greater than the number of possible outcomes for Case 2 (60).

Therefore, the answer is:
{case: 1}
