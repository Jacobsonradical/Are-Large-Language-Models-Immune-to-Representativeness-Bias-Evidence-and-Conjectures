To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways each case can occur and compare them.

Given:
- There are 6 distinguishable balls.
- The balls are distributed randomly among three children: A, B, and C.

Case 1: A has 2 balls, B has 2 balls, and C has 2 balls.
Case 2: A has 2 balls, B has 3 balls, and C has 1 ball.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible arrangements.
Total number of arrangements = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Step 2: Calculate the number of arrangements for Case 1.
Number of arrangements for Case 1 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 2) × (2 choose 2) = 15 × 6 × 1 = 90

Step 3: Calculate the number of arrangements for Case 2.
Number of arrangements for Case 2 = (6 choose 2) × (4 choose 3) × (1 choose 1) = 15 × 4 × 1 = 60

Step 4: Compare the number of arrangements for each case.
Case 1 has 90 arrangements, while Case 2 has 60 arrangements.

Therefore, there will be more results of Case 1 than Case 2 in many rounds of the game.
